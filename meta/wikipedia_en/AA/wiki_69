{"id": "7885", "revid": "41056544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7885", "title": "Dance", "text": "Dance is an art form, consisting of sequences of body movements with aesthetic and often symbolic value, either improvised or purposefully selected. Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements or by its historical period or place of origin. Dance is typically performed with musical accompaniment, and sometimes with the dancer simultaneously using a musical instrument themselves.\nThere are two different types of dance: theatrical and participatory dance. Both types of dance may have special functions, whether social, ceremonial, competitive, erotic, martial, sacred or liturgical. Dance is not solely restricted to performance, as dance is used as a form of exercise and occasionally training for other sports and activities. Dance performances and dancing competitions are found across the world exhibiting various different styles and standards.\nTheatrical and participatory dance.\nTheatrical dance, also called performance or concert dance, is intended primarily as a spectacle, usually a performance upon a stage by virtuoso dancers. It often tells a story, perhaps using mime, costume and scenery, or it may interpret the musical accompaniment, which is often specially composed and performed in a theatre setting but it is not a requirement. Examples are Western ballet and modern dance, Classical Indian dance such as Bharatanatyam, and Chinese and Japanese song and dance dramas, such as the dragon dance. Most classical forms are centred upon dance alone, but performance dance may also appear in opera and other forms of musical theatre.\nParticipatory dance, whether it be a folk dance, a social dance, a group dance such as a line, circle, chain or square dance, or a partner dance, such as in Western ballroom dancing, is undertaken primarily for a common purpose, such as social interaction or exercise, or building flexibility of participants rather than to serve any benefit to onlookers. Such dance seldom has any narrative. A group dance and a \"corps de ballet\", a social partner dance and a \"pas de deux\", differ profoundly. Even a solo dance or interpretive dance may be undertaken solely for the satisfaction of the dancer. Participatory dancers often all employ the same movements and steps but, for example, in the rave culture of electronic dance music, vast crowds may engage in free dance, uncoordinated with those around them. On the other hand, some cultures lay down strict rules as to the particular dances people may or must participate.\nHistory.\nArchaeological evidence for early dance includes 10,000-years-old paintings in Madhya Pradesh, India at the Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka, and Egyptian tomb paintings depicting dancing figures, dated . It has been proposed that before the invention of written languages, dance was an important part of the oral and performance methods of passing stories down from one generation to the next. The use of dance in ecstatic trance states and healing rituals (as observed today in many contemporary indigenous cultures) is thought to have been another early factor in the social development of dance.\nReferences to dance can be found in very early recorded history; Greek dance (\"choros\") is referred to by Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch and Lucian. The Bible and Talmud refer to many events related to dance, and contain over 30 different dance terms. In Chinese pottery as early as the Neolithic period, groups of people are depicted dancing in a line holding hands, and the earliest Chinese word for \"dance\" is found written in the oracle bones. Dance is described in the \"L\u00fcshi Chunqiu\". Primitive dance in ancient China was associated with sorcery and shamanic rituals.\nDuring the first millennium BCE in India, many texts were composed which attempted to codify aspects of daily life. Bharata Muni's \"Natya Shastra\" (literally \"the text of dramaturgy\") is one early text. It mainly deals with drama, in which dance plays an important part in Indian culture. A strong continuous tradition of dance has since continued in India, through to modern times, where it continues to play a role in culture, ritual, and the Bollywood entertainment industry. Many other contemporary dance forms can likewise be traced back to historical, traditional, ceremonial, and ethnic dance.\nMusic.\nDance is generally, but not exclusively, performed with the accompaniment of music and may or may not be performed in time to such music. Some dance (such as tap dance or gumboot dance) may provide its own audible accompaniment in place of (or in addition to) music. Many early forms of music and dance were created for each other and are frequently performed together. Notable examples of traditional dance-music couplings include the jig, waltz, tango, disco, and salsa. Some musical genres have a parallel dance form such as baroque music and baroque dance; other varieties of dance and music may share nomenclature but developed separately, such as classical music and classical ballet. The choreography and music are meant to complement each other, to express a story told by the choreographer and dancers.\nRhythm.\nRhythm and dance are deeply linked in history and practice. The American dancer Ted Shawn wrote; \"The conception of rhythm which underlies all studies of the dance is something about which we could talk forever, and still not finish.\" A musical rhythm requires two main elements; a regularly-repeating pulse (also called the \"beat\" or \"tactus\") that establishes the tempo, and a pattern of accents and rests that establishes the character of the metre or basic rhythmic pattern. The basic pulse is roughly equal in duration to a simple step or gesture.\nDances generally have a characteristic tempo and rhythmic pattern. The tango, for example, is usually danced in time at approximately 66 beats per minute. The basic slow step, called a \"slow\", lasts for one beat, so that a full \"right\u2013left\" step is equal to one measure. The basic forward and backward walk of the dance is so counted \u2013 \"slow-slow\" \u2013 while many additional figures are counted \"slow \u2013 quick-quick\".\nRepetitive body movements often depend on alternating \"strong\" and \"weak\" muscular movements. Given this alternation of left-right, of forward-backward and rise-fall, along with the bilateral symmetry of the human body, many dances and much music are in duple and quadruple meter. Since some such movements require more time in one phase than the other \u2013 such as the longer time required to lift a hammer than to strike \u2013 some dance rhythms fall into triple metre. Occasionally, as in the folk dances of the Balkans, dance traditions depend heavily on more complex rhythms. Complex dances composed of a fixed sequence of steps require phrases and melodies of a certain fixed length to accompany that sequence.\nMusical accompaniment arose in the earliest dance, so that ancient Egyptians attributed the origin of the dance to the divine Athotus, who was said to have observed that music accompanying religious rituals caused participants to move rhythmically and to have brought these movements into proportional measure. The idea that dance arises from musical rhythm, was found in renaissance Europe, in the works of the dancer Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro. Pesaro speaks of dance as a physical movement that arises from and expresses inward, spiritual motion agreeing with the \"measures and perfect concords of harmony\" that fall upon the human ear, while earlier, Mechthild of Magdeburg, seizing upon dance as a symbol of the holy life foreshadowed in Jesus' saying \"I have piped and ye have not danced\", writes;\nThoinot Arbeau's celebrated 16th-century dance-treatise \"Orch\u00e9sographie\", indeed, begins with definitions of over eighty distinct drum-rhythms.\nDance has been represented through the ages as having emerged as a response to music yet, as Lincoln Kirstein implied, it is at least as likely that primitive music arose from dance. Shawn concurs, stating that dance \"was the first art of the human race, and the matrix out of which all other arts grew\" and that even the \"metre in our poetry today is a result of the accents necessitated by body movement, as the dancing and reciting was performed simultaneously\" \u2013 an assertion somewhat supported by the common use of the term \"foot\" to describe the fundamental rhythmic units of poetry.\nScholes, a musician, offers support for this view, stating that the steady measures of music, of two, three or four beats to the bar, its equal and balanced phrases, regular cadences, contrasts and repetitions, may all be attributed to the \"incalculable\" influence of dance upon music.\nHence, Shawn asserts, \"it is quite possible to develop the dance without music and... music is perfectly capable of standing on its own feet without any assistance from the dance\", nevertheless the \"two arts will always be related and the relationship can be profitable both to the dance and to music\", the precedence of one art over the other being a moot point. The common ballad measures of hymns and folk-songs takes their name from dance, as does the carol, originally a circle dance. Many purely musical pieces have been named \"waltz\" or \"minuet\", for example, while many concert dances have been produced that are based upon abstract musical pieces, such as \"2 and 3 Part Inventions, Adams Violin Concerto\" and \"Andantino\". Similarly, poems are often structured and named after dances or musical works, while dance and music have both drawn their conception of \"measure\" or \"metre\" from poetry.\nShawn quotes with approval the statement of Dalcroze that, while the art of musical rhythm consists in differentiating and combining time durations, pauses and accents \"according to physiological law\", that of \"plastic rhythm\" (i.e. dance) \"is to designate movement in space, to interpret long time-values by slow movements and short ones by quick movements, regulate pauses by their divers successions and express sound accentuations in their multiple nuances by additions of bodily weight, by means of muscular innervations\".\nShawn points out that the system of musical time is a \"man-made, artificial thing... a manufactured tool, whereas rhythm is something that has always existed and depends on man not at all\", being \"the continuous flowing time which our human minds cut up into convenient units\", suggesting that music might be revivified by a return to the values and the time-perception of dancing.\nThe early-20th-century American dancer Helen Moller stated that \"it is rhythm and form more than harmony and color which, from the beginning, has bound music, poetry and dancing together in a union that is indissoluble.\"\nApproaches.\nTheatrical.\nConcert dance, like opera, generally depends for its large-scale form upon a narrative dramatic structure. The movements and gestures of the choreography are primarily intended to mime the personality and aims of the characters and their part in the plot. Such theatrical requirements tend towards longer, freer movements than those usual in non-narrative dance styles. On the other hand, the \"ballet blanc\", developed in the 19th century, allows interludes of rhythmic dance that developed into entirely \"plotless\" ballets in the 20th century and that allowed fast, rhythmic dance-steps such as those of the \"petit allegro\". A well-known example is \"The Cygnets' Dance\" in act two of \"Swan Lake\".\nThe ballet developed out of courtly dramatic productions of 16th- and 17th-century France and Italy and for some time dancers performed dances developed from those familiar from the musical suite, all of which were defined by definite rhythms closely identified with each dance. These appeared as character dances in the era of romantic nationalism.\nBallet reached widespread vogue in the romantic era, accompanied by a larger orchestra and grander musical conceptions that did not lend themselves easily to rhythmic clarity and by dance that emphasised dramatic mime. A broader concept of rhythm was needed, that which Rudolf Laban terms the \"rhythm and shape\" of movement that communicates character, emotion and intention, while only certain scenes required the exact synchronisation of step and music essential to other dance styles, so that, to Laban, modern Europeans seemed totally unable to grasp the meaning of \"primitive rhythmic movements\", a situation that began to change in the 20th century with such productions as Igor Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring\" with its new rhythmic language evoking primal feelings of a primitive past.\nIndian classical dance styles, like ballet, are often in dramatic form, so that there is a similar complementarity between narrative expression and \"pure\" dance. In this case, the two are separately defined, though not always separately performed. The rhythmic elements, which are abstract and technical, are known as \"nritta\". Both this and expressive dance \"(nritya)\", though, are closely tied to the rhythmic system (\"tala\"). Teachers have adapted the spoken rhythmic mnemonic system called \"bol\" to the needs of dancers.\nJapanese classical dance-theatre styles such as Kabuki and Noh, like Indian dance-drama, distinguish between narrative and abstract dance productions. The three main categories of kabuki are \"jidaimono\" (historical), \"sewamono\" (domestic) and \"shosagoto\" (dance pieces). Somewhat similarly, Noh distinguishes between \"Geki Noh\", based around the advancement of plot and the narration of action, and \"Fury\u016b Noh\", dance pieces involving acrobatics, stage properties, multiple characters and elaborate stage action.\nParticipatory and Social.\nSocial dances, those intended for participation rather than for an audience, may include various forms of mime and narrative, but are typically set much more closely to the rhythmic pattern of music, so that terms like waltz and polka refer as much to musical pieces as to the dance itself. The rhythm of the dancers' feet may even form an essential part of the music, as in tap dance. African dance, for example, is rooted in fixed basic steps, but may also allow a high degree of rhythmic interpretation: the feet or the trunk mark the basic pulse while cross-rhythms are picked up by shoulders, knees, or head, with the best dancers simultaneously giving plastic expression to all the elements of the polyrhythmic pattern.\nCultural traditions.\nAfrica.\nDance in Africa is deeply integrated into society and major events in a community are frequently reflected in dances: dances are performed for births and funerals, weddings and wars. Traditional dances impart cultural morals, including religious traditions and sexual standards; give vent to repressed emotions, such as grief; motivate community members to cooperate, whether fighting wars or grinding grain; enact spiritual rituals; and contribute to social cohesiveness.\nThousands of dances are performed around the continent. These may be divided into traditional, neotraditional, and classical styles: folkloric dances of a particular society, dances created more recently in imitation of traditional styles, and dances transmitted more formally in schools or private lessons. African dance has been altered by many forces, such as European missionaries and colonialist governments, who often suppressed local dance traditions as licentious or distracting. Dance in contemporary African cultures still serves its traditional functions in new contexts; dance may celebrate the inauguration of a hospital, build community for rural migrants in unfamiliar cities, and be incorporated into Christian church ceremonies.\nAsia.\nAll Indian classical dances are to varying degrees rooted in the \"Natyashastra\" and therefore share common features: for example, the \"mudra\"s (hand positions), some body positions, leg movement and the inclusion of dramatic or expressive acting or abhinaya. Indian classical music provides accompaniment and dancers of nearly all the styles wear bells around their ankles to counterpoint and complement the percussion.\nThere are now many regional varieties of Indian classical dance. Dances like \"Odra Magadhi\", which after decades-long debate, has been traced to present day Mithila, Odisha region's dance form of Odissi (Orissi), indicate influence of dances in cultural interactions between different regions.\nThe Punjab area overlapping India and Pakistan is the place of origin of Bhangra. It is widely known both as a style of music and a dance. It is mostly related to ancient harvest celebrations, love, patriotism or social issues. Its music is coordinated by a musical instrument called the 'Dhol'. Bhangra is not just music but a dance, a celebration of the harvest where people beat the dhol (drum), sing Boliyaan (lyrics) and dance. It developed further with the Vaisakhi festival of the Sikhs.\nThe dances of Sri Lanka include the devil dances (\"yakun natima\"), a carefully crafted ritual reaching far back into Sri Lanka's pre-Buddhist past that combines ancient \"Ayurvedic\" concepts of disease causation with psychological manipulation and combines many aspects including Sinhalese cosmology. Their influence can be seen on the classical dances of Sri Lanka.\nIndonesian dances reflect the richness and diversity of Indonesian ethnic groups and cultures. There are more than 1,300 ethnic groups in Indonesia, it can be seen from the cultural roots of the Austronesian and Melanesian peoples, and various cultural influences from Asia and the west. Dances in Indonesia originate from ritual movements and religious ceremonies, this kind of dance usually begins with rituals, such as war dances, shaman dances to cure or ward off disease, dances to call rain and other types of dances. With the acceptance of dharma religion in the 1st century in Indonesia, Hinduism and Buddhist rituals were celebrated in various artistic performances. Hindu epics such as the Ramayana, Mahabharata and also the Panji became the inspiration to be shown in a dance-drama called \"Sendratari\" resembling \"ballet\" in the western tradition. An elaborate and highly stylized dance method was invented and has survived to this day, especially on the islands of Java and Bali. The Javanese Wayang wong dance takes footage from the Ramayana or Mahabharata episodes, but this dance is very different from the Indian version, indonesian dances do not pay as much attention to the \"mudras\" as Indian dances: even more to show local forms. The sacred Javanese ritual dance Bedhaya is believed to date back to the Majapahit period in the 14th century or even earlier, this dance originated from ritual dances performed by virgin girls to worship Hindu Gods such as Shiva, Brahma, and Vishnu. In Bali, dance has become an integral part of the sacred Hindu Dharma rituals. Some experts believe that Balinese dance comes from an older dance tradition from Java. Reliefs from temples in East Java from the 14th century feature crowns and headdresses similar to the headdresses used in Balinese dance today. Islam began to spread to the Indonesian archipelago when indigenous dances and dharma dances were still popular. Artists and dancers still use styles from the previous era, replacing stories with more Islamic interpretations and clothing that is more closed according to Islamic teachings.\nThe dances of the Middle East are usually the traditional forms of circle dancing which are modernized to an extent. They would include dabke, tamzara, Assyrian folk dance, Kurdish dance, Armenian dance and Turkish dance, among others. All these forms of dances would usually involve participants engaging each other by holding hands or arms (depending on the style of the dance). They would make rhythmic moves with their legs and shoulders as they curve around the dance floor. The head of the dance would generally hold a cane or handkerchief.\nEurope and North America.\nFolk dances vary across Europe and may date back hundreds or thousands of years, but many have features in common such as group participation led by a caller, hand-holding or arm-linking between participants, and fixed musical forms known as caroles. Some, such as the maypole dance are common to many nations, while others such as the c\u00e9ilidh and the polka are deeply-rooted in a single culture. Some European folk dances such as the square dance were brought to the New World and subsequently became part of American culture.\nBallet developed first in Italy and then in France from lavish court spectacles that combined rhythm, drama, poetry, song, costumes and dance. Members of the court nobility took part as performers. During the reign of Louis XIV, himself a dancer, dance became more codified. Professional dancers began to take the place of court amateurs, and ballet masters were licensed by the French government. The first ballet dance academy was the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Danse (Royal Dance Academy), opened in Paris in 1661. Shortly thereafter, the first institutionalized ballet troupe, associated with the academy, was formed; this troupe began as an all-male ensemble but by 1681 opened to include women as well.\n20th century concert dance brought an explosion of innovation in dance style characterized by an exploration of freer technique. Early pioneers of what became known as modern dance include Loie Fuller, Isadora Duncan, Mary Wigman and Ruth St. Denis. The relationship of music to dance serves as the basis for Eurhythmics, devised by Emile Jaques-Dalcroze, which was influential to the development of Modern dance and modern ballet through artists such as Marie Rambert. Eurythmy, developed by Rudolf Steiner and Marie Steiner-von Sivers, combines formal elements reminiscent of traditional dance with the new freer style, and introduced a complex new vocabulary to dance. In the 1920s, important founders of the new style such as Martha Graham and Doris Humphrey began their work. Since this time, a wide variety of dance styles have been developed; see Modern dance.\nAfrican American dance developed in everyday spaces, rather than in dance studios, schools or companies. Tap dance, disco, jazz dance, swing dance, hip hop dance, the lindy hop with its relationship to rock and roll music and rock and roll dance have had a global influence. Dance styles fusing classical ballet technique with African-American dance have also appeared in the 21st century, including Hiplet.\nLatin America.\nDance is central to Latin American social life and culture. Brazilian Samba, Argentinian tango, and Cuban salsa are internationally popular partner dances, and other national dances\u2014merengue, cueca, plena, jarabe, joropo, marinera, cumbia, bachata and others\u2014are important components of their respective countries' cultures. Traditional Carnival festivals incorporate these and other dances in enormous celebrations.\nDance has played an important role in forging a collective identity among the many cultural and ethnic groups of Latin America. Dance served to unite the many African, European, and indigenous peoples of the region. Certain dance genres, such as capoeira, and body movements, especially the characteristic \"quebradas\" or pelvis swings, have been variously banned and celebrated throughout Latin American history.\nEducation.\nDance studies are offered through the arts and humanities programs of many higher education institutions. Some universities offer Bachelor of Arts and higher academic degrees in Dance. A dance study curriculum may encompass a diverse range of courses and topics, including dance practice and performance, choreography, ethnochoreology, kinesiology, dance notation, and dance therapy. Most recently, dance and movement therapy has been integrated in some schools into math lessons for students with learning disabilities, emotional or behavioral disabilities, as well as for those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nDance is taught to all ages ranging from two years old to the adult level outside of a professional dance setting. Typically this dance education is seen in dance studio businesses across the world. Some K-12 public schools have provided the opportunity for students to take beginner level dance classes, as well as participate in dance teams that perform at school events. \nOccupations.\nDancers.\nProfessional dancers are usually employed on contract or for particular performances or productions. The professional life of a dancer is generally one of constantly changing work situations, strong competitive pressure and low pay. Consequently, professional dancers often must supplement their incomes to achieve financial stability. In the U.S. many professional dancers belong to unions (such as the American Guild of Musical Artists, Screen Actors Guild and Actors' Equity Association) that establish working conditions and minimum salaries for their members. Professional dancers must possess large amounts of athleticism. To lead a successful career, it is advantageous to be versatile in many styles of dance, have a strong technical background and to use other forms of physical training to remain fit and healthy.\nTeachers.\nDance teachers typically focus on teaching dance performance, or coaching competitive dancers, or both. They typically have performance experience in the types of dance they teach or coach. For example, dancesport teachers and coaches are often tournament dancers or former dancesport performers. Dance teachers may be self-employed, or employed by dance schools or general education institutions with dance programs. Some work for university programs or other schools that are associated with professional classical dance (e.g., ballet) or modern dance companies. Others are employed by smaller, privately owned dance schools that offer dance training and performance coaching for various types of dance.\nChoreographers.\nChoreographers are the ones that design the dancing movements within a dance, they are often university trained and are typically employed for particular projects or, more rarely may work on contract as the resident choreographer for a specific dance company.\nCompetitions.\nA dance competition is an organized event in which contestants perform dances before a judge or judges for awards, and in some cases, monetary prizes. There are several major types of dance competitions, distinguished primarily by the style or styles of dances performed. Dance competitions are an excellent setting to build connections with industry leading faculty members, adjudicators, choreographers and other dancers from competing studios. A typical dance competition for younger pre-professional dancers can last anywhere between two and four days, depending whether it is a regional or national competition.\nThe purpose of dance competitions is to provide a fun and educative place for dancers and give them the opportunity to perform their choreographed routines from their current dance season onstage. Oftentimes, competitions will take place in a professional setting or may vary to non-performance spaces, such as a high school theatre. The results of the dancers are then dictated by a credible panel of judges and are evaluated on their performance than given a score. As far as competitive categories go, most competitions base their categories according to the dance style, age, experience level and the number of dancers competing in the routine. Major types of dance competitions include:\nDance diplomacy.\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, cultural exchange of dance was a common feature of international diplomacy, especially amongst East and South Asian nations. The People's Republic of China, for example, developed a formula for dance diplomacy that sought to learn from and express respect for the aesthetic traditions of recently independent states that were former European colonies, such as Indonesia, India, and Burma, as a show of anti-colonial solidarity.\nHealth.\nFootwear.\nIn most forms of dance the foot is the source of movement, and in some cases require specific shoes to aid in the health, safety ability of the dancer, depending on the type of dance, the intensity of the movements, and the surface that will be danced on.\nDance footwear can be potentially both supportive and or restrictive to the movement of the dancer. The effectiveness of the shoe is related to its ability to help the foot do something it is not intended to do, or to make easier a difficult movement. Such effects relate to health and safety because of the function of the equipment as unnatural to the bodies usual mobility.\nBallet.\nBallet is notable for the risks of injury due to the biomechanics of the ankle and the toes as the main support for the rest of the movements. With the pointe shoe, the design specifically brings all of the toes together to allow the toes to be stood on for longer periods of time.\nThere are accessories associated with pointe shoes that help to mitigate injury and soothe pain while dancing, including things such as toe pads, toe tape, and cushions.\nBody image.\nDancers are publicly thought to be very preoccupied with their body image to fit a certain mold in the industry. Research indicates that dancers do have greater difficulty controlling their eating habits as a large quantity strive for the art-form's ideal body mass. Some dancers often resort to abusive tactics to maintain a certain image. Common scenarios include dancers abusing laxatives for weight control and end up falling into unhealthy eating disorders. Studies show that a large quantity of dancers use at least one method of weight control including over exercising and food restriction. The pressure for dancers to maintain a below average weight affects their eating and weight controlling behaviours and their life-style. Due to its artistic nature, dancers tend to have many hostile self-critical tendencies. Commonly seen in performers, it is likely that a variety of individuals may be resistant to concepts of self-compassion.\nEating disorders.\nIn North America, eating disorders present a significant public health challenge, with an estimated 10% of young girls affected. Those engaged in aesthetic-focused sports like dance face even greater risks due to intense pressures for a slender physique. Eating disorders in dancers are generally very common. Through data analysis and studies published, sufficient data regarding the percentage and accuracy dancers have of realistically falling into unhealthy disordered eating habits or the development of an eating disorder were extracted. Dancers, in general, have a higher risk of developing eating disorders than the general public, primarily falling into anorexia nervosa and EDNOS. Research has yet to distinguish a direct correlation regarding dancers having a higher risk of developing bulimia nervosa. Studies concluded that dancers overall have a three times higher risk of developing eating disorders, more specifically anorexia nervosa and EDNOS.\nDance on social media.\nDance has become a popular form of content across many social media platforms, including TikTok. During 2020, TikTok dances offered the opportunity for isolated individuals to interact and connect with one another through a virtual format. Since its debut in 2017, the app has also attracted a small but growing audience of professional dancers in their early 20s to 30s. While the majority of this demographic is more accustomed to performing onstage, this app introduced a new means to generate professional exposure."}

She starred in the Netflix comedy horror series \"Santa Clarita Diet\" (2017\u20132019) and has hosted the talk show \"The Drew Barrymore Show\" since 2020. In September 2023, she announced she would return to the show without writers during the then-ongoing WGA strike, but after backlash, reversed the decision the same month.\nBarrymore is the founder of the production company Flower Films and has starred in several of its projects. She launched a range of cosmetics under the Flower banner in 2013. Her other business ventures include a range of wines, homeware and clothing. She has released four books including her memoir \"Little Girl Lost\" (1990) and her photobook \"Find It in Everything\" (2014), both of which were \"New York Times\" bestsellers.\nEarly life.\nAncestry.\nDrew Blythe Barrymore was born on February 22, 1975, in Culver City, California, to actor John Drew Barrymore and aspiring actress Jaid Barrymore (born Ildik\u00f3 Jaid Mak\u00f3), who was born in a displaced persons camp in Brannenburg, West Germany, to Hungarian World War II refugees. Through her father, Barrymore has three older half-siblings, including actor John Blyth Barrymore. Her parents divorced in 1984.\nIn 2023, Barrymore displayed an AncestryDNA test onscreen on her talk show, which assessed her genetic ancestry as primarily European, with 6% Northern Indian.\nBarrymore was born into an acting family. All of her paternal great-grandparents, Maurice and Georgie Drew Barrymore, Maurice and Mae Costello (n\u00e9e Altschuk), and her paternal grandparents, John Barrymore and Dolores Costello, were actors, with John being arguably the most acclaimed actor of his generation. Barrymore is a niece of Diana Barrymore, a grandniece of Lionel Barrymore, Ethel Barrymore and Helene Costello, and a great-great-granddaughter of Irish-born John and English-born Louisa Lane Drew, all of whom were also actors. She is a great-grandniece of Broadway idol John Drew Jr. and silent film actor, writer and director Sidney Drew.\nBarrymore's godmothers are actress Sophia Loren and Lee Strasberg's widow, Anna Strasberg; Barrymore described her relationship with the latter as one that \"would become so important to me as a kid because she was so kind and nurturing.\" Her godfather is filmmaker Steven Spielberg.\nBarrymore's first name, Drew, was the maiden name of her paternal great-grandmother Georgie Drew, and her middle name, Blythe, was derived from the birth surname (Blyth) of her great-grandfather who later took the stage name of Maurice Barrymore. In her 1991 autobiography \"Little Girl Lost\", Barrymore recounted early memories of her abusive father, who left the family when she was six months old. She and her father never had a significant relationship and seldom spoke.\nChildhood.\nBarrymore grew up on Poinsettia Place in West Hollywood, until she moved to Sherman Oaks at the age of seven. In her 2015 memoir \"Wildflower\", she says she spoke \"like a valley girl\" because she grew up in Sherman Oaks. She moved back to West Hollywood on becoming emancipated at age 14. She attended elementary school at Fountain Day School in West Hollywood and Country School. In the wake of her sudden stardom, Barrymore endured a notoriously troubled childhood. She was a regular at Studio 54 as a young girl, and her nightlife and constant partying became a popular subject with the media. She was placed in rehab at 13, and spent eighteen months in an institution for the mentally ill. A suicide attempt at 14 put her back in rehab, followed by a three-month stay with singer David Crosby and his wife. The stay was precipitated, Crosby said, because she \"needed to be around some people that were committed to sobriety.\" Barrymore described this period of her life for \"Little Girl Lost.\" After a successful juvenile court petition for emancipation, she moved into her own apartment at the age of 15.\nCareer.\n1980\u20131989: Early roles as a childhood actress.\nBarrymore appeared in a dog food commercial when she was eleven months old. After her film debut with a small role in \"Altered States\", she played Gertie in \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\". Director Steven Spielberg felt she had the right imagination for the role after she impressed him with a story that she led a punk rock band. \"E.T.\" was the highest-grossing film of the 1980s and made Barrymore one of the most famous child actors of the time.

When the production of \"Donnie Darko\" was threatened, Barrymore stepped forward with financing from the company and played the title character's English teacher.

Along with co-star Timothy Olyphant, Barrymore served as an executive producer on the single-camera series, which was favorably received upon its premiere; \"Rolling Stone\" felt that \"much of [the series' laughs] comes down to the uncrushable Drew Barrymore charm\" and furthermore remarked: \"The show is a welcome comeback for Barrymore, the eternally beloved grunge-era wild thing\u2014it's not just her big move into TV, but her first high-profile performance anywhere in years. In a way, it circles back to the roles she was doing in the early [90s], playing deadly vixens in flicks like \"Guncrazy\" or \"Doppelganger\"\".\n2020\u2013present: \"The Drew Barrymore Show\".\nBarrymore starred in Jamie Babbit's film \"The Stand In\".

Due to these events, the National Book Foundation removed Barrymore from being the host of the then upcoming 74th National Book Awards. Barrymore apologized for her actions later that week in a video on Instagram, claiming that, \"I believe there's nothing I can do or say in this moment to make it OK.\" Barrymore deleted the apology video from her account following criticism. On the 17th, Barrymore announced on her Instagram account that she would be postponing production of her talk show until the strike ends due to the backlash, writing, \"I have listened to everyone, and I am making the decision to pause the show's premiere until the strike is over\u201d. She also added, \u201cI have no words to express my deepest apologies to anyone I have hurt, and, of course, to our incredible team who works on the show and has made it what it is today\u201d. A spokesperson for CBS Media Ventures said, \"We support Drew's decision to pause the show's return and understand how complex and difficult this process has been for her.\"\nMedia image.\nBarrymore became a CoverGirl Cosmetics' model and spokeswoman in 2007.

{"id": "7888", "revid": "1271552000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7888", "title": "D. W. Griffith", "text": "David Wark Griffith (January 22, 1875 \u2013 July 23, 1948) was an American film director. Considered one of the most influential figures in the history of the motion picture, he pioneered many aspects of film editing and expanded the art of the narrative film.\nTo modern audiences, Griffith is known primarily for directing the 1915 film \"The Birth of a Nation\". One of the most financially successful films of all time and considered a landmark by film historians, it has attracted much controversy for its degrading portrayals of African Americans, its glorification of the Ku Klux Klan, and support for the Confederacy. The film led to riots in several major cities all over the United States and the NAACP attempted to have it banned. Griffith made his next film \"Intolerance\" (1916) as an answer to critics, who he felt unfairly maligned his work.\nTogether with Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and Douglas Fairbanks, Griffith founded the studio United Artists in 1919 with the goal of enabling actors and directors to make films on their own terms, as opposed to the terms of commercial studios. Several of Griffith's later films were successful, including \"Broken Blossoms\" (1919), \"Way Down East\" (1920), and \"Orphans of the Storm\" (1921), but the high costs he incurred for production and promotion often led to commercial failure. He had made roughly 500 films by the time of \"The Struggle\" (1931), his final feature, and all but three were completely silent.\nEarly life.\nGriffith was born on January 22, 1875, on a farm in Oldham County, Kentucky, the son of Jacob Wark \"Roaring Jake\" Griffith, a Confederate Army colonel in the American Civil War who was elected as a Kentucky state legislator, and Mary Perkins (n\u00e9e Oglesby). Griffith was raised as a Methodist, and he attended a one-room schoolhouse, where he was taught by his older sister Mattie. His father died when he was 10, and the family struggled with poverty.\nWhen Griffith was 14, his mother abandoned the farm and moved the family to Louisville, Kentucky; there she opened a boarding house, which was unsuccessful. Griffith then left high school to help support the family, taking a job in a dry goods store and later in a bookstore. He began his creative career as an actor in touring companies. Meanwhile, he was learning how to become a playwright, but he had little success. Only one of his plays was accepted for a performance. He traveled to New York City in 1907 in an attempt to sell a script to Edison Studios producer Edwin Porter; although Porter rejected the script, he gave Griffith an acting part in \"Rescued from an Eagle's Nest\" instead. As a result of this experience, Griffith decided to try his luck as an actor, and he appeared in many films as an extra.\nEarly film career.\nIn 1908, Griffith accepted a role as a stage extra in \"Professional Jealousy\" for the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company, where he met cameraman Billy Bitzer. In 1908, Biograph's main director Wallace McCutcheon Sr. fell ill, and his son Wallace McCutcheon Jr. took his place. McCutcheon Jr. did not bring the studio success; Biograph co-founder Harry Marvin then gave Griffith the position, and he made the short \"The Adventures of Dollie\". He directed a total of 48 shorts for the company that year.\nAmong the films he directed in 1909 was \"The Cricket on the Hearth\", an adaptation of Charles Dickens' novel. Showing the influence of Dickens on his own film narrative, Griffith employed the technique of cross-cutting\u2014where two stories run alongside each other, as seen in Dickens' novels such as \"Oliver Twist\". When criticized by a cameraman for doing this technique in a later film, Griffith was said to have replied \"Well, doesn't Dickens write that way?\".\nHis short \"In Old California\" (1910) was the first film shot in Hollywood, California. Four years later, he produced and directed his first feature film \"Judith of Bethulia\" (1914), one of the early films to be produced in the U.S. Biograph believed that longer features were not viable at this point. According to Lillian Gish, the company thought that \"a movie that long would hurt [the audience's] eyes\".\nGriffith left Biograph because of company resistance to his goals and his cost overruns on the film. He took his company of actors with him and joined the Mutual Film Corporation. There he co-produced \"The Life of General Villa\", a silent biographical-action movie starring Pancho Villa as himself, shot on location in Mexico during a civil war. He formed a studio with Majestic Studios manager Harry Aitken, which became known as Reliance-Majestic Studios and later was renamed Fine Arts Studios. His new production company became an autonomous production unit partner in the Triangle Film Corporation along with Thomas H. Ince and Keystone Studios' Mack Sennett. The Triangle Film Corporation was headed by Aitken, who was released from the Mutual Film Corporation, and his brother Roy.\nGriffith directed and produced \"The Clansman\" through Reliance-Majestic Studios in 1915. The film later became known as \"The Birth of a Nation\". It is one of the early feature length American films. The film was a success, but its depiction of slavery, the Ku Klux Klan, race relations in the American Civil War, and the Reconstruction era of the United States aroused much controversy. It was based on Thomas Dixon Jr.'s 1905 novel \"\", which casts Southern slavery as benign, the enfranchisement of freedmen as a corrupt plot by the Republican Party, and the Ku Klux Klan as a band of heroes restoring the rightful order. This view of the era was popular at the time and was endorsed for decades by historians of the Dunning School, but it met with strong criticism from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and other groups.\nThe NAACP attempted to stop showings of the film. This ban was successful in some cities, but nonetheless it was shown widely and became the most successful box-office attraction of its time. It is considered among the first \"blockbuster\" motion pictures, and it broke all box-office records that had been established until then. \"They lost track of the money it made\", Lillian Gish remarked in a Kevin Brownlow interview.\nAudiences in some major northern cities rioted over the film's racial content and the violence. Griffith's indignation at efforts to censor or ban the film motivated him the following year to produce \"Intolerance\", in which he portrayed the effects of intolerance in four different historical periods: the Fall of Babylon; the Crucifixion of Jesus; the events surrounding the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre (during religious persecution of French Huguenots); and a modern story. \"Intolerance\" was not a financial success; it did not bring in enough profits to cover the lavish road show that accompanied it. Griffith put a huge budget into the film's production that could not be recovered in its box office. He mostly financed \"Intolerance\" himself, which contributed to his financial ruin for the rest of his life.\nGriffith's production partnership was dissolved in 1917, and he went to Artcraft, part of Paramount Pictures, and then to First National Pictures (1919\u20131920). At the same time, he founded United Artists together with Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and Douglas Fairbanks; the studio was based on allowing actors to control their own interests rather than being dependent upon commercial studios.\nHe continued to make films, but he never again achieved box-office grosses as high as either \"The Birth of a Nation\" or \"Intolerance\".\nLater film career.\nAlthough United Artists survived as a company, Griffith's association with it was short-lived. While some of his later films did well at the box office, commercial success often eluded him. Griffith features from this period include \"Broken Blossoms\" (1919), \"Way Down East\" (1920), \"Orphans of the Storm\" (1921), \"Dream Street\" (1921), \"One Exciting Night\" (1922), \"The White Rose\" (1923), \"America\" (1924) and \"Isn't Life Wonderful\" (1924). Of these, the first three were successes at the box office. Griffith was forced to leave United Artists after \"Isn't Life Wonderful\" (1924) failed at the box office.\nHe made \"Lady of the Pavements\" (1929), a part sound film, and only two full-sound films: \"Abraham Lincoln\" (1930) and \"The Struggle\" (1931). Neither was successful, and after \"The Struggle\", he never made another film.\nIn 1936, director Woody Van Dyke, who had worked as Griffith's apprentice on \"Intolerance\", asked Griffith to help him shoot the famous earthquake sequence for \"San Francisco\", but Griffith was not given any film credit. Starring Clark Gable, Jeanette MacDonald and Spencer Tracy, it was the top-grossing film of the year.\nIn 1939, the producer Hal Roach hired Griffith to produce \"Of Mice and Men\" (1939) and \"One Million B.C.\" (1940). He wrote to Griffith: \"I need help from the production side to select the proper writers, cast, et cetera, and to help me generally in the supervision of these pictures.\"\nAlthough Griffith eventually disagreed with Roach over the production and departed, Roach later insisted that some of the scenes in the completed film were directed by Griffith. This movie was the final production in which Griffith was involved. However, cast members' accounts recall Griffith directing only the screen tests and costume tests. When Roach advertised the film in late 1939 with Griffith listed as producer, Griffith asked that his name be removed.\nGriffith was for decades held in awe by many members of the film industry. He was presented with an honorary Oscar by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1936. In 1946, he made an impromptu visit to the film location of David O. Selznick's epic western \"Duel in the Sun\", where some of his veteran actors\u2014Lillian Gish, Lionel Barrymore and Harry Carey\u2014were cast members. Gish and Barrymore found their mentor's presence distracting, and they became self-conscious; in response, Griffith hid behind the scenery when the two were filming their scenes.\nDeath.\nOn the morning of July 23, 1948, Griffith was discovered unconscious in the lobby at the Knickerbocker Hotel in Los Angeles, where he had been living alone. He died of a cerebral hemorrhage on the way to a Hollywood hospital. A public memorial service was held in his honor at the Hollywood Masonic Temple. He is buried at Mount Tabor Methodist Church Graveyard in Centerfield, Kentucky. In 1950, The Directors Guild of America provided a stone and bronze monument for his grave site.\nLegacy.\nGriffith has a controversial legacy. Despite criticism, he was a widely celebrated and respected public figure during his life, and modern film historians continue to recognize him for his contributions to the craft of filmmaking. Nevertheless, many critics during his lifetime, as well as in the decades since his death, have characterized him and his work (most notably \"The Birth of a Nation\") as upholding white supremacist ideals. Historians frequently cite \"The Birth of a Nation\" as a major factor in the KKK's revival in the 20th century, and it remains controversial to this day.\nPerformer and director Charlie Chaplin called Griffith \"The Teacher of Us All\". Filmmakers such as Alfred Hitchcock, Lev Kuleshov, Jean Renoir, Cecil B. DeMille, King Vidor, Victor Fleming, Raoul Walsh, Carl Theodor Dreyer, and Stanley Kubrick have praised Griffith. Sergei Eisenstein expressed his admiration for Griffith as an \"outstanding master\", but criticized \"Birth of a Nation\", calling it \"disgraceful propaganda of racial hatred towards the colored people\".\nGriffith seems to have been of the first to understand how certain film techniques could be used to create an expressive language; it gained popular recognition with the release of his \"The Birth of a Nation\" (1915). His early shorts \u2014such as Biograph's \"The Musketeers of Pig Alley\" (1912), show that Griffith's attention to camera placement and lighting heightened mood and tension. In making \"Intolerance\", Griffith opened new possibilities for the medium, creating a form that seems to owe more to music than to traditional narrative.\nFilm preservation.\nGriffith has six films preserved on the United States National Film Registry deemed as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\": \"Lady Helen's Escapade\", \"A Corner in Wheat\" (both 1909), \"The Musketeers of Pig Alley\" (1912), \"The Birth of a Nation\" (1915), \"Intolerance\" (1916) and \"Broken Blossoms\" (1919)."}

{"id": "7890", "revid": "28979433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7890", "title": "Dune", "text": "A dune is a landform composed of wind- or water-driven sand. It typically takes the form of a mound, ridge, or hill. An area with dunes is called a dune system or a dune complex. A large dune complex is called a dune field, while broad, flat regions covered with wind-swept sand or dunes, with little or no vegetation, are called \"ergs\" or \"sand seas\". Dunes occur in different shapes and sizes, but most kinds of dunes are longer on the stoss (upflow) side, where the sand is pushed up the dune, and have a shorter \"slip face\" in the lee side. The valley or trough between dunes is called a \"dune slack\".\nDunes are most common in desert environments, where the lack of moisture hinders the growth of vegetation that would otherwise interfere with the development of dunes. However, sand deposits are not restricted to deserts, and dunes are also found along sea shores, along streams in semiarid climates, in areas of glacial outwash, and in other areas where poorly cemented sandstone bedrock disintegrates to produce an ample supply of loose sand. Subaqueous dunes can form from the action of water flow (fluvial processes) on sand or gravel beds of rivers, estuaries, and the sea-bed.\nSome coastal areas have one or more sets of dunes running parallel to the shoreline directly inland from the beach. In most cases, the dunes are important in protecting the land against potential ravages by storm waves from the sea. Artificial dunes are sometimes constructed to protect coastal areas. The dynamic action of wind and water can sometimes cause dunes to drift, which can have serious consequences. For example, the town of Eucla, Western Australia, had to be relocated in the 1890s because of dune drift.\nThe modern word \"dune\" came into English from French around 1790, which in turn came from Middle Dutch \"d\u016bne\".\nFormation.\nA universally precise distinction does not exist between ripples, dunes, and draas, which are all deposits of the same type of materials. Dunes are generally defined as greater than 7\u00a0cm tall and may have ripples, while ripples are deposits that are less than 3\u00a0cm tall. A draa is a very large aeolian landform, with a length of several kilometers and a height of tens to hundreds of meters, and which may have superimposed dunes.\nDunes are made of sand-sized particles, and may consist of quartz, calcium carbonate, snow, gypsum, or other materials. The upwind/upstream/upcurrent side of the dune is called the stoss side; the downflow side is called the lee side. Sand is pushed (creep) or bounces (saltation) up the stoss side, and slides down the lee side. A side of a dune that the sand has slid down is called a slip face (or slipface).\nThe Bagnold formula gives the speed at which particles can be transported.\nAeolian dunes.\nAeolian dune shapes.\nFive basic dune types are recognized: crescentic, linear, star, dome, and parabolic. Dune areas may occur in three forms: simple (isolated dunes of basic type), compound (larger dunes on which smaller dunes of same type form), and complex (combinations of different types).\nBarchan or crescentic.\nBarchan dunes are crescent-shaped mounds which are generally wider than they are long. The lee-side slipfaces are on the concave sides of the dunes. These dunes form under winds that blow consistently from one direction (unimodal\nwinds). They form separate crescents when the sand supply is comparatively small. When the sand supply is greater, they may merge into barchanoid ridges, and then transverse dunes (see below).\nSome types of crescentic dunes move more quickly over desert surfaces than any other type of dune. A group of dunes moved more than 100 metres per year between 1954 and 1959 in China's Ningxia Province, and similar speeds have been recorded in the Western Desert of Egypt. The largest crescentic dunes on Earth, with mean crest-to-crest widths of more than three kilometres, are in China's Taklamakan Desert.\nTransverse dunes.\nAbundant barchan dunes may merge into barchanoid ridges, which then grade into linear (or slightly sinuous) transverse dunes, so called because they lie transverse, or across, the wind direction, with the wind blowing perpendicular to the ridge crest.\nSeif or longitudinal dunes.\nSeif dunes are linear (or slightly sinuous) dunes with two slip faces. The dunes lie generally parallel to each other The two slip faces make them sharp-crested. They are called \"seif\" dunes after the Arabic word for \"sword\". They may be more than 160 kilometres (100 miles) long, and thus easily visible in satellite images (see illustrations).\nSeif dunes are associated with bidirectional winds. The long axes and ridges of these dunes extend along the resultant direction of sand movement (hence the name \"longitudinal\"). Some linear dunes merge to form Y-shaped compound dunes.\nFormation is debated. Ralph Bagnold, in \"The Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes\", suggested that some seif dunes form when a barchan dune moves into a bidirectional wind regime, and one arm or wing of the crescent elongates. Others suggest that seif dunes are formed by vortices in a unidirectional wind. In the sheltered troughs between highly developed seif dunes, barchans may be formed, because the wind is constrained to be unidirectional by the dunes.\nSeif dunes are common in the Sahara. They range up to in height and in length. In the southern third of the Arabian Peninsula, a vast erg, called the Rub' al Khali or Empty Quarter, contains seif dunes that stretch for almost and reach heights of over .\nLinear loess hills known as pahas are superficially similar. These hills appear to have been formed during the last ice age under permafrost conditions dominated by sparse tundra vegetation.\nStar.\nStar dunes are pyramidal sand mounds with slipfaces on three or more arms that radiate from the high center of the mound. They tend to accumulate in areas with multidirectional wind regimes. Star dunes grow upward rather than laterally. They dominate the Grand Erg Oriental of the Sahara. In other deserts, they occur around the margins of the sand seas, particularly near topographic barriers. In the southeast Badain Jaran Desert of China, the star dunes are up to 500 metres tall and may be the tallest dunes on Earth.\nDome.\nOval or circular mounds that generally lack a slipface. Dome dunes are rare and occur at the far upwind margins of sand seas.\nLunettes.\nFixed crescentic dunes that form on the leeward margins of playas and river valleys in arid and semiarid regions in response to the direction (s) of prevailing winds, are known as lunettes, source-bordering dunes, bourrelets and clay dunes. They may be composed of clay, silt, sand, or gypsum, eroded from the basin floor or shore, transported up the concave side of the dune, and deposited on the convex side. Examples in Australia are up to 6.5\u00a0km long, 1\u00a0km wide, and up to 50 metres high. They also occur in southern and West Africa, and in parts of the western United States, especially Texas.\nParabolic.\nU-shaped mounds of sand with convex noses trailed by elongated arms are parabolic dunes. These dunes are formed from blowout dunes where the erosion of vegetated sand leads to a U-shaped depression. The elongated arms are held in place by vegetation; the largest arm known on Earth reaches 12\u00a0km. Sometimes these dunes are called U-shaped, blowout, or hairpin dunes, and they are well known in coastal deserts. Unlike crescent shaped dunes, their crests point upwind. The bulk of the sand in the dune migrates forward.\nIn plan view, these are U-shaped or V-shaped mounds of well-sorted, very fine to medium sand with elongated arms that extend upwind behind the central part of the dune. There are slipfaces that often occur on the outer side of the nose and on the outer slopes of the arms.\nThese dunes often occur in semiarid areas where the precipitation is retained in the lower parts of the dune and underlying soils. The stability of the dunes was once attributed to the vegetative cover but recent research has pointed to water as the main source of parabolic dune stability. The vegetation that covers them\u2014grasses, shrubs, and trees\u2014help anchor the trailing arms. In inland deserts, parabolic dunes commonly originate and extend downwind from blowouts in sand sheets only partly anchored by vegetation. They can also originate from beach sands and extend inland into vegetated areas in coastal zones and on shores of large lakes.\nMost parabolic dunes do not reach heights higher than a few tens of metres except at their nose, where vegetation stops or slows the advance of accumulating sand.\nSimple parabolic dunes have only one set of arms that trail upwind, behind the leading nose. Compound parabolic dunes are coalesced features with several sets of trailing arms. Complex parabolic dunes include subsidiary superposed or coalesced forms, usually of barchanoid or linear shapes.\nParabolic dunes, like crescent dunes, occur in areas where very strong winds are mostly unidirectional. Although these dunes are found in areas now characterized by variable wind speeds, the effective winds associated with the growth and migration of both the parabolic and crescent dunes probably are the most consistent in wind direction.\nThe grain size for these well-sorted, very fine to medium sands is about 0.06 to 0.5\u00a0mm. Parabolic dunes have loose sand and steep slopes only on their outer flanks. The inner slopes are mostly well packed and anchored by vegetation, as are the corridors between individual dunes. Because all dune arms are oriented in the same direction, and, the inter-dune corridors are generally swept clear of loose sand, the corridors can usually be traversed in between the trailing arms of the dune. However to cross straight over the dune by going over the trailing arms, can be very difficult. Also, traversing the nose is very difficult as well because the nose is usually made up of loose sand without much if any vegetation.\nA type of extensive parabolic dune that lacks discernible slipfaces and has mostly coarse grained sand is known as a \"zibar\". The term zibar comes from the Arabic word to describe \"rolling transverse ridges ... with a hard surface\". The dunes are small, have low relief, and can be found in many places across the planet from Wyoming (United States) to Saudi Arabia to Australia. Spacing between zibars ranges from 50 to 400 metres and they do not become more than 10 metres high. The dunes form at about ninety degrees to the prevailing wind which blows away the small, fine-grained sand leaving behind the coarser grained sand to form the crest.\nReversing dunes.\nOccurring wherever winds periodically reverse direction, reversing dunes are varieties of any of the above shapes. These dunes typically have major and minor slipfaces oriented in opposite directions. The minor slipfaces are usually temporary, as they appear after a reverse wind and are generally destroyed when the wind next blows in the dominant direction.\nDraas.\nDraas are very large-scale dune bedforms; they may be tens or a few hundreds of metres in height, kilometres wide, and hundreds of kilometres in length. After a draa has reached a certain size, it generally develops superimposed dune forms. They are thought to be more ancient and slower-moving than smaller dunes, and to form by vertical growth of existing dunes. Draas are widespread in sand seas and are well-represented in the geological record.\nDune complexity.\nAll these dune shapes may occur in three forms: simple (isolated dunes of basic type), compound (larger dunes on which smaller dunes of same type form), and complex (combinations of different types). Simple dunes are basic forms with the minimum number of slipfaces that define the geometric type. Compound dunes are large dunes on which smaller dunes of similar type and slipface orientation are superimposed. Complex dunes are combinations of two or more dune types. A crescentic dune with a star dune superimposed on its crest is the most common complex dune. Simple dunes represent a wind regime that has not changed in intensity or direction since the formation of the dune, while compound and complex dunes suggest that the intensity and direction of the wind has changed.\nDune movement.\nThe sand mass of dunes can move either windward or leeward, depending on if the wind is making contact with the dune from below or above its apogee. If wind hits from above, the sand particles move leeward; the leeward flux of sand is greater than the windward flux. Conversely, if sand hits from below, sand particles move windward. Further, if the wind is carrying sand particles when it hits the dune, the dune's sand particles will saltate more than if the wind had hit the dune without carrying sand particles.\nCoastal dunes.\nCoastal dunes form when wet sand is deposited along the coast and dries out and is blown along the beach. Dunes form where the beach is wide enough to allow for the accumulation of wind-blown sand, and where prevailing onshore winds tend to blow sand inland. The three key ingredients for coastal dune formation are a large sand supply, winds to move said sand supply, and a place for the sand supply to accumulate. Obstacles\u2014for example, vegetation, pebbles and so on\u2014tend to slow down the wind and lead to the deposition of sand grains. These small \"incipient dunes or \"shadow dunes\" tend to grow in the vertical direction if the obstacle slowing the wind can also grow vertically (i.e., vegetation). Coastal dunes expand laterally as a result of lateral growth of coastal plants via seed or rhizome. Models of coastal dunes suggest that their final equilibrium height is related to the distance between the water line and where vegetation can grow. Coastal dunes can be classified by where they develop, or begin to take shape. Dunes are commonly grouped into either the Primary Dune Group or the Secondary Dune Group. Primary dunes gain most of their sand from the beach itself, while secondary dunes gain their sand from the primary dune. Along the Florida Panhandle, most dunes are considered to be foredunes or hummocks. Different locations around the globe have dune formations unique to their given coastal profile.\nCoastal sand dunes can provide privacy and/or habitats to support local flora and fauna. Animals such as sand snakes, lizards, and rodents can live in coastal sand dunes, along with insects of all types. Often the vegetation of sand dunes is discussed without acknowledging the importance that coastal dunes have for animals. Further, some animals, such as foxes and feral pigs can use coastal dunes as hunting grounds to find food. Birds are also known to utilize coastal dunes as nesting grounds. All these species find the coastal environment of the sand dune vital to their species' survival.\nOver the course of time coastal dunes may be impacted by tropical cyclones or other intense storm activity, dependent on their location. Recent work has suggested that coastal dunes tend to evolve toward a high or low morphology depending on the growth rate of dunes relative to storm frequency. During a storm event, dunes play a significant role in minimizing wave energy as it moves onshore. As a result, coastal dunes, especially those in the foredune area affected by a storm surge, will retreat or erode. To counteract the damage from tropical activity on coastal dunes, short term post-storm efforts can be made by individual agencies through fencing to help with sand accumulation.\nHow much a dune erodes during any storm surge is related to its location on the coastal shoreline and the profile of the beach during a particular season. In those areas with harsher winter weather, during the summer a beach tends to take on more of a convex appearance due to gentler waves, while the same beach in the winter may take on more of a concave appearance. As a result, coastal dunes can get eroded much more quickly in the winter than in the summer. The converse is true in areas with harsher summer weather.\nThere are many threats to these coastal communities. Some coastal dunes, for example ones in San Francisco, have been completely altered by urbanization; reshaping the dune for human use. This puts native species at risk. Another danger, in California and places in the UK specifically, is the introduction of invasive species. Plant species, such as \"Carpobrotus edulis\", were introduced from South Africa in an attempt to stabilize the dunes and provide horticultural benefits, but instead spread taking land away from native species. \"Ammophila arenaria\", known as European beachgrass, has a similar story, though it has no horticulture benefits. It has great ground coverage and, as intended, stabilized the dunes but as an unintended side effect prevented native species from thriving in those dunes. One such example is the dune field at Point Reyes, California. There are now efforts to get rid of both of these invasive species.\nEcological succession on coastal dunes.\nAs a dune forms, plant succession occurs. The conditions on an \"embryo dune\" are harsh, with salt spray from the sea carried on strong winds. The dune is well drained and often dry, and composed of calcium carbonate from seashells. Rotting seaweed, brought in by storm waves adds nutrients to allow pioneer species to colonize the dune. For example, in the United Kingdom these pioneer species are often marram grass, sea wort grass and other sea grasses. These plants are well adapted to the harsh conditions of the foredune, typically having deep roots which reach the water table, root nodules that produce nitrogen compounds, and protected stoma, reducing transpiration. Also, the deep roots bind the sand together, and the dune grows into a foredune as more sand is blown over the grasses. The grasses add nitrogen to the soil, meaning other, less hardy plants can then colonize the dunes. Typically these are heather, heaths and gorses. These too are adapted to the low soil water content and have small, prickly leaves which reduce transpiration. Heather adds humus to the soil and is usually replaced by coniferous trees, which can tolerate low soil pH, caused by the accumulation and decomposition of organic matter with nitrate leaching. Coniferous forests and heathland are common climax communities for sand dune systems.\nYoung dunes are called yellow dunes and dunes which have high humus content are called grey dunes. Leaching occurs on the dunes, washing humus into the slacks, and the slacks may be much more developed than the exposed tops of the dunes. It is usually in the slacks that more rare species are developed and there is a tendency for the dune slacks' soil to be waterlogged where only marsh plants can survive. In Europe these plants include: creeping willow, cotton grass, yellow iris, reeds, and rushes. As for vertebrates in European dunes, natterjack toads sometimes breed here.\nCoastal dune floral adaptations.\nDune ecosystems are extremely difficult places for plants to survive. This is due to a number of pressures related to their proximity to the ocean and confinement to growth on sandy substrates. These include:\nPlants have evolved many adaptations to cope with these pressures:\nGypsum dunes.\nIn deserts where large amounts of limestone mountains surround a closed basin, such as at White Sands National Park in south-central New Mexico, occasional storm runoff transports dissolved limestone and gypsum into a low-lying pan within the basin where the water evaporates, depositing the gypsum and forming crystals known as selenite. The crystals left behind by this process are eroded by the wind and deposited as vast white dune fields that resemble snow-covered landscapes. These types of dune are rare, and only form in closed arid basins that retain the highly soluble gypsum that would otherwise be washed into the sea.\nNabkha dunes.\nA nabkha, or coppice dune, is a small dune anchored by vegetation. They usually indicate desertification or soil erosion, and serve as nesting and burrow sites for animals.\nSub-aqueous dunes.\nSub-aqueous (underwater) dunes form on a bed of sand or gravel under the actions of water flow. They are ubiquitous in natural channels such as rivers and estuaries, and also form in engineered canals and pipelines. Dunes move downstream as the upstream slope is eroded and the sediment deposited on the downstream or lee slope in typical bedform construction. In the case of sub-aqueous barchan dunes, sediment is lost by their extremities, known as horns.\nThese dunes most often form as a continuous 'train' of dunes, showing remarkable similarity in wavelength and height. The shape of a dune gives information about its formation environment. For instance, rivers produce asymmetrical ripples, with the steeper slip face facing downstream. Ripple marks preserved in sedimentary strata in the geological record can be used to determine the direction of current flow, and thus an indication of the source of the sediments.\nDunes on the bed of a channel significantly increase flow resistance, their presence and growth playing a major part in river flooding.\nLithified dunes.\nA lithified (consolidated) sand dune is a type of sandstone that is formed when a marine or aeolian sand dune becomes compacted and hardened. Once in this form, water passing through the rock can carry and deposit minerals, which can alter the colour of the rock. Cross-bedded layers of stacks of lithified dunes can produce the cross-hatching patterns, such as those seen in Zion National Park in the western United States.\nA slang term, used in the southwest US, for consolidated and hardened sand dunes is \"slickrock\", a name that was introduced by pioneers of the Old West because their steel-rimmed wagon wheels could not gain traction on the rock.\nDesertification.\nSand dunes can have a negative impact on humans when they encroach on human habitats. Sand dunes move via a few different means, all of them helped along by wind. One way that dunes can move is by saltation, where sand particles skip along the ground like a bouncing ball. When these skipping particles land, they may knock into other particles and cause them to move as well, in a process known as creep. With slightly stronger winds, particles collide in mid-air, causing sheet flows. In a major dust storm, dunes may move tens of metres through such sheet flows. Also as in the case of snow, sand avalanches, falling down the slipface of the dunes\u2014that face away from the winds\u2014also move the dunes forward.\nSand threatens buildings and crops in Africa, the Middle East, and China. Drenching sand dunes with oil stops their migration, but this approach uses a valuable resource and is quite destructive to the dunes' animal habitats. Sand fences might also slow their movement to a crawl, but geologists are still analyzing results for the optimum fence designs. Preventing sand dunes from overwhelming towns, villages, and agricultural areas has become a priority for the United Nations Environment Programme. Planting dunes with vegetation also helps to stabilise them.\nConservation.\nDune habitats provide niches for highly specialized plants and animals, including numerous rare species and some endangered species. Due to widespread human population expansion, dunes face destruction through land development and recreational usages, as well as alteration to prevent the encroachment of sand onto inhabited areas. Some countries, notably the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Sri Lanka have developed significant programs of dune protection through the use of sand dune stabilization. In the U.K., a Biodiversity Action Plan has been developed to assess dunes loss and to prevent future dunes destruction.\nExamples.\nExtraterrestrial dunes.\nDunes can likely be found in any environment where there is a substantial atmosphere, winds, and dust to be blown. Dunes are common on Mars and in the equatorial regions of Titan.\nTitan's dunes include large expanses with modal lengths of about 20\u201330\u00a0km. The regions are not topographically confined, resembling sand seas. These dunes are interpreted to be longitudinal dunes whose crests are oriented parallel to the dominant wind direction, which generally indicates west-to-east wind flow. The sand is likely composed of hydrocarbon particles, possibly with some water ice mixed in.\nDunes are a popular theme in science fiction, featuring in depictions of dry Desert planets appearing as early as the 1956 film \"Forbidden Planet\" and Frank Herbert's 1965 novel \"Dune\". The environment of the desert planet Arrakis (also known as Dune) in the \"Dune\" franchise \"Dune\" in turn inspired the \"Star Wars\" franchise, which includes prominent theme of dunes on fictional planets such as Tatooine, Geonosis, and Jakku."}

Widely considered one of the most important filmmakers in the history of cinema, Lynch was often called a \"visionary\" and was acclaimed for films often distinguished by their surrealist and experimental qualities. In a career spanning more than five decades, he received numerous accolades, including the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement at the Venice Film Festival in 2006 and an Honorary Academy Award in 2019. The adjective came into use to describe works or situations reminiscent of his art, including his penchant for \"juxtaposing surreal or sinister elements with mundane, everyday environments, and for using compelling visual images to emphasize a dreamlike quality of mystery or menace\".\nLynch studied painting and made short films before making his first feature-length film, the independent body horror film \"Eraserhead\" (1977), which found success as a midnight movie. He then earned critical acclaim as well as nominations for the Academy Award for Best Director for the biographical drama \"The Elephant Man\" (1980), the mystery thriller \"Blue Velvet\" (1986), and the psychological drama \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001). For his romantic crime drama \"Wild at Heart\" (1990), he received the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. He also directed the space opera \"Dune\" (1984), the neo-noir \"Lost Highway\" (1997), the road movie \"The Straight Story\" (1999), and the experimental thriller \"Inland Empire\" (2006).\nLynch and Mark Frost created the ABC series \"Twin Peaks\" (1990\u201391), for which he received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series and Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. Lynch co-wrote and directed its film prequel, \"\" (1992) and a third season in 2017. His acting career included roles in \"Twin Peaks\" and in the films \"Lucky\" (2017) and \"The Fabelmans\" (2022). He also guest-starred in TV series such as \"The Cleveland Show\" (2010\u201313) and \"Louie\" (2012). He directed music videos for artists such as X Japan, Moby, Interpol, Nine Inch Nails and Donovan, and commercials for Dior, YSL, Gucci and the New York City Department of Sanitation. \nLynch also worked as a musician, releasing solo albums and a variety of collaborations; a visual artist, including painting, furniture design, and photography; and an author, publishing the books \"Images\" (1994), \"Catching the Big Fish\" (2006) and \"Room to Dream\" (2018). A practitioner of Transcendental Meditation, he founded the David Lynch Foundation to fund meditation lessons for at-risk populations. A lifelong smoker, he died from complications of emphysema after being evacuated from his home due to the 2025 Southern California wildfires.\nEarly life and education.\nDavid Keith Lynch was born in Missoula, Montana, on January 20, 1946. The first film he saw was Henry King's \"Wait till the Sun Shines, Nellie\" (1952). His father, Donald Walton Lynch (1915\u20132007), was a research scientist working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and his mother, Edwina \"Sunny\" Lynch (n\u00e9e Sundholm; 1919\u20132004), was an English language tutor. Two of Lynch's maternal great-grandparents were Finnish-Swedish immigrants who arrived in the U.S. during the 19th century. He recalled that his father \"would drive me through the woods in his green Forest Service truck, over dirt roads, through the most beautiful forests where the trees are very tall and shafts of sunlight come down and in the mountain streams the rainbow trout leap out and their little trout sides catch glimpses of light. Then my father would drop me in the woods and go off. It was a weird, comforting feeling being in the woods.\" He was raised as a Presbyterian. The Lynches often moved around according to where the USDA assigned Donald: Lynch moved with his parents to Sandpoint, Idaho, when he was two months old; two years later, after his brother John was born, the family moved to Spokane, Washington. Lynch's sister Martha was born there. The family then moved to Durham, North Carolina, Boise, Idaho, and Alexandria, Virginia. Lynch adjusted to this transitory early life with relative ease, noting that he usually had no issue making new friends whenever he started attending a new school. Of his early life, he remarked:\nAlongside his schooling, Lynch joined the Boy Scouts. Later, he said he \"became [a Scout] so I could quit and put it behind me\". He rose to the highest rank of Eagle Scout, and was present with other Boy Scouts outside the White House at the inauguration of President John F. Kennedy, which took place on Lynch's 15th birthday. Lynch befriended Toby Keeler, whose father, Bushnell, was a painter. Bushnell gave Lynch \"The Art Spirit\" by Robert Henri. It was a revelation, and Lynch decided to dedicate himself to \"the art life\".\nAt Francis C. Hammond High School in Alexandria, Lynch did not excel academically, having little interest in schoolwork, but he was popular with other students, and after leaving he decided that he wanted to study painting at college. He began his studies at the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design in Washington, D.C., before transferring in 1964 to the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston with roommate musician Peter Wolf. He left after only a year, saying, \"I was not inspired AT ALL in that place.\" He instead decided that he wanted to travel around Europe for three years with his friend Jack Fisk, who was similarly unhappy with his studies at Cooper Union. They had some hopes that they could train in Europe with Austrian expressionist painter Oskar Kokoschka at his school. Upon reaching Salzburg, however, they found that Kokoschka was not available. Disillusioned, they returned to the United States after spending only two weeks in Europe.\nCareer.\n1967\u20131976: Short films and \"Eraserhead\".\nBack in the United States, Lynch returned to Virginia. Because his parents had moved to Walnut Creek, California, he stayed with his friend Toby Keeler for a while. He decided to move to Philadelphia and enroll at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, after advice from Fisk, who was already enrolled there. He preferred this college to his previous school in Boston, saying, \"In Philadelphia there were great and serious painters, and everybody was inspiring one another and it was a beautiful time there.\" He recalled that Philadelphia had \"a great mood\u2014factories, smoke, railroads, diners, the strangest characters and the darkest night. I saw vivid images\u2014plastic curtains held together with Band-Aids, rags stuffed in broken windows.\" He was influenced by the painterFrancis Bacon. In Philadelphia, Lynch began a relationship with a fellow student, Peggy Reavey, whom he married in 1967. The next year, their daughter Jennifer was born. Peggy later said Lynch \"definitely was a reluctant father, but a very loving one. Hey, I was pregnant when we got married. We were both reluctant.\" As a family, they moved to Philadelphia's Fairmount neighborhood, where they bought a 12-room house for the relatively low price of $3,500 () due to the area's high crime and poverty rates. Lynch later said:\nMeanwhile, to help support his family, Lynch took a job printing engravings. At the Pennsylvania Academy, Lynch made his first short film, \"Six Men Getting Sick (Six Times)\" (1967). He had first come up with the idea when he developed a wish to see his paintings move, and he began discussing doing animation with an artist named Bruce Samuelson. When this project never came about, Lynch decided to work on a film alone and purchased the cheapest 16mm camera that he could find. Taking one of the academy's abandoned upper rooms as a workspace, he spent $150, which at the time he felt to be a lot of money, to produce \"Six Men Getting Sick\". Calling the film \"57 seconds of growth and fire, and three seconds of vomit\", Lynch played it on a loop at the academy's annual end-of-year exhibit, where it shared joint-first prize with a painting by Noel Mahaffey. This led to a commission from one of his fellow students, the wealthy H. Barton Wasserman, who offered him $1,000 () to create a film installation in his home. Spending $478 of that on the second-hand Bolex camera \"of [his] dreams\", Lynch produced a new animated short but, upon getting the film developed, realized that the result was a blurred, frameless print. He later said, \"So I called up [Wasserman] and said, 'Bart, the film is a disaster. The camera was broken and what I've done hasn't turned out.' And he said, 'Don't worry, David, take the rest of the money and make something else for me. Just give me a print.' End of story.\"\nWith his leftover money, Lynch decided to experiment with a mix of animation and live action, producing the four-minute short \"The Alphabet\" (1968). The film starred Lynch's wife Peggy as a character known as The Girl, who sings the alphabet to a series of images of horses before dying at the end by hemorrhaging blood all over her bed sheets. Adding a sound effect, Lynch used a broken Uher tape recorder to record the sound of Jennifer crying, creating a distorted sound that Lynch found particularly effective. Later describing what had inspired him, Lynch said, \"Peggy's niece was having a bad dream one night and was saying the alphabet in her sleep in a tormented way. So that's sort of what started 'The Alphabet' going. The rest of it was just subconscious.\"\nLearning about the newly founded American Film Institute, which gave grants to filmmakers who could support their application with a prior work and a script for a new project, Lynch decided to submit a copy of \"The Alphabet\" along with a script he had written for a new short film, \"The Grandmother\", that would be almost entirely live action. The institute agreed to help finance the work, initially offering him $5,000 out of his requested budget of $7,200, but later granting him the additional $2,200. Starring people he knew from both work and college and filmed in his own house, \"The Grandmother\" featured a neglected boy who \"grows\" a grandmother from a seed to care for him. The film critics Michelle Le Blanc and Colin Odell wrote, \"this film is a true oddity but contains many of the themes and ideas that would filter into his later work, and shows a remarkable grasp of the medium\".\nLynch left the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts after three semesters and in 1970 moved with his wife and daughter to Los Angeles, where he began studying filmmaking at the AFI Conservatory, a place he later called \"completely chaotic and disorganized, which was great\u00a0... you quickly learned that if you were going to get something done, you would have to do it yourself. They wanted to let people do their thing.\" He began writing a script for a proposed work, \"Gardenback\", that had \"unfolded from this painting I'd done\". In this venture he was supported by a number of figures at the Conservatory, who encouraged him to lengthen the script and add more dialogue, which he reluctantly agreed to do. All the interference on his \"Gardenback\" project made him fed up with the Conservatory and led him to quit after returning to start his second year and being put in first-year classes. AFI dean Frank Daniel asked Lynch to reconsider, believing that he was one of the school's best students. Lynch agreed on the condition that he could create a project that would not be interfered with. Feeling that \"Gardenback\" was \"wrecked\", he set out on a new film, \"Eraserhead\".\n\"Eraserhead\" was planned to be about 42 minutes long (it ended up being 89 minutes), its script was only 21 pages, and Lynch was able to create the film without interference. He recalled its origin: \"My original image was of a man's head bouncing on the ground, being picked up by a boy and taken to a pencil factory. I don\u2019t know where it came from.\" Filming began on May 29, 1972, at night in some abandoned stables, allowing the production team (which was largely Lynch and some of his friends, including Sissy Spacek, Jack Fisk, cinematographer Frederick Elmes, and sound designer Alan Splet) to set up a camera room, green room, editing room, sets, as well as a food room and a bathroom. The AFI gave Lynch a $10,000 grant, but it was not enough to complete the film, and under pressure from studios after the success of the relatively cheap feature film \"Easy Rider\", it was unable to give him more. Lynch was then supported by a loan from his father and money that he earned from a paper route that he took up, delivering \"The Wall Street Journal\". Not long into \"Eraserhead\"s production, Lynch and Peggy amicably separated and divorced, and he began living full-time on set. In 1977, Lynch married Jack Fisk's sister Mary Fisk. In 1973, Lynch's sister suggested he try Transcendental Meditation. It proved a revelation, and Lynch claimed \"to never have missed a session since: twenty minutes, twice a day.\"\nLynch said that not a single reviewer of the film understood it as he intended. Filmed in black and white, \"Eraserhead\" tells the story of Henry (Jack Nance), a quiet young man, living in a dystopian industrial wasteland, whose girlfriend gives birth to a deformed baby whom she leaves in his care. It was heavily influenced by the fearful mood of Philadelphia, and Lynch has called it \"my \"Philadelphia Story\"\".\nDue to financial problems, the filming of \"Eraserhead\" was haphazard, regularly stopping and starting again. During one such break in 1974, Lynch made \"The Amputee\", a one-shot film about two minutes long. He proposed that he make \"The Amputee\" to present to AFI to test two different types of film stock.\n\"Eraserhead\" was finally finished in 1976. Lynch tried to get it entered into the Cannes Film Festival, but while some reviewers liked it, others felt it was awful, and it was not selected for screening. Reviewers from the New York Film Festival also rejected it, but it screened at the Los Angeles Film Festival, where Ben Barenholtz, the distributor of the Elgin Theater, heard about it. Barenholtz was very supportive of the movie, helping to distribute it around the United States in 1977. \"Eraserhead\" subsequently became popular on the midnight movie underground circuit, and was later called one of the most important midnight movies of the 1970s, along with \"Night of the Living Dead\", \"El Topo\", \"Pink Flamingos\", \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" and \"The Harder They Come\". Stanley Kubrick said it was one of his all-time favorite films.\n1980\u20131989: Populist surrealism.\nAfter \"Eraserhead\"s success on the underground circuit, Stuart Cornfeld, an executive producer for Mel Brooks, saw it and recalled, \"I was just 100 percent blown away\u00a0... I thought it was the greatest thing I'd ever seen. It was such a cleansing experience.\" He agreed to help Lynch with his next film, \"Ronnie Rocket\", for which Lynch had already written a script. But Lynch soon realized that \"Ronnie Rocket\", a film that he said is about \"electricity and a three-foot guy with red hair\", was not going to be picked up by any financiers, and so he asked Cornfeld to find him a script by someone else that he could direct. Cornfeld found four. On hearing the title of the first, \"The Elephant Man\", Lynch chose it. Brooks viewed \"Eraserhead\", and after coming out of the screening theater, embraced Lynch, declaring, \"You're a madman! I love you! You're in.\"\n\"The Elephant Man\"s script, by Chris de Vore and Eric Bergren, is based on the true story of Joseph Merrick, a severely deformed man in Victorian London, who was held in a sideshow but later taken under the care of a London surgeon, Frederick Treves. Lynch wanted to make some alterations that would deviate from real events but in his view make a better plot, but he needed the permission of Brooks, whose company, Brooksfilms, was responsible for production. The film stars John Hurt as John Merrick (the name changed from Joseph) and Anthony Hopkins as Treves. Filming took place in London. Though surrealistic and in black and white, it has been called \"one of the most conventional\" of Lynch's films. It was a critical and commercial success, earning eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay.\nAfter \"The Elephant Man\"s success, George Lucas, a fan of \"Eraserhead\", offered Lynch the opportunity to direct the third film in his original \"Star Wars\" trilogy, \"Return of the Jedi\". Lynch declined, saying that he had \"next door to zero interest\" and arguing that Lucas should direct the film himself as the movie should reflect his own vision, not Lynch's. Soon, the opportunity to direct another big-budget science fiction epic arose when Dino de Laurentiis of the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group asked Lynch to create a film adaptation of Frank Herbert's science fiction novel \"Dune\" (1965). Lynch agreed, and in doing so was also contractually obliged to produce two other works for the company. He began writing a script based on the novel, initially with both de Vore and Bergren, and then alone when De Laurentiis was unhappy with their ideas. Lynch also helped build some of the sets, attempting to create \"a certain look\", and particularly enjoyed building the set for the oil planet Giedi Prime, for which he used \"steel, bolts, and porcelain\".\n\"Dune\" is set in the far future, when humans live in an interstellar empire under a feudal system. The main character, Paul Atreides (Kyle MacLachlan), is the son of a nobleman who takes control of the desert planet Arrakis, which grows the rare spice melange, the empire's most highly prized commodity. Lynch was unhappy with the work, later saying: \"\"Dune\" was a kind of studio film. I didn't have final cut. And, little by little, I was subconsciously making compromises\". Much of his footage was removed from the final theatrical cut, dramatically condensing the plot. Although De Laurentiis hoped it would be as successful as \"Star Wars\", \"Dune\" (1984) was a critical and commercial dud; it had cost $45\u00a0million to make, and grossed $27.4\u00a0million domestically. Later, Universal Studios released an \"extended cut\" for syndicated television, containing almost an hour of cutting-room-floor footage and new narration. It did not represent Lynch's intentions, but the studio considered it more comprehensible than the original version. Lynch objected to the changes and had his name struck from the extended cut, which has Alan Smithee credited as the director and \"Judas Booth\" (a pseudonym Lynch invented, reflecting his feelings of betrayal) as the screenwriter.\nLynch was still contractually obligated to produce two other projects for De Laurentiis, the first a planned sequel to \"Dune\", which due to the film's failure never went beyond the script stage. The other was a more personal work, based on a script Lynch had been working on for some time. Developing from ideas that Lynch had had since 1973, \"Blue Velvet\" was set in Lumberton, North Carolina, and revolves around a college student, Jeffrey Beaumont (MacLachlan), who finds a severed ear in a field. Investigating with the help of his friend Sandy (Laura Dern), Jeffrey discovers a criminal gang led by psychopath Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), who has kidnapped the husband and child of singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) and repeatedly rapes her. Lynch called the story \"a dream of strange desires wrapped inside a mystery story\".\nLynch included 1960s pop songs in the film, including Roy Orbison's \"In Dreams\" and Bobby Vinton's \"Blue Velvet\", the latter of which largely inspired the film. Lynch said, \"It was the song that sparked the movie\u00a0... There was something mysterious about it. It made me think about things. And the first things I thought about were lawns\u2014lawns and the neighborhood.\" Other music for the film is by Angelo Badalamenti, who scored most of Lynch's subsequent work. De Laurentiis loved the film, and it received support at some of the early specialist screenings, but the preview screenings to mainstream audiences were very poorly received, with most viewers hating the film. Lynch had found success with \"The Elephant Man\", but the controversy over \"Blue Velvet\" among audiences and critics introduced him into the mainstream, and it became a huge critical and moderate commercial success. The film earned Lynch his second Academy Award nomination for Best Director. Pauline Kael wrote that \"Lynch might turn out to be the first populist surrealist - a Frank Capra of dream logic.\" She quoted a moviegoer as saying: \u201cMaybe I\u2019m sick, but I want to see that again.\u201d In the late 1980s, Lynch began to work in television, directing a short piece, \"The Cowboy and the Frenchman\", for French television in 1989.\n1990\u20131999: Czar of the bizarre.\nLynch met the television producer Mark Frost, who had worked on such projects as \"Hill Street Blues\", and they started working together on a biopic of Marilyn Monroe based on Anthony Summers' book \"The Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe\", but it never got off the ground. They went on to work on a comedy script, \"One Saliva Bubble\", but that did not see completion either. While talking in a coffee shop, Lynch and Frost had the idea of a corpse washing up on a lakeshore, and went to work on their third project, first called \"Northwest Passage\" and then \"Twin Peaks\" (1990\u201391). A drama series set in a small Washington town where popular high school student Laura Palmer has been murdered, \"Twin Peaks\" featured FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper (MacLachlan) as the investigator trying to identify the killer, and discovering not only the murder's supernatural aspects but also many of the townsfolk's secrets; Lynch said, \"The project was to mix a police investigation with the ordinary lives of the characters.\" He later said, \"[Mark Frost and I] worked together, especially in the initial stages. Later on we started working more apart.\" They pitched the series to ABC, which agreed to finance the pilot and eventually commissioned a season comprising seven episodes. Richard Corliss wrote: \"Long before the series' April premiere, ecstatic critics were priming TV viewers to expect the unexpected. Lynch's two-hour pilot didn't disappoint. It was frantic and lugubrious in turn, a soap opera with strychnine. In one night, the show had hip America hooked.\"\nLynch directed two of the first season's seven episodes and carefully chose the other episodes' directors. He also appeared in several episodes as FBI agent Gordon Cole. The series was a success, with high ratings in the U.S. and many other countries, and soon had a cult following. A second season of 22 episodes went into production, but ABC executives believed that public interest in the show was declining. The network insisted that Lynch and Frost reveal Laura's killer's identity prematurely, which Lynch grudgingly agreed to do, in what Lynch called one of his biggest professional regrets. After identifying the murderer and moving from Thursday to Saturday night, \"Twin Peaks\" continued for several more episodes, but was canceled after a ratings drop. Lynch, who disliked the direction that writers and directors took in the later episodes, directed the final episode. He ended it with a cliffhanger (like season one had), later saying, \"that's not the ending. That's the ending that people were stuck with.\"\nMeanwhile, he was also involved in creating various commercials for companies including Yves Saint Laurent, Calvin Klein, Giorgio Armani, and the Japanese coffee company Namoi, which featured a Japanese man searching Twin Peaks for his missing wife.\nWhile Lynch was working on the first few episodes of \"Twin Peaks\", his friend Monty Montgomery \"gave me a book that he wanted to direct as a movie. He asked if I would maybe be executive producer or something, and I said 'That's great, Monty, but what if I read it and fall in love with it and want to do it myself?' And he said, 'In that case, you can do it yourself'.\" The book was Barry Gifford's novel \"Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula\", about two lovers on a road trip. Lynch felt that it was \"just exactly the right thing at the right time. The book and the violence in America merged in my mind and many different things happened.\" With Gifford's support, Lynch adapted the novel into \"Wild at Heart\", a crime and road movie starring Nicolas Cage as Sailor and Laura Dern as Lula. Calling its plot a \"strange blend\" of \"a road picture, a love story, a psychological drama and a violent comedy\", Lynch departed substantially from the novel, changing the ending and incorporating numerous references to \"The Wizard of Oz\". Despite a muted response from American critics and viewers, \"Wild at Heart\" won the Palme d'Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. When it won the prize, audience members booed Lynch and the film. One of them was Roger Ebert, who admitted doing so on \"Late Show with David Letterman\".\nAfter \"Wild at Heart\"s success, Lynch returned to the world of the canceled \"Twin Peaks\", this time without Frost, to make a film that was primarily a prequel but also in part a sequel. Lynch said, \"I liked the idea of the story going back and forth in time.\" The result, \"\" (1992), primarily revolved around the last few days of Laura Palmer's life, was much \"darker\" in tone than the TV series, with much of the humor removed, and dealt with such topics as incest and murder. Lynch has said the film is about \"the loneliness, shame, guilt, confusion and devastation of the victim of incest\". The company CIBY-2000 financed \"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me\", and most of the TV series's cast reprised their roles, though some refused and many were unenthusiastic about the project. The film was a commercial failure in the U.S. at the time of its release, but has since experienced a critical reappraisal. Many critics, such as Mark Kermode, have called it Lynch's \"masterpiece\".\nMeanwhile, Lynch worked on some new television shows. He and Frost created the comedy series \"On the Air\" (1992), which was canceled after three episodes aired, and he and Montgomery created the three-episode HBO miniseries \"Hotel Room\" (1993) about events that happen in one hotel room on different dates.\nIn 1993, Lynch collaborated with Japanese musician Yoshiki on the video for X Japan's song \"Longing ~Setsubou no Yoru~\". The video was never officially released, but Lynch wrote in his 2018 memoir \"Room to Dream\" that \"some of the frames are so fuckin' beautiful, you can't believe it.\"\nAfter his unsuccessful TV ventures, Lynch returned to film. In 1997, he released the non-linear noiresque \"Lost Highway\", which was co-written by Barry Gifford and stars Bill Pullman and Patricia Arquette. The film failed commercially and received a mixed response from critics.\nLynch then began work on a film from a script by Mary Sweeney and John E. Roach, \"The Straight Story\", based on the true story of Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth), an elderly man from Laurens, Iowa, who goes on a 300-mile journey to visit his sick brother (Harry Dean Stanton) in Mount Zion, Wisconsin, by riding lawnmower. Asked why he chose this script, Lynch said, \"that's what I fell in love with next\", and expressed his admiration of Straight, describing him as \"like James Dean, except he's old\". Badalamenti wrote the music for the film, calling it \"very different from the kind of score he's done for [Lynch] in the past\".\nAmong the many differences from Lynch's other films, \"The Straight Story\" contains no profanity, sex, or violence, and is rated G (general viewing) by the Motion Picture Association of America, which came as \"shocking news\" to many in the film industry, who were surprised that it \"did not disturb, offend or mystify\". Le Blanc and Odell write that the plot made it \"seem as far removed from Lynch's earlier works as could be imagined, but in fact right from the very opening, this is entirely his film\u2014a surreal road movie\". It was also Lynch's only title released by Walt Disney Pictures in the U.S., after studio president Peter Schneider screened the film before its Cannes Film Festival premiere and quickly had Disney acquire the distribution rights. Schneider said it is \"a beautiful movie about values, forgiveness and healing and celebrates America. As soon as I saw it, I knew it was a Walt Disney film.\"\n2000\u20132009: \"Mulholland Drive\" and beyond.\nIn 1999, Lynch approached ABC again with ideas for a television drama. The network gave Lynch the go-ahead to shoot a two-hour pilot for the series \"Mulholland Drive\", but disputes over content and running time led to the project being shelved indefinitely. With $7 million from the French production company StudioCanal, Lynch completed the pilot as a film, \"Mulholland Drive\". The film, a nonlinear surrealist tale of Hollywood's dark side, stars Naomi Watts, Laura Harring, and Justin Theroux. It performed relatively well at the box office worldwide and was a critical success, earning Lynch Best Director at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival (shared with Joel Coen for \"The Man Who Wasn't There\") and Best Director from the New York Film Critics Association. He also received his third Academy Award nomination for Best Director. In 2016, the film was named the best film of the 21st century in a BBC poll of 177 film critics from 36 countries. Roger Ebert, who had dismissed much of Lynch's earlier work, wrote: \"At last his experiment doesn't shatter the test tubes. The movie is a surrealist dreamscape in the form of a Hollywood film noir, and the less sense it makes, the more we can't stop watching it.\"\nWith the rising popularity of the Internet, Lynch decided to use it as a distribution channel, releasing several new series he had created exclusively on his website, davidlynch.com, which went online on December 10, 2001. In 2002, he created a series of online shorts, \"DumbLand\". Intentionally crude in content and execution, the eight-episode series was later released on DVD. The same year, Lynch released a surreal sitcom, \"Rabbits\", about a family of humanoid rabbits. Later, he made his experiments with Digital Video available in the form of the Japanese-style horror short \"Darkened Room\". In 2006, Lynch's feature film \"Inland Empire\" was released. At three hours, it is his longest film. Like \"Mulholland Drive\" and \"Lost Highway\", it lacks a traditional narrative structure. It stars Laura Dern, Harry Dean Stanton, and Justin Theroux, with cameos by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring as the voices of Suzie and Jane Rabbit, and a performance by Jeremy Irons. Lynch called \"Inland Empire\" \"a mystery about a woman in trouble\". In an effort to promote it, he made appearances with a cow and a placard bearing the slogan \"Without cheese there would be no \"Inland Empire\"\".\nIn 2009, Lynch produced a documentary Web series directed by his son Austin Lynch and friend Jason S., \"Interview Project\". Interested in working with Werner Herzog, in 2009 Lynch collaborated on Herzog's film \"My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done\". With a nonstandard narrative, the film is based on a true story of an actor who committed matricide while acting in a production of the \"Oresteia\", and stars Grace Zabriskie. In 2009, Lynch had plans to direct a documentary on Maharishi Mahesh Yogi consisting of interviews with people who knew him, but nothing had come of it.\n2010\u20132019: Return to television.\nIn 2010, Lynch began making guest appearances on the \"Family Guy\" spin-off \"The Cleveland Show\" as Gus the Bartender. He had been convinced to appear in the show by its lead actor, Mike Henry, a fan of Lynch who felt that his life had changed after he saw \"Wild at Heart\". \"Lady Blue Shanghai\" is a 16-minute promotional film written, directed and edited by Lynch for Dior. It was released on the Internet in May 2010.\nLynch directed a concert by English new wave band Duran Duran on March 23, 2011. The concert was streamed live on YouTube from the Mayan Theater in Los Angeles as the kickoff to the second season of \"Unstaged: An Original Series from American Express\". \"The idea is to try and create on the fly, layers of images permeating Duran Duran on the stage\", Lynch said. \"A world of experimentation and hopefully some happy accidents\". The animated short \"I Touch a Red Button Man\", a collaboration between Lynch and the band Interpol, played in the background during Interpol's concert at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2011. The short, which features Interpol's song \"Lights\", was later made available online.\nIt was believed that Lynch was going to retire from the film industry; according to Abel Ferrara, Lynch \"doesn't even want to make films any more. I've talked to him about it, OK? I can tell when he talks about it.\" But in a June 2012 interview, Lynch said he lacked the inspiration to start a new movie project, but \"If I got an idea that I fell in love with, I'd go to work tomorrow\". In September 2012, he appeared in the three-part \"Late Show\" arc on FX's \"Louie\" as Jack Dahl. In November 2012, Lynch hinted at plans for a new film while attending Plus Camerimage in Bydgoszcz, Poland, saying, \"something is coming up. It will happen but I don't know exactly when\". At Plus Camerimage, Lynch received a lifetime achievement award and the Key to the City from Bydgoszcz's mayor, Rafa\u0142 Bruski. In a January 2013 interview, Laura Dern confirmed that she and Lynch were planning a new project, and \"The New York Times\" later reported that Lynch was working on the script. \"Idem Paris\", a short documentary film about the lithographic process, was released online in February 2013. On June 28, 2013, a video Lynch directed for the Nine Inch Nails song \"Came Back Haunted\" was released. He also did photography for the Dumb Numbers's self-titled album released in August 2013.\nOn October 6, 2014, Lynch confirmed via Twitter that he and Frost would start shooting a new, nine-episode season of \"Twin Peaks\" in 2015, with the episodes expected to air in 2016 on Showtime. Lynch and Frost wrote all the episodes. On April 5, 2015, Lynch announced via Twitter that the project was still alive, but he was no longer going to direct because the budget was too low for what he wanted to do. On May 15, 2015, he said via Twitter that he would return to the revival, having sorted out his issues with Showtime. Showtime CEO David Nevins confirmed this, announcing that Lynch would direct every episode of the revival and that the original nine episodes had been extended to 18. Filming was completed by April 2016. The two-episode premiere aired on May 21, 2017.\nWhile doing press for \"Twin Peaks\", Lynch was again asked if he had retired from film and seemed to confirm that he had made his last feature film, responding, \"Things changed a lot\u00a0... So many films were not doing well at the box office, even though they might have been great films and the things that were doing well at the box office weren't the things that I would want to do\". Lynch later said that this statement had been misconstrued: \"I did not say I quit cinema, simply that nobody knows what the future holds.\"\n2020\u20132025: Weather reports and final projects.\nLynch did weather reports on his now-defunct website in the 2000s. He returned to doing weather reports in 2020 from his apartment in Los Angeles, along with two new series, \"What is David Lynch Working on Today?\", which detailed him making collages, and \"Today's Number Is...\", in which he picked a random number from 1 to 10 each day from a jar containing ten numbered ping-pong balls. In one of his weather reports, Lynch detailed a dream he had about being a German soldier shot by an American soldier on D-Day. Most of his Weather Reports featured Lynch mentioning various songs. After his final weather report on December 16, 2022, Lynch said in an April 2023 interview that the series, along with \"What is David Lynch Working on Today?\" and \"Today's Number Is...\", would not return, adding: \"Now I can sleep longer in the morning. I had to get up very early to consult the real weather bulletin. In two years I have not missed a single one.\"\nIn June 2020, Lynch rereleased his 2002 web series \"Rabbits\" on YouTube. On July 17, 2020, his store for merchandise released a set of face masks with Lynch's art on them for the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2022, it was announced that Lynch had been cast in Steven Spielberg's film \"The Fabelmans\" in a role \"Variety\" called \"a closely guarded secret\", later revealed to be that of film director John Ford, whose encounter with Spielberg is dramatized in the film's final moments, with the film's protagonist Sammy Fabelman (played by Gabriel LaBelle) in Spielberg's place. Lynch and the cast were nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. \"The New York Times\" wrote: \"Mr. Lynch never made a conventional, crowd-pleasing Hollywood movie. But in 2022, he agreed to a cameo in one: Mr. Spielberg's autobiographical feature \"The Fabelmans\", where the enigmatic if not eldritch Mr. Lynch was cast as John Ford, the maker of westerns and the grand old curmudgeon of American cinema. It was a sentimental gesture that one can only call Lynchian.\"\nIn August 2024, Lynch made public that he had been diagnosed with emphysema, which he attributed to his years of smoking, and could no longer leave his house, meaning that he would only be able to direct remotely. He said a project for Netflix, with working titles \"Wisteria\" and \"Unrecorded Night\", had fallen through, but that he would like to see his unproduced projects \"Antelope Don't Run No More\" and \"Snootworld\" realized. Lynch said that month that he was working on existing projects as much as he could, and that he was in good health except for emphysema, and had no plans to retire. On January 16, 2025, Lynch's Facebook page reported that he had died, five days before his 79th birthday.\nStyle and influences.\nInfluences.\nLynch described his work as more similar to that of European filmmakers than American ones, and said that most films that \"get down and thrill your soul\" are by European directors. \nHe expressed his admiration for Federico Fellini, Ingmar Bergman, Werner Herzog, Alfred Hitchcock, Roman Polanski, Jacques Tati, Stanley Kubrick, and Billy Wilder. He said that Wilder's \"Sunset Boulevard\" (1950) was one of his favorite pictures, as were Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962), Fellini's \"8\u00bd\" (1963), Tati's \"Monsieur Hulot's Holiday\" (1953), Hitchcock's \"Rear Window\" (1954), and Herzog's \"Stroszek\" (1977). He also cited Herk Harvey's \"Carnival of Souls\" (1962) and Jerzy Skolimowski's \"Deep End\" (1970) as influences on his work. He regularly returned to Victor Fleming's \"The Wizard of Oz\"; the references he made to it are explored in Alexandre O. Philippe's documentary \"Lynch/Oz\" (2022).\nMotifs.\nSeveral themes recur in Lynch's work. Le Blanc and Odell write, \"his films are so packed with motifs, recurrent characters, images, compositions and techniques that you could view his entire output as one large jigsaw puzzle of ideas\". One of the key themes they note is the usage of dreams and dreamlike imagery and structure, something they relate to the \"surrealist ethos\" of relying \"on the subconscious to provide visual drive\". This can be seen in Merrick's dream of his mother in \"The Elephant Man\", Cooper's dreams of the red room in \"Twin Peaks\" and the \"dreamlike logic\" of the narratives of \"Eraserhead\", \"Mulholland Drive\", and \"Inland Empire\". Of his attitude to dreams, Lynch said: \"Waking dreams are the ones that are important, the ones that come when I'm quietly sitting in a chair, letting my mind wander. When you sleep, you don't control your dream. I like to dive into a dream world that I've made or discovered; a world I choose\u00a0... [You can't really get others to experience it, but] right there is the power of cinema.\" His films are known for their use of magic realism. The motif of dreams is closely linked to his recurring use of drones, real-world sounds and musical styles.\nAnother of Lynch's prominent themes is industry, with repeated imagery of \"the clunk of machinery, the power of pistons, shadows of oil drills pumping, screaming woodmills and smoke billowing factories\", as seen in the industrial wasteland in \"Eraserhead\", the factories in \"The Elephant Man\", the sawmill in \"Twin Peaks\", and the lawnmower in \"The Straight Story\". Of his interest in such things, Lynch said: \"It makes me feel good to see giant machinery, you know, working: dealing with molten metal. And I like fire and smoke. And the sounds are so powerful. It's just big stuff. It means that things are being made, and I really like that.\"\nAnother theme is the dark underbelly of violent criminal activity in a society, such as Frank Booth's gang in \"Blue Velvet\" and the cocaine smugglers in \"Twin Peaks\". The idea of deformity is also found in several of Lynch's films, from \"The Elephant Man\" to the deformed baby in \"Eraserhead\", as well as death from head wounds, found in most of his films. Other imagery common in Lynch's work includes flickering electricity or lights, fire, and stages upon which a singer performs, often surrounded by drapery.\nExcept \"The Elephant Man\" and \"Dune\", which are set in Victorian London and a fictitious galaxy respectively, all of Lynch's films are set in the United States. Lynch said: \"I like certain things about America and it gives me ideas. When I go around and I see things, it sparks little stories, or little characters pop out, so it just feels right to me to, you know, make American films.\" \"Blue Velvet\", \"Twin Peaks\", and \"Lost Highway\" are intentionally reminiscent of 1950s American culture despite being set in later decades. Lynch said, \"It was a fantastic decade in a lot of ways\u00a0... there was something in the air that is not there any more at all. It was such a great feeling, and not just because I was a kid. It was a really hopeful time, and things were going up instead of going down. You got the feeling you could do anything. The future was bright. Little did we know we were laying the groundwork for a disastrous future.\"\nLynch also tended to feature his leading female actors in \"split\" roles, so that many of his female characters have multiple, fractured identities. This practice began when he cast Sheryl Lee as both Laura Palmer and her cousin Maddy Ferguson in \"Twin Peaks\" and continued in his later works. In \"Lost Highway\", Patricia Arquette plays the dual role of Renee Madison/Alice Wakefield; in \"Mulholland Drive\" Naomi Watts plays Diane Selwyn/Betty Elms and Laura Harring plays Camilla Rhodes/Rita; in \"Inland Empire\" Laura Dern plays Nikki Grace/Susan Blue. The numerous alternate versions of lead characters and fragmented timelines may echo or reference the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics and perhaps Lynch's broader interest in quantum mechanics. Some have suggested that Lynch's love for Hitchcock's \"Vertigo\", which employs a split lead character (Judy Barton/Madeleine Elster, both portrayed by Kim Novak) may have influenced this aspect of his work.\nLynch's films often contain characters with supernatural or omnipotent qualities. They can be seen as physical manifestations of various concepts, such as hatred or fear. Examples include The Man Inside the Planet in \"Eraserhead\", BOB in \"Twin Peaks\", The Mystery Man in \"Lost Highway\", The Bum in \"Mulholland Drive\", and The Phantom in \"Inland Empire\". Lynch approached his characters and plots in a way that steeps them in a dream state rather than reality.\nRecurring collaborators.\nLynch was noted for his collaborations with various production artists and composers on his films and other productions. He frequently worked with composer Angelo Badalamenti, film editor Mary Sweeney, casting director Johanna Ray, and actors Harry Dean Stanton, Jack Nance, Kyle MacLachlan, Naomi Watts, Isabella Rossellini, Grace Zabriskie, and Laura Dern.\nOther work.\n\"The Angriest Dog in the World\".\nIn 1983, Lynch began writing and drawing a comic strip, \"The Angriest Dog in the World\", that featured unchanging graphics of a tethered dog so angry it could not move, alongside cryptic philosophical references. It was published from 1983 to 1992 in \"The Village Voice\", \"Creative Loafing\", and other tabloid and alternative publications. Around this time Lynch also became interested in photography and traveled to northern England to photograph its degrading industrial landscape.\n\"Industrial Symphony No. 1\".\nWhile \"Twin Peaks\" was in production, the Brooklyn Academy of Music asked Lynch and Angelo Badalamenti to create a theatrical piece to be performed twice in 1989 as a part of the New Music America Festival. The result was \"Industrial Symphony No.\u00a01: The Dream of the Broken Hearted\", which starred frequent Lynch collaborators Laura Dern, Nicolas Cage, and Michael J. Anderson and contained five songs sung by Julee Cruise. Lynch produced a 50-minute video of the performance in 1990. \nPainting.\nLynch first trained as a painter, and although better known as a filmmaker, continued to paint. He said: \"all my paintings are organic, violent comedies. They have to be violently done and primitive and crude, and to achieve that I try to let nature paint more than I paint.\" Many of his works are very dark in color; Lynch said this was because:\nMany of Lynch's paintings contain letters and words. He said:\nLynch was the subject of a major art retrospective at the Fondation Cartier in Paris from March 3 to May 27, 2007. The show was titled \"The Air is on Fire\" and included paintings, photographs, drawings, alternative films and sound work. New site-specific art installations were created specially for the exhibition. A series of events, including live performances and concerts, accompanied the exhibition. Lynch's alma mater, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, presented an exhibition of his work called \"The Unified Field\", which ran from September 12, 2014, to January 2015. Lynch was represented by Kayne Griffin Corcoran in Los Angeles, and began exhibiting his paintings, drawings, and photography with the gallery in 2011.\nLynch considered the 20th-century Irish-born British artist Francis Bacon his \"number one kinda hero painter\", saying, \"Normally I only like a couple of years of a painter's work, but I like everything of Bacon's. The guy, you know, had the stuff.\" His favorite photographers included William Eggleston (\"The Red Ceiling\"), Joel-Peter Witkin and Diane Arbus.\nMusic.\nLynch was involved in several music projects, many of them related to his films, including sound design for some of his films (sometimes alongside collaborators Alan Splet, Dean Hurley and Angelo Badalamenti). His album genres included experimental rock, ambient soundscapes and, most recently, avant-garde electropop music. He produced and wrote lyrics for Julee Cruise's first two albums, \"Floating into the Night\" (1989) and \"The Voice of Love\" (1993), in collaboration with Badalamenti, who composed the music and also produced. In 1991, Lynch directed a 30-second teaser trailer for Michael Jackson's album \"Dangerous\" at Jackson's request. Lynch also worked on the 1998 Jocelyn Montgomery album \"Lux Vivens (Living Light), The Music of Hildegard von Bingen\". He composed music for \"Wild at Heart\", \"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me\", \"Mulholland Drive\", and \"Rabbits\". In 2001, he released \"BlueBob\", a blues album performed by Lynch and John Neff. The album is notable for Lynch's unusual guitar playing style. He plays \"upside down and backwards, like a lap guitar\", and relies heavily on effects pedals. Lynch composed several pieces for \"Inland Empire\", including two songs, \"Ghost of Love\" and \"Walkin' on the Sky\", in which he made his public debut as a singer. In 2009, his book-CD set \"\" was released. In 2008, he started his own record label, David Lynch MC, which first released \"Fox Bat Strategy: A Tribute to Dave Jaurequi\" in early 2009.\nIn November 2010, Lynch released two electropop music singles, \"Good Day Today\" and \"I Know\", on the independent British label Sunday Best Recordings. Of the songs, he said, \"I was just sitting and these notes came and then I went down and started working with Dean [Hurley] and then these few notes, 'I want to have a good day, today' came and the song was built around that\". The singles were followed by an album, \"Crazy Clown Time\", which was released in November 2011 and described as an \"electronic blues album\". The songs were sung by Lynch, with guest vocals on one track by Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and composed and performed by Lynch and Hurley. All or most of the songs on \"Crazy Clown Time\" were put into art-music videos, with Lynch directing the title song's video.\nOn September 29, 2011, Lynch released \"This Train\" with vocalist and longtime musical collaborator Chrystabell on the La Rose Noire label. Lynch's third studio album, \"The Big Dream\", was released in 2013 and included the single \"I'm Waiting Here\", with Swedish singer-songwriter Lykke Li. \"The Big Dream\"s release was preceded by \"TBD716\", an enigmatic 43-second video featured on Lynch's YouTube and Vine accounts. For Record Store Day 2014, Lynch released \"The Big Dream Remix EP\", which featured four songs from his album remixed by various artists. This included the track \"Are You Sure\" remixed by the band Bastille. Bastille is known to have been inspired by Lynch's work for its songs and videos, especially the song \"Laura Palmer\".\nOn November 2, 2018, a collaborative album by Lynch and Badalamenti, \"Thought Gang\", was released on vinyl and compact disc. The album was recorded around 1993 but not released at the time. Two tracks from it appear on the soundtrack for \"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me\" and three others were used for \"Twin Peaks: The Return\". In May 2019, Lynch provided guest vocals on the track \"Fire is Coming\" by Flying Lotus. He also co-wrote the track that appears on Flying Lotus's album \"Flamagra\". A video accompanying the song was released on April 17, 2019. In May 2021, Lynch produced a track, \"I Am the Shaman\", by Scottish artist Donovan. The song was released on May 10, Donovan's 75th birthday. Lynch also directed the accompanying video.\nIn August 2024, Lynch released his final album, \"Cellophane Memories\", a collaboration between him and Chrystabell. Lynch also directed videos for two tracks on the album, \"Sublime Eternal Love\" and \"The Answers to the Questions\".\nDesign.\nLynch designed and constructed furniture for his 1997 film \"Lost Highway\", including the small table in the Madison house and the VCR case. In April 1997, he presented a furniture collection at the prestigious Milan Furniture Fair. \"Design and music, art and architecture \u2013 they all belong together.\"\nWorking with designer Raphael Navot, architectural agency Enia and light designer Thierry Dreyfus, Lynch has conceived and designed a nightclub in Paris. \"Silencio\" opened in October 2011, and is a private members' club although is free to the public after midnight. Patrons have access to concerts, films and other performances by artists and guests. Inspired by the club of the same name in his 2001 film \"Mulholland Drive\", the underground space consists of a series of rooms, each dedicated to a certain purpose or atmosphere. \"Silencio is something dear to me. I wanted to create an intimate space where all the arts could come together. There won't be a Warhol-like guru, but it will be open to celebrated artists of all disciplines to come here to programme or create what they want.\"\nLiterature.\nIn 2006, Lynch wrote a short book, \"Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity\", which describes his creative processes, stories from his career, and the benefits he has realized from his practice of Transcendental Meditation. He describes the metaphor behind the title in the introduction:\nThe book weaves a nonlinear autobiography with descriptions of Lynch's experiences during Transcendental Meditation.. Lynch also narrated it in an audiobook.\nWorking with Kristine McKenna, Lynch published a biography-memoir hybrid, \"Room to Dream\", in June 2018.\nAwards and nominations.\nLynch received multiple awards and nominations, including three Academy Award nominations for Best Director and one for Best Adapted Screenplay. He twice won France's C\u00e9sar Award for Best Foreign Film, as well as the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival. The French government awarded him the Legion of Honour, the country's top civilian distinction, honoring him first as a \"Chevalier\" in 2002 and then as an \"Officier\" in 2009; Lynch was also awarded the key to the city of Bydgoszcz, Poland. In 2017, The MacDowell Colony awarded Lynch The Edward MacDowell Medal for outstanding contributions to American culture.\nLegacy.\nLynch was often called a \"visionary\" over the course of his career. In 2007, a panel of critics convened by \"The Guardian\" announced that \"after all the discussion, no one could fault the conclusion that David Lynch is the most important film-maker of the current era\", and AllMovie called him \"the Renaissance man of modern American filmmaking\". Film critic Pauline Kael called Lynch \"the first populist surrealist\".\nThe moving image collection of David Lynch is held at the Academy Film Archive, which has preserved two of his student films.\nJ. Hoberman writes that \"Like Frank Capra and Franz Kafka, two widely disparate 20th-century artists whose work Mr. Lynch much admired and might be said to have synthesized, his name became an adjective.\" \"Lynchian\" has been used to describe art or situations reminiscent of Lynch's style. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" further defines Lynchian artwork as \"juxtaposing surreal or sinister elements with mundane, everyday environments, and for using compelling visual images to emphasize a dreamlike quality of mystery or menace.\" David Foster Wallace wrote, \"An academic definition of Lynchian might be that the term 'refers to a particular kind of irony where the very macabre and the very mundane combine in such a way as to reveal the former's perpetual containment within the latter'\" but that \"it's ultimately definable only ostensively\u2014\"i.e.\", we know it when we see it.\"\nPersonal life.\nRelationships.\nLynch had several long-term relationships. In January 1968, he married Peggy Reavey, with whom he had one child, Jennifer Lynch, born in 1968, who is a film director. They filed for divorce in 1974. In June 1977, Lynch married Mary Fisk, and the couple had one child, Austin Jack Lynch, born in 1982. They separated in 1985 and divorced in 1987. Lynch developed a relationship with actress Isabella Rossellini, with whom he lived between 1986 and 1991. In 1992, he and his editor Mary Sweeney had a son, Riley Sweeney Lynch. Sweeney also worked as Lynch's producer and co-wrote and produced \"The Straight Story\". The two married in May 2006, but filed for divorce that June. In 2009, Lynch married actress Emily Stofle, who appeared in his 2006 film \"Inland Empire\" as well as the 2017 revival of \"Twin Peaks\". The couple had one child, Lula Boginia Lynch, born in 2012. Stofle filed for divorce in 2023. A divorce settlement agreement was reached on December 20, 2024, but a final divorce decree had not been issued by the court at the time of his death. Mel Brooks, who produced \"The Elephant Man\", described Lynch as \"Jimmy Stewart from Mars.\" Lynch described himself as \"Eagle Scout, Missoula, Montana.\"\nPolitical and public views.\nLynch said he was \"not a political person\" and knew little about politics. Describing his political philosophy in 2006, he said, \"at that time [the 1990s], I thought of myself as a libertarian. I believed in next to zero government. And I still would lean toward no government and not so many rules, except for traffic lights and things like this. I really believe in traffic regulations.\" He continued: \"I'm a Democrat now. And I've always been a Democrat, really. But I don't like the Democrats a lot, either, because I'm a smoker, and I think a lot of the Democrats have come up with these rules for non-smoking.\" He said he voted for Ronald Reagan in the 1984 U.S. presidential election; in the 2000 U.S. presidential election he endorsed the Natural Law Party, which advocated Transcendental Meditation. He said he would vote for Democratic incumbent Barack Obama in the 2012 U.S. presidential election.\nIn 2009, Lynch signed a petition in support of director Roman Polanski after Polanski's arrest on his 1977 sexual abuse charges. Polanski had been detained while traveling to a film festival. The petition argued the arrest would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown \"freely and safely\", and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door \"for actions of which no-one can know the effects.\"\nIn the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Lynch endorsed Bernie Sanders, whom he described as \"for the people\", He voted for Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primaries, and for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson in the general election. In a June 2018 interview with \"The Guardian\", Lynch said that Donald Trump could go down as \"one of the greatest presidents in history because he has disrupted the [country] so much. No one is able to counter this guy in an intelligent way.\" He added: \"Our so-called leaders can't take the country forward, can't get anything done. Like children, they are. Trump has shown all this.\" The interviewer clarified that \"while Trump may not be doing a good job himself, Lynch thinks, he is opening up a space where other outsiders might.\" At a rally later that month, Trump read out sections of the interview, claiming Lynch was a supporter. Lynch later clarified on Facebook that his words were taken out of context, saying that Trump would \"not have a chance to go down in history as a great president\" if he continued on the course of \"causing suffering and division\" and advising him to \"treat all the people as you would like to be treated\".\nIn one of his daily weather report videos in 2020, Lynch expressed support for Black Lives Matter protests following the murder of George Floyd. In another weather report in 2022, Lynch condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and addressed Russian president Vladimir Putin directly, telling him there was \"no room for this kind of absurdity anymore\" and that Putin would reap what he had sown, lifetime after lifetime.\nTranscendental Meditation.\nLynch advocated Transcendental Meditation as a spiritual practice. He was initiated into Transcendental Meditation in July 1973, and practiced the technique consistently thereafter. Lynch said he met Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of the TM movement, for the first time in 1975 at the Spiritual Regeneration Movement center in Los Angeles, California. He became close with the Maharishi during a month-long \"Millionaire's Enlightenment Course\" held in 2003, the fee for which was $1 million.\nIn July 2005, Lynch launched the David Lynch Foundation for Consciousness-Based Education and Peace, established to help finance scholarships for students in middle and high schools who are interested in learning Transcendental Meditation and to fund research on the technique and its effects on learning. Together with John Hagelin and Fred Travis, a brain researcher from Maharishi University of Management (MUM), Lynch promoted his vision on college campuses with a tour that began in September 2005. Lynch was on MUM's board of trustees and hosted an annual \"David Lynch Weekend for World Peace and Meditation\" there, beginning in 2005. The foundation has also funded meditation lessons for veterans and other \"at-risk\" populations.\nLynch was working for the building and establishment of seven buildings in which 8,000 salaried people would practice advanced meditation techniques, \"pumping peace for the world\". He estimated the cost at US$7\u00a0billion. As of December 2005, he had spent $400,000 of his money and raised $1\u00a0million in donations. In December 2006, \"The New York Times\" reported that he continued to have that goal. Lynch's book \"Catching the Big Fish\" (Tarcher/Penguin, 2006) discusses Transcendental Meditation's effect on his creative process. Lynch attended the funeral of the Maharishi in India in 2008. He told a reporter, \"In life, he revolutionized the lives of millions of people. ... In 20, 50, 500 years there will be millions of people who will know and understand what the Maharishi has done.\" In 2009, Lynch went to India to film interviews with people who knew the Maharishi as part of a biographical documentary.\nIn 2009, Lynch organized a benefit concert at Radio City Music Hall for the David Lynch Foundation. On April 4, 2009, the \"Change Begins Within\" concert featured Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Donovan, Sheryl Crow, Eddie Vedder, Moby, Bettye LaVette, Ben Harper, and Mike Love of the Beach Boys. \"David Wants to Fly\", released in May 2010, is a documentary by German filmmaker David Sieveking \"that follows the path of his professional idol, David Lynch, into the world of Transcendental Meditation (TM)\". At the end of the film, Sieveking becomes disillusioned with Lynch.\nAn independent project starring Lynch called \"Beyond The Noise: My Transcendental Meditation Journey\", directed by film student Dana Farley, who has severe dyslexia and attention deficit disorder, was shown at film festivals in 2011, including the Marbella Film Festival. Filmmaker Kevin Sean Michaels is one of the producers. In 2013, Lynch wrote: \"Transcendental Meditation leads to a beautiful, peaceful revolution. A change from suffering and negativity to happiness and a life more and more free of any problems.\"\nIn a 2019 interview of Lynch by British artist Alexander de Cadenet, Lynch said of : \"Here's an experience that utilizes the full brain. That's what it's for. It's for enlightenment, for higher states of consciousness, culminating in the highest state of unity consciousness.\" In April 2022, Lynch announced a $500 million transcendental meditation world peace initiative to fund transcendental meditation for 30,000 college students. In September 2024, Lynch made his last published broadcast speech at Meditate America 2024, where he discussed The Beatles and John Lennon's practice of TM in the late 1960s and played a cover of \"Across the Universe\".\nWebsite.\nLynch designed his personal website, a site exclusive to paying members, where he posted short videos and his absurdist series \"Dumbland\", plus interviews and other items. The site also featured a daily weather report where Lynch gave a brief description of the weather in Los Angeles, where he resided. He continued to broadcast this weather report (usually no longer than 30 seconds) on his personal YouTube channel, \"DAVID LYNCH THEATER\", along with \"TODAY'S NUMBER\", where he drew a random number, between one and ten, out of a bingo cage. Lynch also created a short film, \"Rabbits\", for his website.\nLynch was a coffee drinker and had his own line of special organic blends available for purchase on his website and at Whole Foods. Called \"David Lynch Signature Cup\", the coffee has been advertised via flyers included with several Lynch-related DVD releases, including \"Inland Empire\" and the Gold Box edition of \"Twin Peaks\". The brand's tagline is \"It's all in the beans ... and I'm just full of beans\", a line Justin Theroux's character says in \"Inland Empire\".\nIllness and death.\nIn August 2024, Lynch said in an interview that he had been diagnosed with emphysema in 2020 after a lifetime of smoking and had become housebound due to health risks, which he surmised would likely prevent him from directing any new projects. Three months later, he told \"People\" that he had quit smoking in 2022, having started when he was eight years old; he said he was reliant on supplemental oxygen for most daily activities and could \"hardly walk across a room\".\nIn January 2025, Lynch was evacuated from his Los Angeles home due to the Southern California wildfires; according to \"Deadline Hollywood\", these events preceded a terminal decline in his health. He died from complications of emphysema at his daughter's home on January 15, five days before his 79th birthday. His family informed TMZ the next day.\nSteven Spielberg, who cast Lynch as John Ford in \"The Fabelmans\", wrote upon his death: \"Here was one of my heroes\u2014David Lynch playing one of my heroes [...] The world is going to miss such an original and unique voice. His films have already stood the test of time and they always will.\" Martin Scorsese wrote a statement that read in part, \"He put images on the screen unlike anything that I or anybody else had ever seen\u2014he made everything strange, uncanny, revelatory and new.\" Lynch's collaborators Nicolas Cage, Kyle MacLachlan, and Naomi Watts wrote tributes to him. Tributes were also paid by Judd Apatow, Mel Brooks, Francis Ford Coppola, James Gunn, Ron Howard, Patton Oswalt, Pedro Pascal, Billy Corgan, Questlove, and Ben Stiller. Critic Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" eulogized Lynch as \"the great American surrealist\"."}
{"id": "7892", "revid": "877242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7892", "title": "David Cronenberg", "text": "David Paul Cronenberg (born March 15, 1943) is a Canadian film director, screenwriter, producer and actor. He is a principal originator of the body horror genre, with his films exploring visceral bodily transformation, infectious diseases, and the intertwining of the psychological, physical, and technological. Cronenberg is best known for exploring these themes through sci-fi horror films such as \"Shivers\" (1975), \"Scanners\" (1981), \"Videodrome\" (1983) and \"The Fly\" (1986), though he has also directed dramas, psychological thrillers and gangster films.\nCronenberg's films have polarized critics and audiences alike; he has earned critical acclaim and has sparked controversy for his depictions of gore and violence. \"The Village Voice\" called him \"the most audacious and challenging narrative director in the English-speaking world\". His films have won numerous awards, including the Special Jury Prize for \"Crash\" at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, a unique award that is distinct from the Jury Prize as it is not given annually, but only at the request of the official jury, who in this case gave the award \"for originality, for daring, and for audacity\".\nFrom the 2000s to the 2020s, Cronenberg collaborated on several films with Viggo Mortensen, including \"A History of Violence\" (2005), \"Eastern Promises\" (2007), \"A Dangerous Method\" (2011) and \"Crimes of the Future\" (2022). Seven of his films were selected to compete for the Palme d'Or, the most recent being \"The Shrouds\" (2024), which was screened at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival.\nEarly life and education.\nDavid Cronenberg was born in Toronto, Ontario, on March 15, 1943. Cronenberg is the son of Esther ( Sumberg), a musician, and Milton Cronenberg, a writer and editor. He was raised in a \"middle-class progressive Jewish family\". His father was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and his mother was born in Toronto; all of his grandparents were Jews from Lithuania. Milton wrote some short stories for \"True Detective\" and had a column in the \"Toronto Telegram\" for around thirty years. The Cronenberg household was full of a wide variety of books, and Cronenberg's father tried to introduce his son to art films such as \"The Seventh Seal\", although at the time Cronenberg was more interested in western and pirate films, showing a particular affinity for those featuring Burt Lancaster.\nA voracious reader from an early age, Cronenberg started off enjoying science fiction magazines like \"The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction\", \"Galaxy\", and \"Astounding\", where he first encountered authors who would prove influential on his own work, including Ray Bradbury and Isaac Asimov, although he wouldn't encounter his primary influence, Philip K. Dick, until much later. Cronenberg also read comic books, noting his favorites were \"Tarzan\", \"Little Lulu\", \"Uncle Scrooge\", \"Blackhawk\", \"Plastic Man\", \"Superman\", and the original Fawcett Comics version of \"Captain Marvel\", later known as \"Shazam\". Although as an adult, Cronenberg feels superhero films are artistically limited, he maintains a fondness for \"Captain Marvel\"/\"Shazam\", criticizing how he feels the character had been neglected. Cronenberg also read horror comics published by EC, which in contrast to the others, he described as \"scary and bizarre and violent and nasty\u2014the ones your mother didn't want you to have.\"\nEarly films that later proved influential on Cronenberg's career include avant-garde, horror, science fiction, and thriller films, such as \"Un Chien Andalou\", \"Vampyr\", \"War of the Worlds\", \"Freaks\", \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\", \"Alphaville\", \"Performance\", and \"Duel\". He also cited less obvious films as influences, including comedies like \"The Bed Sitting Room\", as well as Disney cartoons such as \"Bambi\" and \"Dumbo\". Cronenberg said he found these two Disney animated films, as well as Universal's live-action \"Blue Lagoon\", \"terrifying\" which influenced his approach to horror. Cronenberg went on to say that \"Bambi\" was the \"first important film\" he ever saw, citing the moment when Bambi's mother died as particularly powerful. Cronenberg even wished to screen \"Bambi\" as part of a museum exhibition of his influences, but Disney refused him permission. In terms of conventional horror films that frightened him, Cronenberg cited \"Don't Look Now\".\nCronenberg attended Dewson Street Public School, Kent Senior School, Harbord Collegiate Institute and North Toronto Collegiate Institute. He enrolled at the University of Toronto for Honours Science in 1963, but changed to Honours English Language and Literature the next year. He graduated from university in 1967, at the top of his class with a general Bachelor of Arts. Cronenberg decided to not study for a master of arts after making \"Stereo\".\nCronenberg's fascination with the film \"Winter Kept Us Warm\" (1966), by classmate David Secter, sparked his interest in film. He began frequenting film camera rental houses and learned the art of filmmaking. Cronenberg made two short films, \"Transfer\" and \"From the Drain\", with a few hundred dollars. Cronenberg, Ivan Reitman, Bob Fothergill, and Iain Ewing were inspired by Jonas Mekas and formed the Toronto Film Co-op.\nCareer.\n1969\u20131979: Film debut and early work.\nAfter two short sketch films and two short art-house features (the black-and-white \"Stereo\" and the colour \"Crimes of the Future\") Cronenberg went into partnership with Ivan Reitman. The Canadian government provided financing for his films throughout the 1970s. During this period, he focused on his signature \"body horror\" films such as \"Shivers\" and \"Rabid\", the latter of which provided pornographic actress Marilyn Chambers with work in a different genre, although Cronenberg's first choice for the role had been a then little-known Sissy Spacek. \"Rabid\" was a breakthrough with international distributors, and his next two horror features, \"The Brood\" and \"Scanners\", gained stronger support.Even then, he showed variety by making \"Fast Company\" between \"The Brood\" and \"Rabid\", a project reflecting his interest in car racing and bike gangs.\n1981\u20131988: Breakthrough and acclaim.\nIn 1981, Cronenberg directed the science-fiction horror film \"Scanners\" (1981). In the film, \"scanners\" are psychics with unusual telepathic and telekinetic powers. The film has since become a cult classic. In 1983 he directed another science-fiction horror film \"Videodrome\" starring James Woods. The film was distributed by Universal Pictures. Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" remarked on the film's \"innovativeness\", and praised Woods' performance as having a \"sharply authentic edge\". That same year he directed \"The Dead Zone\" (1983) starring Christopher Walken.\nCronenberg directed \"The Fly\" (1986) starring Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis. The film is loosely based on George Langelaan's 1957 short story of the same name and the 1958 film of the same name. It was distributed by 20th Century Fox and was a box office hit making $60 million. Cronenberg has not generally worked within the world of big-budget, mainstream Hollywood filmmaking, although he has had occasional near misses. At one stage he was considered by George Lucas as a possible director for \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983) but turned down the offer. Since \"Dead Ringers\" (1988), Cronenberg has worked with cinematographer Peter Suschitzky on each of his films (see List of film director and cinematographer collaborations). Suschitzky was the director of photography for \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980), and Cronenberg remarked that Suschitzky's work in that film \"was the only one of those movies that actually looked good\", which was a motivating factor to work with him on \"Dead Ringers\".\nCronenberg has collaborated with composer Howard Shore on all of his films since \"The Brood\" (1979), (see List of film director and composer collaborations) with the exception of \"The Dead Zone\" (1983), which was scored by Michael Kamen. Other regular collaborators include actor Robert Silverman, art director Carol Spier (also his sister) sound editor Bryan Day, film editor Ronald Sanders, his sister, costume designer Denise Cronenberg, and, from 1979 until 1988, cinematographer Mark Irwin. In 2008, Cronenberg directed Howard Shore's first opera, \"The Fly\".\n1991\u20132002: Career fluctuations.\nCronenberg has cited William S. Burroughs and Vladimir Nabokov as influences. Perhaps the best example of a film that straddles the line between his works of personal chaos and psychological confusion is Cronenberg's 1991 \"adaptation\" of \"Naked Lunch\" (1959), his literary hero William S. Burroughs' most controversial book. The novel was considered \"unfilmable\", and Cronenberg acknowledged that a straight translation into film would \"cost 400 million dollars and be banned in every country in the world\". Instead\u2014much like in his earlier film, \"Videodrome\"\u2014he consistently blurred the lines between what appeared to be reality and what appeared to be hallucinations brought on by the main character's drug addiction. Some of the book's \"moments\" (as well as incidents loosely based upon Burroughs' life) are presented in this manner within the film. Cronenberg stated that while writing the screenplay for \"Naked Lunch\" (1991), he felt a moment of synergy with Burroughs' writing style. He felt the connection between his screenwriting style and Burroughs' prose style was so strong, that he jokingly remarked that should Burroughs pass on, he might write his next novel.\nCronenberg has also appeared as an actor in other directors' films. Most of his roles are cameo appearances, as in the films \"Into the Night\" (1985), \"Blood and Donuts\" (1995), \"To Die For\" (1995), and \"Jason X\" (2002) and the television series \"Alias\", but on occasion he has played major roles, as in \"Nightbreed\" (1990) and \"Last Night\" (1998). He has not had major roles in any of his own films, but he did put in a brief appearance as a gynecologist in \"The Fly\"; he can also be glimpsed among the sex-crazed hordes in \"Shivers\"; he can be heard as an unseen car-pound attendant in \"Crash\"; his hands can be glimpsed in \"eXistenZ\" (1999); and he appeared as a stand-in for James Woods in \"Videodrome\".\nCronenberg has said that his films should be seen \"from the point of view of the disease\", and that in \"Shivers\", for example, he identifies with the characters \"after\" they become infected with the anarchic parasites. Disease and disaster, in Cronenberg's work, are less problems to be overcome than agents of personal transformation. Of his characters' transformations, Cronenberg said, \"But because of our necessity to impose our own structure of perception on things we look on ourselves as being relatively stable. But, in fact, when I look at a person I see this maelstrom of organic, chemical and electron chaos; volatility and instability, shimmering; and the ability to change and transform and transmute.\" Similarly, in \"Crash\" (1996), people who have been injured in car crashes attempt to view their ordeal as \"a fertilizing rather than a destructive event\". In 2005, Cronenberg publicly disagreed with Paul Haggis' choice of the same name for the latter's Oscar-winning film \"Crash\" (2004), arguing that it was \"very disrespectful\" to the \"important and seminal\" J. G. Ballard novel on which Cronenberg's film was based.\n2005\u2013present: Resurgence.\nHis thriller \"A History of Violence\" (2005) is one of his highest budgeted and most accessible to date. He has said that the decision to direct it was influenced by his having had to defer some of his salary on the low-budgeted \"Spider\" (2002), but it was one of his most critically acclaimed films to date, along with \"Eastern Promises\" (2007), a film about the struggle of one man to gain power in the Russian Mafia. Although Cronenberg has worked with a number of Hollywood stars, he remains a staunchly Canadian filmmaker, with nearly all of his films (including major studio vehicles \"The Dead Zone\" and \"The Fly\") having been filmed in his home province Ontario. Notable exceptions include \"M. Butterfly\" (1993), most of which was shot in China, \"Spider\", and \"Eastern Promises\" (2007), which were both filmed primarily in England, and \"A Dangerous Method\" (2011), which was filmed in Germany and Austria. \"Rabid\" and \"Shivers\" were shot in and around Montreal. Most of his films have been at least partially financed by Telefilm Canada, and Cronenberg, a vocal supporter of government-backed film projects, has said: \"Every country needs [a system of government grants] to have a national cinema in the face of Hollywood\".\nIn 2008, Cronenberg realized two extra-cinematographic projects: the exhibition \"Chromosomes\" at the Rome Film Fest, and the opera \"The Fly\" at the LaOpera in Los Angeles and Theatre Ch\u00e2telet in Paris. In July 2010, Cronenberg completed production on \"A Dangerous Method\" (2011), an adaptation of Christopher Hampton's play \"The Talking Cure\", starring Keira Knightley, Michael Fassbender, Vincent Cassel, and frequent collaborator Viggo Mortensen. The film was produced by independent British producer Jeremy Thomas. On television, he has appeared in the recurring roles of Dr. Brezzel in Season 3 of \"Alias\", and Kovich in seasons 3, 4, and 5 of \"\". He has also had main roles as Reverend Verrenger in \"Alias Grace\", and Spencer Galloway in \"Slasher: Flesh &amp; Blood\".\nIn 2012, his film \"Cosmopolis\" competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival. For a time it appeared that, as \"Eastern Promises\" producer Paul Webster told Screen International, a sequel was in the works that would reunite the key team of Cronenberg, Steven Knight, and Viggo Mortensen. It was slated for production by Webster's new company \"Shoebox Films\" in collaboration with Focus Features, and shot in early 2013. In 2012, Cronenberg said the \"Eastern Promises\" sequel had fallen through due to budget disagreement with Focus Features.\nFilming for Cronenberg's next film, a satire drama entitled \"Maps to the Stars\" (2014)\u2014with Julianne Moore, Mia Wasikowska, John Cusack, and Robert Pattinson\u2014began on July 8, 2013, in Toronto, Ontario and Los Angeles. This was the first time Cronenberg filmed in the United States. On June 26, 2014, Cronenberg's short film \"The Nest\" was published on YouTube. The film was commissioned for \"David Cronenberg \u2013 The Exhibition\" at EYE Film Institute in Amsterdam and was available on YouTube for the duration of the exhibition, until September 14, 2014. Also in 2014, Cronenberg published his first novel, \"Consumed\". In a May 2016 interview, Viggo Mortensen revealed that Cronenberg is considering retiring due to difficulty financing his film projects.\nCronenberg appears as himself in the minute-long short film \"The Death of David Cronenberg\", shot by his daughter Caitlin, which was released digitally on September 19, 2021. In February 2021, Mortensen said Cronenberg had refined an older script he had written and hopes to film it with Mortensen that summer. He further hinted that it is a \"strange film noir\" and resembles Cronenberg's earlier body horror films. In April 2021, the title was revealed to be \"Crimes of the Future\". It was shot in Greece during the summer of 2021, and competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival. Cronenberg's next film \"The Shrouds\" is set to premier at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival in competition, and be released theatrically in September 2024.\nUnrealized projects.\nOne of Cronenberg's earliest unproduced film concepts was \"Roger Pagan, Gynecologist\", about a neurotic man who impersonates a medical expert. The project was initially conceived in the early 1970s in the form of a novel.\nIn the early 1980s Cronenberg attempted to make a film adaption of Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\" that took place in the modern day. Cronenberg wrote an original script for Universal after \"Videodrome\" titled \"Six Legs\", but the film was never made although aspects were incorporated into \"The Fly\" and \"Naked Lunch\".\nCronenberg was offered the role of director for \"Witness\" while it was under the name \"Come Home\", but declined as he \"could never be a fan of the Amish\". He was also offered the director's position for \"Flashdance\", \"Top Gun\", and \"Beverly Hills Cop\". Marc Boyman offered Cronenberg the position of director for \"The Incubus\", but declined although this led to Boyman producing \"The Fly\" and \"Dead Ringers\".\nCronenberg also worked for nearly a year on a version of \"Total Recall\" (1990), but experienced \"creative differences\" with producers Dino De Laurentiis and Ronald Shusett; a different version of the film was eventually made by Paul Verhoeven. Cronenberg related in his 1992 memoir, \"Cronenberg on Cronenberg\" that, as a fan of Philip K. Dick\u2014author of \"We Can Remember it For You Wholesale\", the short story upon which the film was based\u2014 his dissatisfaction with what he envisioned the film to be and what it ended up being pained him so greatly that, for a time, he suffered a migraine just thinking about it, akin to a needle piercing his eye.\nIn 1993, Cronenberg signed a deal with Paragon Entertainment Corporation in which he would create a six-part television series for CBC Television. Cronenberg started writing it on August 1, and filming was meant to begin in February 1994 using 35\u00a0mm film. The show was set in 2010 and was about members of The Flesh Squad police force. Carol Reynolds, the president of Paragon Entertainment, stated that each episode would cost between $500,000-600,000.\nIn the October 2011 edition of \"Rue Morgue\", Cronenberg stated that he has written a companion piece to his 1986 remake of \"The Fly\", which he would like to direct if given the chance. He has stated that it is not a traditional sequel, but rather a \"parallel story\".\nPersonal life.\nCronenberg lives in Toronto. He married his first wife, Margaret Hindson, in 1972: their seven-year marriage ended in 1979 amidst personal and professional differences. They had one daughter, Cassandra Cronenberg. His second wife was film editor Carolyn Zeifman, to whom he was married from 1979 until her death in 2017. The couple met on the set of \"Rabid\" while she was working as a production assistant. They have two children, Caitlin and Brandon. In the book \"Cronenberg on Cronenberg\" (1992), he revealed that \"The Brood\" was inspired by events that occurred during the unraveling of his first marriage, which caused both Cronenberg and his daughter Cassandra a great deal of turmoil. The character Nola Carveth, mother of the brood, is based on Cassandra's mother. Cronenberg said that he found the shooting of the climactic scene, in which Nola was strangled by her husband, to be \"very satisfying\".\nIn a September 2013 interview, Cronenberg revealed that film director Martin Scorsese admitted to him that he was intrigued by Cronenberg's early work but was subsequently \"terrified\" to meet him in person. Cronenberg responded to Scorsese: \"You're the guy who made \"Taxi Driver\" and you're afraid to meet me?\" In the same interview, Cronenberg identified as an atheist. \"Anytime I've tried to imagine squeezing myself into the box of any particular religion, I find it claustrophobic and oppressive,\" Cronenberg elaborated. \"I think atheism is an acceptance of what is real.\" In the same interview, Cronenberg revealed that it depends on the \"time of day\" as to whether or not he is afraid of death. He further stated that he is not concerned about posthumous representations of his film work: \"It wouldn't disturb me to think that my work would just sink beneath the waves without trace and that would be it. So what? It doesn't bother me.\"\nIn \"Cronenberg on Cronenberg\", the director further elaborated that he was raised in a secular Jewish home, and while he and his family had no disdain towards any religion, such matters were not discussed. In the same book, Cronenberg said that in his teens he went through a phase where he wondered about the existence of God, but ultimately came to the conclusion that the God concept was developed to cope with the fear of death. In a 2007 interview, Cronenberg explained the role atheism plays in his work. He stated, \"I'm interested in saying, 'Let us discuss the existential question. We are all going to die, that is the end of all consciousness. There is no afterlife. There is no God. Now what do we do.' That's the point where it starts getting interesting to me.\"\nIn Cronenberg's later films (e.g. \"A History of Violence\", \"Eastern Promises\" and \"A Dangerous Method\") openly religious characters become more common. During an interview for \"A History of Violence\", Cronenberg even chose to identify as a materialist rather than an atheist, stating, \"I'm not an atheist, but for me to turn away from any aspect of the human body to me is a philosophical betrayal. And there's a lot of art and religion whose whole purpose is to turn away from the human body. I feel in my art that my mandate is to not do that.\"\nIn a separate 2013 interview, Cronenberg discussed the role religion plays in his films, using \"Eastern Promises\" as the main example:\nI'm an atheist but not all my characters are atheists. So it's true that I don't think about God ever as part of my life or anything. But if you're a dramatist and you are working with characters who come from a particular culture, you have to accept their understanding of life, and with passion. So the Nikolai character, I'm pretty sure he believes in God and most of the other characters in the movie do too. Some of them are Muslim, some of them are Eastern Orthodox, and that's a part of their life, a part of their understanding of suffering. Because everybody in life suffers but not everybody thinks of that in religious terms. These people do. And they think of suffering as a way to salvation, also in religious terms. I am their God really, as I am creating them; that's religious in itself. I am a very hardcore atheist believe me but you become like an actor really, as a director or a writer. You must take on the character as that character is and believe in it as you're playing it. To allow that character to exist as he would exist. That's really what it's all about, so I have no problem with characters who are religious and believe in God. I would have a problem if that was the point of the whole story because that bores me and I just don't have any emotional or intellectual respect for it, frankly.\nAwards and recognition.\nCronenberg has appeared on various \"Greatest Director\" lists. In 2004, Science Fiction magazine \"Strange Horizons\" named him the second greatest director in the history of the genre, ahead of better known directors such as Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Jean-Luc Godard, and Ridley Scott. In the same year, \"The Guardian\" listed him 9th on their list of \"The world's 40 best directors\". In 2007, Total Film named him as the 17th greatest director of all time. Film professor Charles Derry, in his overview of the horror genre \"Dark Dreams\", called the director one of the most important in his field, and that \"no discussion of contemporary horror film can conclude without reference to the films of David Cronenberg.\"\nCronenberg received the Special Jury Prize at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival for \"Crash\". In 1999, he was inducted onto Canada's Walk of Fame, awarded the Silver Bear Award at the 49th Berlin International Film Festival. and that November received the Governor General's Performing Arts Award, Canada's highest honour in the performing arts.\nIn 2002, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, and was promoted to Companion of the Order of Canada (the order's highest rank) in 2014. In 2006 he was awarded the Cannes Film Festival's lifetime achievement award, the Carrosse d'Or. In 2009 Cronenberg received the L\u00e9gion d'honneur from the government of France. The following year Cronenberg was named an honorary patron of the University Philosophical Society, Trinity College Dublin. In 2012, he received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.\nThe opening of the \"David Cronenberg: Evolution\" Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) exhibition occurred on October 30, 2013. Held at the TIFF Bell Lightbox venue, the exhibition paid tribute to the director's entire filmmaking career and the festival's promotional material referred to Cronenberg as \"one of Canada's most prolific and iconic filmmakers\". The exhibition was shown internationally following the conclusion of the TIFF showing on January 19, 2014.\nIn 2014, he was made a Member of the Order of Ontario in recognition for being \"Canada's most celebrated internationally acclaimed filmmaker\".\nIn April 2018, it was announced that Cronenberg would receive the honorary Golden Lion at the 75th Venice International Film Festival.\nAcademy of Canadian Cinema and Television.\nBest Picture\nBest Director\nBest Screenplay"}

His aggressive driving style earned him the nicknames \"the Intimidator\", \"the Man in Black\" and \"Ironhead\"; after his son Dale Earnhardt Jr. joined the Cup Series circuit in 1999, Earnhardt was generally known by the retronyms Dale Earnhardt Sr. and Dale Sr. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest drivers in NASCAR history and was named as one of the NASCAR's 50 Greatest Drivers class in 1998.\nThe third child of racing driver Ralph Earnhardt and Martha Earnhardt, he began his career in 1975 in the World 600. Earnhardt won a total of 76 Winston Cup races over the course of his 26-year career, including four Winston 500s (1990, 1994, 1999, and 2000) and the 1998 Daytona 500. Along with his 76 career points wins, he has also won 24 non-points exhibition events, bringing his overall Winston Cup win total to 100, one of only four drivers in NASCAR history to do so. He is the only driver in NASCAR history to score at least one win in four different and consecutive decades (scoring his first career win in 1979, 38 wins in the 1980s, 35 wins in the 1990s, &amp; scoring his final two career wins in 2000). He also earned seven Winston Cup championships, a record held with Richard Petty and Jimmie Johnson.\nOn February 18, 2001, Earnhardt died as a result of a basilar skull fracture sustained in a sudden last-lap crash during the Daytona 500. His death was regarded in the racing industry as being a crucial moment in improving safety in all aspects of car racing, especially NASCAR. He was 49 years old. Earnhardt has been inducted into numerous halls of fame, including the NASCAR Hall of Fame inaugural class in 2010.\nBiography.\nEarly and personal life.\nRalph Dale Earnhardt was born on April 29, 1951, in the suburb of Kannapolis, North Carolina, as the third child of Martha ( Coleman, 1930\u20132021) and Ralph Earnhardt (1928\u20131973). Earnhardt's father was one of the best short-track drivers in North Carolina at the time and won his first and only NASCAR Sportsman Championship in 1956 at Greenville Pickens Speedway in Greenville, South Carolina. In 1963 at the age of 12, Dale Earnhardt secretly drove his father's car in one of his races and had a near victory against one of his father's closest competitors. In 1972, he raced his father at Metrolina Speedway in a race with cars from semi mod and sportsman divisions. Although Ralph did not want his son to pursue a career as a race car driver, Dale dropped out of school to pursue his dreams. Ralph was a hard teacher for Dale, and after Ralph suddenly died of a heart attack at his home in 1973 at age 45, it took many years before Dale felt as though he had finally \"proven\" himself to his father. Earnhardt had four siblings: two brothers, Danny (died 2021) and Randy (died 2013); and two sisters, Cathy and Kaye.\nEarnhardt was married three times. In 1968, at the age of 17, Earnhardt married his first wife, Latane Brown. With her, Earnhardt fathered his first son, Kerry, a year later. Earnhardt and Brown divorced in 1970. In 1971, Earnhardt married his second wife, Brenda Gee, the daughter of NASCAR car builder Robert Gee. In his marriage with Gee, Earnhardt had two children: a daughter, Kelley King Earnhardt, in 1972, and a son, Dale Earnhardt Jr., in 1974. Not long after Dale Jr. was born, Earnhardt and Gee divorced. Earnhardt then married his third wife, Teresa Houston, in 1982. She gave birth to their daughter, Taylor Nicole Earnhardt, in 1988.\nNASCAR career.\nEarly Winston Cup career (1975\u20131978).\nEarnhardt began his professional career in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series in 1975, making his points race debut at Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina in the longest race on the Cup circuit\u2014the 1975 World 600. He had made his Grand National debut in 1974 in an unofficial invitational exhibition race at Metrolina Speedway, where with eight laps to go he got under Richard Childress and spun out when battling for third. He drove the No. 8 Ed Negre Dodge Charger and finished 22nd in that race, just one spot ahead of his future car owner, Richard Childress. Earnhardt competed in eight more races until 1979.\nRod Osterlund Racing (1979\u20131980).\nWhen he joined car owner Rod Osterlund Racing in a season that included a rookie class of future stars including Earnhardt, Harry Gant, and Terry Labonte in his rookie season, Earnhardt won one race at Bristol, captured four poles, scored eleven Top 5s and seventeen Top 10s, and finished seventh in the points standings despite missing four races due to a broken collarbone, winning Rookie of the Year honors.\nDuring his sophomore season, Earnhardt, now with 20-year-old Doug Richert as his crew chief, began the season winning the Busch Clash. With wins at Atlanta, Bristol, Nashville, Martinsville, and Charlotte, Earnhardt won his first Winston Cup points championship. He is the only driver in NASCAR Cup history to follow a Rookie of the Year title with a NASCAR Winston Cup Championship the next season. He was also the third driver in NASCAR history to win both the Rookie of the Year and Winston Cup Series championship, following David Pearson (1960, 1966) and Richard Petty (1959, 1964). Ten drivers have since joined this exclusive club: Rusty Wallace (1984, 1989), Alan Kulwicki (1986, 1992), Jeff Gordon (1993, 1995), Tony Stewart (1999, 2002), Matt Kenseth (2000, 2003), Kevin Harvick (2001, 2014), Kyle Busch (2005, 2015), Joey Logano (2009, 2018, 2022, 2024), Chase Elliott (2016, 2020), and Kyle Larson (2014, 2021).\nRod Osterlund Racing, Stacy Racing, and Richard Childress Racing (1981).\n1981 would prove to be tumultuous for the defending Winston Cup champion. Sixteen races into the season, Rod Osterlund suddenly sold his team to Jim Stacy, an entrepreneur from Kentucky who entered NASCAR in 1977. After just four races, Earnhardt fell out with Stacy and left the team. Earnhardt finished out the year driving Pontiacs for Richard Childress Racing and managed to place seventh in the final points standings. Earnhardt departed RCR at the end of the season, citing a lack of chemistry.\nEarnhardt was also a color commentator for the Busch Clash, while he also drove on that same day.\nBud Moore Engineering (1982\u20131983).\nThe following year, at Childress's suggestion, Earnhardt joined car owner Bud Moore for the 1982 and 1983 seasons driving the No. 15 Wrangler Jeans-sponsored Ford Thunderbird (the only full-time Ford ride in his career). During the 1982 season, Earnhardt struggled. Although he won at Darlington, he failed to finish 18 of the 30 races and ended the season 12th in points, the worst of his career. He also suffered a broken kneecap at Pocono Raceway when he flipped after contact with Tim Richmond. In 1983, Earnhardt rebounded and won his first of 12 Twin 125 Daytona 500 qualifying races. He won at Nashville and at Talladega, finishing eighth in the points standings, despite failing to finish 13 of the 30 races.\nReturn to Richard Childress Racing (1984\u20132001).\n1984\u20131985.\nAfter the 1983 season, Earnhardt returned to Richard Childress Racing, replacing Ricky Rudd in the No. 3. Rudd went to Bud Moore's No. 15, replacing Earnhardt. Wrangler sponsored both drivers at their respective teams. During the 1984 and 1985 seasons, Earnhardt went to victory lane six times, at Talladega, Atlanta, Richmond, Bristol (twice), and Martinsville, where he finished fourth and eighth in the season standings respectively.\n1986\u20131987.\nThe 1986 season saw Earnhardt win his second career Winston Cup Championship and the first owner's championship for Richard Childress Racing. He won five races and had 16 top-fives and 23 top-10s. Earnhardt successfully defended his championship the following year, going to victory lane 11 times and winning the championship by 489 points over Bill Elliott. In the process, Earnhardt set a NASCAR modern-era record of four consecutive wins and won five of the first seven races. In the 1987 season, he earned the nickname \"the Intimidator\", due in part to the 1987 Winston All-Star Race. During this race, Earnhardt was briefly forced into the infield grass but kept control of his car and returned to the track without giving up his lead. The maneuver is now referred to as the \"Pass in the Grass\", even though Earnhardt did not pass anyone while he was off the track. After The Winston, an angry fan sent Bill France Jr. a letter threatening to kill Earnhardt at Pocono, Watkins Glen, or Dover, prompting the FBI to provide security for Earnhardt on the three tracks. The investigation was closed after the races at the three tracks finished without incident. Many of Earnhardt's competitors on the racetrack disliked his personal driving style. Earnhardt's relentless pursuit of victory on the racetrack combined with his uniquely offensive driving ability led to many rivalries with fellow drivers and fines levied by NASCAR. In 1987, NASCAR began to implement a measure that was designed to incentivize less aggressive driving styles by forcing drivers who cause these undesired hazardous racing conditions to be subjected to time at the garage region during the race.\n1988\u20131989.\nThe 1988 season saw Earnhardt racing with a new sponsor, GM Goodwrench, after Wrangler Jeans dropped its sponsorship in 1987. During this season, he changed the color of his paint scheme from blue and yellow to the signature black in which the No. 3 car was painted for the rest of his life. He won three races in 1988, finishing third in the points standings behind Bill Elliott in first and Rusty Wallace in second. The following year, Earnhardt won five races, but a late spin out at North Wilkesboro arguably cost him the 1989 championship, as Rusty Wallace edged him out for it by 12 points (Earnhardt won the final race, but Wallace finished 15th when needing to finish at least 18th to win). It was his first season for the GM Goodwrench Chevrolet Lumina.\n1990\u20131995.\nThe 1990 season started for Earnhardt with victories in the Busch Clash and his heat of the Gatorade Twin 125's. Near the end of the Daytona 500, he had a dominant forty-second lead when the final caution flag came out with a handful of laps to go. When the green flag waved, Earnhardt was leading Derrike Cope. On the final lap, Earnhardt ran over a piece of metal, which was later revealed as a bell housing, in turn 3, cutting down a tire. Cope, in an upset, won the race while Earnhardt finished fifth after leading 155 of the 200 laps. The No. 3 Goodwrench-sponsored Chevy team took the flat tire that cost them the win and hung it on the shop wall as a reminder of how close they had come to winning the Daytona 500. Earnhardt won nine races that season and won his fourth Winston Cup title, beating Mark Martin by 26 points. He also became the first multiple winner of the annual all-star race, The Winston. The 1991 season saw Earnhardt win his fifth Winston Cup championship. This season, he scored four wins and won the championship by 195 points over Ricky Rudd. One of his wins came at North Wilkesboro, in a race where Harry Gant had a chance to set a single-season record by winning his fifth consecutive race, breaking a record held by Earnhardt. Late in the race, Gant lost his brakes, which gave Earnhardt the chance he needed to make the pass for the win and maintain his record.\nEarnhardt's only win of the 1992 season came at Charlotte, in the Coca-Cola 600, ending a 13-race win streak by Ford teams. Earnhardt finished a career-low 12th in the points for the second time in his career, with three last place finishes (Daytona and Talladega in July and Martinsville in September), and the only time he had finished that low since joining Richard Childress Racing. He still made the trip to the annual Awards Banquet with Rusty Wallace but did not have the best seat in the house. Wallace stated he and Earnhardt had to sit on the backs of their chairs to see, and Earnhardt said, \"This sucks, I should have gone hunting.\" At the end of the year, longtime crew chief Kirk Shelmerdine left to become a driver. Andy Petree took over as crew chief. Hiring Petree turned out to be beneficial, as Earnhardt returned to the front in 1993. He once again came close to a win at the Daytona 500 and dominated Speedweeks before finishing second to Dale Jarrett on a last-lap pass. Earnhardt scored six wins en route to his sixth Winston Cup title, including wins in the first prime-time Coca-Cola 600 and The Winston, both at Charlotte, and the Pepsi 400 at Daytona. He beat Rusty Wallace for the championship by 80 points. On November 14, 1993, after the season-ending Hooters 500 at Atlanta, the race winner Wallace and 1993 series champion Earnhardt ran a dual Polish Victory Lap together while carrying #28 and #7 flags commemorating 1992 Daytona 500 winner Davey Allison and 1992 NASCAR Winston Cup Series champion Alan Kulwicki respectively, who both had died in separate plane accidents during the season.\nIn 1994, Earnhardt achieved a feat that he himself had believed to be impossible\u2014he scored his seventh Winston Cup championship, tying Richard Petty. He was very consistent, scoring four wins, and after Ernie Irvan was sidelined due to a near-deadly crash at Michigan (the two were neck-and-neck at the top of the points up until the crash), won the title by over 400 points over Mark Martin. Earnhardt sealed the deal at Rockingham by winning the race over Rick Mast. It was his final NASCAR championship and his final season for the GM Goodwrench Chevrolet Lumina. Earnhardt started off the 1995 season by finishing second in the Daytona 500 to Sterling Marlin. He won five races in 1995, including his first road course victory at Sears Point. He also won the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, a win he called the biggest of his career. But in the end, Earnhardt lost the championship to Jeff Gordon by 34 points. The GM Goodwrench racing team changed to Chevrolet Monte Carlos.\nEarnhardt almost was ready to leave the #3 at the end of the 1995 season, according to his former crew chief Larry McReynolds. At the time, McReynolds was the crew chief for the #28 Havoline Ford Thunderbird at Robert Yates Racing. Earnhardt had actually been approached by Yates to drive the #28 for the 1995 season in place of Ernie Irvan, who was injured in a crash during the 1994 season. Instead, Robert Yates signed Dale Jarrett to a one-year deal to drive the #28. During the 1995 season, Yates was being pressed by his manufacturer to start a second team and sent a contract to Earnhardt to drive it. Earnhardt never returned the contract, and according to McReynolds the reason he did not sign was because he only wanted to drive the #28 for Yates; the team fully intended to put Irvan back behind the wheel of his old car once he was able to resume driving. Instead, Earnhardt stayed with RCR and the #3, while Jarrett was signed to drive Yates' new car, numbered 88.\n1996\u20131999.\n1996 for Earnhardt started just like it had done in 1993\u2014he dominated Speedweeks, only to finish second in the Daytona 500 to Dale Jarrett for the second time. He won early in the year, scoring consecutive victories at Rockingham and Atlanta. On July 28 in the DieHard 500 at Talladega, he was second in points and looking for his eighth season title, despite the departure of crew chief Andy Petree. Late in the race, Ernie Irvan lost control of his No. 28 Havoline-sponsored Ford Thunderbird, made contact with the No. 4 Kodak-sponsored Chevy Monte Carlo of Sterling Marlin, and ignited a crash that saw Earnhardt's No. 3 Chevrolet hit the tri-oval wall nearly head-on at almost 200\u00a0mph. After hitting the wall, Earnhardt's car flipped and slid across the track, in front of race traffic. His car was hit in the roof and windshield. This accident, as well as a similar accident that led to the death of Russell Phillips at Charlotte, led NASCAR to mandate the \"Earnhardt Bar\", a metal brace located in the center of the windshield that reinforces the roof in case of a similar crash. This bar is also required in NASCAR-owned United SportsCar Racing and its predecessors for road racing.\nRain delays had canceled the live telecast of the race, and most fans first learned of the accident during the night's sports newscasts. Video of the crash showed what appeared to be a fatal incident, but once medical workers arrived at the car, Earnhardt climbed out and waved to the crowd, refusing to be loaded onto a stretcher despite a broken collarbone, sternum, and shoulder blade. Although the incident looked like it would end his season early, Earnhardt refused to stay out of the car. The next week at Indianapolis, he started the race but exited the car on the first pit stop, allowing Mike Skinner to take the wheel. When asked, Earnhardt said that vacating the No. 3 car was the hardest thing he had ever done. The following weekend at Watkins Glen, he drove the No. 3 Goodwrench Chevrolet to the fastest time in qualifying, earning the \"True Grit\" pole. T-shirts emblazoned with Earnhardt's face were quickly printed up, brandishing the caption, \"It Hurt So Good\". Earnhardt led for most of the race and looked to have victory in hand, but fatigue took its toll and he ended up sixth behind race winner Geoff Bodine. Earnhardt did not win again in 1996 but still finished fourth in the standings behind Terry Labonte, Jeff Gordon, and Dale Jarrett, with 2 wins, 13 top fives, 17 top tens, and his last 2 career poles, with an average finish of 10.6. David Smith departed as crew chief of the No. 3 team and RCR at the end of the year for personal reasons, and he was replaced by Larry McReynolds.\nIn 1997, Earnhardt went winless for only the second time in his career. The only (non-points) win came during Speedweeks at Daytona in the Twin 125-mile qualifying race, his record eighth-straight win in the event. Once again in the hunt for the Daytona 500 with 10 laps to go, Earnhardt was taken out of contention by a late crash which sent his car upside down on the backstretch. He hit the low point of his year when he blacked out early in the Mountain Dew Southern 500 at Darlington in September, causing him to hit the wall. Afterward, he was disoriented, and it took several laps before he could find his pit stall. When asked, Earnhardt complained of double vision which made it difficult to pit. Mike Dillon (Richard Childress's son-in-law) was brought in to relieve Earnhardt for the remainder of the race. Earnhardt was evaluated at a local hospital and cleared to race the next week, but the cause of the blackout and double vision was never determined. Despite no wins, Earnhardt finished the season fifth in the final standings with 7 top fives and 16 top tens, with an average finish of 12.1.\nOn February 15, 1998, Earnhardt finally won the Daytona 500 in his 20th attempt after failing to win in his previous 19 attempts. He began the season by winning his Twin 125-mile qualifier race for the ninth straight year, and the week before was the first to drive around the track under the newly installed lights, for coincidentally 20 laps. On race day, he showed himself to be a contender early. Halfway through the race, however, it seemed that Jeff Gordon had the upper hand. But by lap 138, Earnhardt had taken the lead and thanks to a push by teammate Mike Skinner, he maintained it. Earnhardt made it to the caution-checkered flag before Bobby Labonte. Afterwards, there was a large show of respect for Earnhardt, in which every crew member of every team lined pit road to shake his hand as he made his way to victory lane. Earnhardt then drove his No. 3 into the infield grass, starting a trend of post-race celebrations. He spun the car twice, throwing grass and leaving tire tracks in the shape of a No. 3 in the grass. He then spoke about the victory, saying, \"I have had a lot of great fans and people behind me all through the years and I just can't thank them enough. The Daytona 500 is ours. We won it, we won it, we won it!\" The rest of the season did not go as well, and the Daytona 500 was his only victory that year. Despite that, he did almost pull off a Daytona sweep, where he was one of the contenders for the win in the first nighttime Pepsi 400, but a pit stop late in the race in which a rogue tire cost him the race win. He slipped to 12th in the point standings halfway through the season, and Richard Childress decided to make a crew chief change, taking Mike Skinner's crew chief Kevin Hamlin and putting him with Earnhardt while giving Skinner Larry McReynolds (Earnhardt's crew chief). Earnhardt finished the 1998 season eighth in the final points standings, with 1 win, 5 top fives, and 13 top tens, with an average finish of 16.2.\nBefore the 1999 season, fans began discussing Earnhardt's age and speculating that with his son, Dale Jr., making his Winston Cup debut, Earnhardt might be contemplating retirement. Earnhardt swept both races for the year at Talladega, leading some to conclude that his talent had become limited to the restrictor plate tracks, which require a unique skill set and an exceptionally powerful racecar to win. But halfway through the year, Earnhardt began to show some of the old spark. In the August race at Michigan, he led laps late in the race and nearly pulled off his first win on a non-restrictor-plate track since 1996. One week later, he provided NASCAR with one of its most controversial moments. At the Bristol night race, Earnhardt found himself in contention to win his first short track race since Martinsville in 1995. When a caution came out with 15 laps to go, leader Terry Labonte got hit from behind by the lapped car of Darrell Waltrip. His spin put Earnhardt in the lead with five cars between him and Labonte with five laps to go. Labonte had four fresh tires, and Earnhardt was driving on old tires, which made Earnhardt's car considerably slower. Labonte caught Earnhardt and passed him coming to the white flag, but Earnhardt drove hard into turn two, bumping Labonte and spinning him around. Earnhardt collected the win while spectators booed and made obscene gestures. \"I didn't mean to turn him around, I just wanted to rattle his cage,\" Earnhardt said of the incident. He finished seventh in the standings that year, with 3 wins, 7 top fives, and 21 top tens, with an average finish of 12.0.\n2000.\nIn the 2000 season, Earnhardt had a resurgence, which was commonly attributed to neck surgery he underwent to correct a lingering injury from his 1996 Talladega crash. He scored what were considered the two most exciting wins of the year\u2014winning by 0.010 seconds over Bobby Labonte at Atlanta, then gaining seventeen positions in the final four laps to win at Talladega, claiming his only No Bull million-dollar bonus along with his record 10th win at the track. Earnhardt also had second-place runs at Richmond and Martinsville, tracks where he had struggled through the late 1990s. On the strength of those performances, Earnhardt got to second in the standings. However, poor performances at the road course of Watkins Glen, where he wrecked coming out of the chicane, a wreck with Kenny Irwin Jr. while leading the spring race at Bristol, and mid-pack runs at intermediate tracks like Charlotte and Dover in a season dominated by the Ford Taurus in those tracks from Roush, Yates, and Penske, coupled with Bobby Labonte's extreme consistency, denied Earnhardt an eighth championship title. Earnhardt finished 2000 with two wins, 13 top fives, 24 top tens, an average finish of 9.4, and was the only driver besides Labonte to finish the season with zero DNF's.\nDeath.\nDuring the Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway on February 18, 2001, Earnhardt was killed in a three-car crash on the final lap of the race. He collided with Ken Schrader after making small contact with Sterling Marlin and hit the outside wall head-on. He had been blocking Schrader on the outside and Marlin on the inside at the time of the crash. Earnhardt's and Schrader's cars both slid off the track's asphalt banking into the infield grass just inside of turn 4. Seconds later, his driver Michael Waltrip won the race, with Michael's teammate and his son Dale Earnhardt Jr. finishing second. Earnhardt was pronounced dead at the Halifax Medical Center at 5:16\u00a0pm Eastern Standard Time (22:16 UTC); he was 49 years old. NASCAR president Mike Helton confirmed Earnhardt's death in a statement to the press. An autopsy conducted on February 19, 2001, concluded that Earnhardt sustained a fatal basilar skull fracture. Four days later, on February 22, public funeral services for Earnhardt were held at the Calvary Church in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nAftermath.\nAfter Earnhardt's death, two investigations led by the Daytona Beach Police Department and NASCAR commenced; nearly every detail of the crash was made public. The allegations of seatbelt failure resulted in Bill Simpson's resignation from the company bearing his name, which manufactured the seatbelts used in Earnhardt's car and nearly every other NASCAR driver's car. NASCAR implemented rigorous safety improvements, such as mandating the HANS device, which Earnhardt refused to wear after finding it restrictive and uncomfortable. Several press conferences were held in the days following Earnhardt's death. After driver Sterling Marlin and his relatives received hate mail and death threats from angry fans, Waltrip and Earnhardt Jr. absolved him of any responsibility. Richard Childress made a public pledge that the number 3 would never again adorn the side of a black race car with a GM Goodwrench sponsorship. The number returned for the 2014 season, this time not sponsored by GM Goodwrench (which was rebranded GM Certified Service in 2011), driven by Childress's grandson Austin Dillon.\nAt this time, his team was re-christened as the No. 29 team. Childress's second-year Busch Series driver Kevin Harvick was named as Earnhardt's replacement, beginning with the 2001 Dura Lube 400 at North Carolina Speedway. Special pennants bearing the No. 3 were distributed to everyone at the track to honor Earnhardt, and the Childress team wore blank uniforms out of respect, something which disappeared quickly and was soon replaced by the previous GM Goodwrench Service Plus uniforms. Harvick's car always displayed the Earnhardt stylized number 3 on the \"B\" posts (metal portion on each side of the car to the rear of the front windows) above the number 29 until the end of 2013, when he departed for Stewart-Haas Racing.\nFans began honoring Earnhardt by holding three fingers aloft on the third lap of every race, a black screen of No. 3 in the beginning of \"NASCAR Thunder 2002\" before the EA Sports logo, and the television coverage of \"NASCAR on Fox\" and \"NASCAR on NBC\" went silent for each third lap from Rockingham to the following year's race there in honor of Earnhardt, unless on-track incidents brought out the caution flag on the third lap. Three weeks after Earnhardt's death, Harvick, driving a car that had been prepared for Earnhardt, scored his first career Cup win at Atlanta. On the final lap of the 2001 Cracker Barrel Old Country Store 500, he beat Jeff Gordon by .006 seconds (the margin being 0.004 of a second closer than Earnhardt had won over Bobby Labonte at the same race a year ago) in an identical photo finish, and the images of Earnhardt's longtime gas man Danny \"Chocolate\" Myers crying after the victory, Harvick's tire-smoking burnout on the front stretch with three fingers held aloft outside the driver's window. Harvick would win another race at the inaugural event at Chicagoland en route to a ninth-place finish in the final points and won Rookie of the Year honors along with the 2001 NASCAR Busch Series Championship.\nDale Earnhardt, Inc. won five races in the 2001 season, beginning with Steve Park's victory in the race at Rockingham just one week after Earnhardt's death. Earnhardt Jr. and Waltrip finished first and second in the series' return to Daytona in July for the Pepsi 400, a reverse of the finish in the Daytona 500. Earnhardt Jr. also won the fall races at Dover (first post 9/11 race) and Talladega and came to an eighth-place points finish.\nEarnhardt's remains were interred at his estate in Mooresville, North Carolina after a private funeral service on February 21, 2001.\nNo. 3 car.\nEarnhardt drove the No. 3 car for the majority of his career, spanning the latter half of the 1981 season, and then again from 1984 until he died in 2001. Although he had other sponsors during his career, his No. 3 is associated in fans' minds with his last sponsor GM Goodwrench and his last color scheme\u00a0\u2014 a predominantly black car with bold red and silver trim. The black and red No. 3 continues to be one of the most famous logos in North American motor racing.\nA common misconception was that Richard Childress Racing \"owned the rights\" to the No. 3 in NASCAR competition (fueled by the fact that Kevin Harvick's car had a little No. 3 as an homage to Earnhardt from 2001 to 2013 and the usage of the No. 3 on the Camping World Truck Series truck of Ty Dillon when he ran in that series), but NASCAR, and no specific team, owns the rights to this or any other number. According to established NASCAR procedures, Richard Childress Racing had priority over other teams if they chose to reuse the number, which they did when Austin Dillon was promoted to the Cup series in 2014. While Richard Childress Racing owns the stylized No. 3 logos used during Earnhardt's lifetime (and used presently with Dillon), those rights would hypothetically not prevent a future racing team from using a different No. 3 design (also, a new No. 3 team would most likely, in any case, need to create logos which fit with their sponsor's logos).\nIn 2004, ESPN released a made-for-TV movie entitled \"\", which used a new (but similarly colored) No. 3 logo. The movie was a sympathetic portrayal of Earnhardt's life, but the producers were sued for using the No. 3 logo. In December 2006, the ESPN lawsuit was settled, but details were not released to the public.\nDale Earnhardt Jr. made two special appearances in 2002 in a No. 3 Busch Series car: these appearances were at the track where his father died (Daytona) and the track where he made his first Winston Cup start (Charlotte). Earnhardt Jr. won the first of those two races, which was the season-opening event at Daytona. He also raced a No. 3 sponsored by Wrangler on July 2, 2010, for Richard Childress Racing at Daytona. In a green-white-checker finish he outran Joey Logano to win his second race in the No. 3.\nOtherwise, the No. 3 was missing from the national touring series until September 5, 2009, when Austin Dillon, the 19-year-old grandson of Richard Childress, debuted an RCR-owned No. 3 truck in the Camping World Truck Series. Dillon and his younger brother Ty Dillon drove the No. 3 in various lower level competitions for several years, including the Camping World East Series. In 2012, Austin Dillon began driving in the Nationwide Series full-time, using the No. 3; he had previously used the No. 33 while driving in that series part-time.\nRichard Childress Racing entered a No. 3 in the Daytona truck race on February 13, 2010, with sponsorship from Bass Pro Shops driven by Austin Dillon. It was involved in a wreck almost identical to that which took the life of Earnhardt: being spun out, colliding with another vehicle, and being turned into the outside wall in turn number four. Dillon again returned to a No. 3 marked racecar when he started fifth in the 2012 Daytona Nationwide Series opener in an Advocare-sponsored black Chevrolet Impala. On December 11, 2013, RCR announced that Austin Dillon would drive the No. 3 car in the upcoming 2014 Sprint Cup season, bringing the number back to the series for the first time in 13 years.\nOnly the former International Race of Champions actually retired the No. 3, which they did in a rule change effective in 2004. Until the series folded in 2007, anyone wishing to use the No. 3 again had to use No. 03 instead.\nFormula One driver Daniel Ricciardo chose the number 3 as his permanent racing number when F1's rules changed to allow drivers to choose their own numbers for 2014 and stated on Twitter that part of the reason for his choice was that he was a fan of Earnhardt's, while his helmet design features the number stylized in the same way.\nLegacy.\n\"Earnhardt Tower\", a seating section at Daytona International Speedway was opened and named in his honor a month before his death at the track.\nEarnhardt has several roads named after him, including a street in his hometown Kannapolis. Dale Earnhardt Boulevard (originally Earnhardt Road) is marked as exit\u00a060 off Interstate 85, northeast of Charlotte. Dale Earnhardt Drive is also the start of The Dale Journey Trail, a self-guided driving tour of landmarks in the lives of Earnhardt and his family. The North Carolina Department of Transportation switched the designation of a road between Kannapolis and Mooresville near the headquarters of DEI (that used to be called NC 136) with NC 3, which was in Currituck County. In addition, exit\u00a072 off Interstate 35W, one of the entrances to Texas Motor Speedway, is named \"Dale Earnhardt Way\".\nBetween the 2004 and 2005 JGTC (renamed Super GT from 2005) season, Hasemi Sport competed in the series with a sole black G'Zox-sponsored Nissan 350Z with the same number and letterset as Earnhardt on the roof.\nDuring the NASCAR weekend races at Talladega Superspeedway on April 29, 2006\u00a0\u2013 May 1, 2006, the DEI cars competed in identical special black paint schemes on Dale Earnhardt Day, which is held annually on his birthday\u2014April 29. Martin Truex Jr., won the Aaron's 312 in the black car, painted to reflect Earnhardt's Intimidating Black No. 3 NASCAR Busch Grand National series car. In the Nextel Cup race on May 1, No. 8 Dale Earnhardt Jr.; No. 1 Martin Truex Jr.; and No. 15 Paul Menard competed in cars with the same type of paint scheme.\nOn June 18, 2006, at Michigan for the 3M Performance 400, Earnhardt Jr. ran a special vintage Budweiser car to honor his father and his grandfather Ralph Earnhardt. He finished third after rain caused the race to be cut short. The car was painted to resemble Ralph's 1956 dirt cars, and carried 1956-era Budweiser logos to complete the throwback look.\nIn the summer of 2007, Dale Earnhardt, Inc. (DEI) with the Dale Earnhardt Foundation, announced it will fund an annual undergraduate scholarship at Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina, for students interested in motorsports and automotive engineering. Scholarship winners are also eligible to work at DEI in internships. The first winner was William Bostic, a senior at Clemson majoring in mechanical engineering.\nIn 2008, on the 50th anniversary of the first Daytona 500 race, DEI and RCR teamed up to make a special COT sporting Earnhardt's 1998 Daytona 500 paint scheme to honor the tenth anniversary of his Daytona 500 victory. In a tribute to all previous Daytona 500 winners, the winning drivers appeared in a lineup on stage, in chronological order. The throwback No. 3 car stood in the infield, in the approximate position Earnhardt would have taken in the processional. The throwback car featured the authentic 1998-era design on a current-era car, a concept similar to modern throwback jerseys in other sports. The car was later sold in 1:64 and 1:24 scale models.\nIn 2010, the Intimidator 305 roller coaster opened at Kings Dominion in Doswell, Virginia. Named after Earnhardt, the ride's trains were modeled after his black-and-red Chevrolet. Another Intimidator coaster also opened at Carowinds in North Carolina the same year. Both were themed to Earnhardt's legacy, featuring signs, flags, various artwork, as well as replicas of the cars he drove at each location. The \"Intimidator\" name and all Earnhardt branding were removed from both rides in 2024 as a result of an expiring licensing agreement.\nAtlanta Braves assistant coach Ned Yost was a friend of Earnhardt, and Richard Childress. When Yost was named Milwaukee Brewers manager, he changed jersey numbers, from No. 5 to No. 3 in Earnhardt's honor. (No. 3 is retired by the Braves in honor of outfielder Dale Murphy, so Yost could not make the change while in Atlanta.) When Yost was named Kansas City Royals assistant coach, he wore No. 2 for the 2010 season, even when he was named manager in May 2010, but for the 2011 season, he switched back to No. 3.\nDuring the third lap of the 2011 Daytona 500 (a decade since Earnhardt's death), and 2021 Daytona 500 (two decades since Earnhardt's death) the commentators on FOX fell silent while fans raised three fingers in a similar fashion to the tributes throughout 2001.\nThe north entrance to New Avondale City Center in Arizona will bear the name Dale Earnhardt Drive. Avondale is where Earnhardt won a Cup race in 1990.\nHis helmet from the 1998 season is at the National Museum of American History in the Smithsonian museum in Washington D.C.\nWeedeater, a sludge metal band from North Carolina, paid tribute to Earnhardt on their 2003 album \"Sixteen Tons\", with the song \"No. 3\". The song is played with audio clips from television broadcasts about Earnhardt mixed in the background. He is also mentioned in a 2001 song composed by John Hiatt entitled \"The Tiki Bar Is Open,\" along with his legendary race number.\nOn February 28, 2016, after winning the Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, during his victory lap, driver Jimmie Johnson held his hand out of his window, with three fingers extended in tribute to Earnhardt. This was following Johnson's 76th Cup Series win, which tied the career mark of Earnhardt's. This is also the track where Earnhardt claimed his sixth Winston Cup Series title.\nIn the week of the 2021 United States Grand Prix, McLaren driver Daniel Ricciardo drove the iconic Wrangler car from 1984 as Ricciardo has been a fan of Earnhardt since he was a child. The opportunity came after he won the Italian Grand Prix that year, and McLaren CEO Zak Brown, who owns the car, promised him that he would give him a chance to drive it.\nA star is named after him through International Star Registry. The star, officially named \"Dale Earnhardt, Sr.,\" is located in the Aquila constellation at coordinates RA 19h 1m 36.36s D 16\u00b0 34\u2032 25.00\u2033.\nMedia.\nEarnhardt appeared as himself in the movie, \"Stroker Ace\".\nHe also voiced himself in \"King of the Hill\" in the episode titled, \"Life in the Fast Lane, Bobby's Saga\"."}

Loosely following the story of the 1965 Frank Herbert novel \"Dune\" and using many visual elements from the 1984 film of the same name by David Lynch, the game casts the player as Paul Atreides, with the ultimate goal of driving the Harkonnens from the planet Dune and taking control of its valuable export, the spice. Key to success is the management of spice mining, military forces, and ecology as the player amasses allies and skills. One aspect of the game allows the player to terraform Arrakis from a desert into a fertile and green planet, at the cost of sandworm habitat and reduced melange spice production.\n\"Dune II\" (1992).\n\"Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty\", later retitled \"Dune II: Battle for Arrakis\" for the European release and the Mega Drive/Genesis port, was released in December 1992 from Westwood Studios/Virgin Interactive. Often considered to be the first \"mainstream modern real-time strategy game\", \"Dune II\" established many conventions of the genre. Only loosely connected to the plot of the novels or films, the game pits three interplanetary houses \u2014 the Atreides, the Harkonnens, and the Ordos \u2014 against each other for control of the planet Arrakis and its valuable spice, all while fending off the destructive natural forces of the harsh desert planet itself.\n\"Dune 2000\" (1998).\n\"Dune 2000\", a 1998 remake of \"Dune II\" from Intelligent Games/Westwood Studios/Virgin Interactive, added improved graphics and live-action cutscenes.

The game was not a commercial or critical success, and Cryo subsequently filed for bankruptcy in July 2002.\n\"Dune Generations\" (2001, cancelled).\nIn 2001, Cryonetworks disclosed information about \"Dune Generations\", an online, 3D real-time strategy game set in the \"Dune\" universe. An official website for the upcoming game featured concept images, a brief background story and description of the persistent gameworld, and a list of frequently asked questions. The game would be constructed using Cryo's own online multimedia development framework SCOL.\nWithin \"the infrastructure of a permanent and massive multiplayer world that exists online\", \"Dune Generations\" would let players assume control of a dynasty in the \"Dune\" universe, with the goal of first mastering the natural resources of their own homeworlds and ultimately rising in power and influence through conflicts and alliances with other player dynasties. Each of the three available dynasty types - traders, soldiers, or mercenaries - would provide a different playing experience, all with the long-term goal of gaining control of Arrakis and its valuable spice.\nA preview video trailer was released in November 2001. The game was still in the alpha testing stage in February 2002, and the project was ultimately halted after Cryo filed for bankruptcy in July.\n\"Dune: Ornithopter Assault\" (2002, cancelled).\n\"Dune: Ornithopter Assault\" was developed by Hungarian studio Soft Brigade 2 for the Game Boy Advance, but was cancelled in 2002.

The series spans 5,000 years, focusing on Paul and then his various descendants.\n\"Dune\" was adapted as a 1984 film, and again in two parts, the films \"Dune\" (2021) and \"\" (2024). Additionally, the novel was adapted as a 2000 television miniseries, \"Frank Herbert's Dune\", and the first two sequels were also adapted as a single miniseries, \"Frank Herbert's Children of Dune\", in 2003.\nSince 1999, Frank Herbert's son Brian Herbert and science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson have published 15 prequel novels, collected in the series \"Prelude to Dune\" (1999\u20132001), \"Legends of Dune\" (2002\u20132004), \"Heroes of Dune\" (2008\u20132023), \"Great Schools of Dune\" (2012\u20132016), and \"The Caladan Trilogy\" (2020\u20132022). They have also released two sequel novels\u2014\"Hunters of Dune\" (2006) and \"Sandworms of Dune\" (2007)\u2014which complete the original series.\nIntroduced in \"Dune\" (1965).\nPaul Atreides.\nIn \"Dune\", Paul is the teenage son and heir of Duke Leto Atreides and Lady Jessica, whose family is thrown into the dangerous political intrigues centered on the inhospitable desert planet Arrakis, only known source of the oracular spice melange, the most important and valuable substance in the universe. Paul has been trained by his father and several Atreides attendants in fighting and the art of war, and by his mother in some of her Bene Gesserit disciplines. Paul also possesses burgeoning prescient abilities, which are further unlocked by the inescapable exposure to melange on Arrakis. House Atreides is soon betrayed and scattered, with Leto killed, his forces devastated, and Paul and Jessica forced to flee into the open desert. They are taken in by the native Fremen, a secretive population of fierce fighters who thrive despite the scarcity of water and presence of aggressive, giant sandworms. Paul rises to lead the planetwide Fremen forces against the Imperial stranglehold over Arrakis, ultimately seizing control of the planet and deposing Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV. In \"Dune Messiah\", Paul's empire is challenged by the conspiracies of various factions hoping to destroy him, while a jihad in his name rages across the universe. After he is blinded by a devastating weapon known as a stone burner, Paul exiles himself into the desert, per Fremen custom. Paul returns under the guise of \"The Preacher\" in \"Children of Dune,\" rallying against the Fremen religion and the jihad raging in his name. The Preacher is ultimately assassinated by one of Alia's guards after calling her a blasphemer. \nPaul is portrayed by Kyle MacLachlan in the 1984 film adaptation \"Dune\", and by Alec Newman in the 2000 miniseries \"Frank Herbert's Dune\" and its 2003 sequel, \"Frank Herbert's Children of Dune\". The character is played by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet in the 2021 film \"Dune\" and its sequel, \"\" (2024).\nLady Jessica.\nIn \"Dune\", Lady Jessica is the concubine of Duke Leto and the mother of his son Paul and daughter Alia. Jessica is one of the Bene Gesserit, a secretive, matriarchal order who achieve superhuman abilities through physical and mental conditioning and the use of the drug melange. Instructed by the Bene Gesserit to first conceive a daughter with Leto to further the order's centuries-long breeding program, she disobeyed out of love for Leto, and gave him a son. This seemingly minor misstep puts the Atreides bloodline on a collision course with events that will ultimately change the fate of the universe. Pregnant with Alia, Jessica flees into the desert with Paul as House Atreides is all but destroyed by the forces of the wicked Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. Finding refuge with the native Fremen, she and Paul take advantage of the legends planted there by Bene Gesserit religious engineering, casting themselves as the prophesied messiah and his mother. Jessica undergoes the Fremen version of the Bene Gesserit spice agony ritual, becoming a Reverend Mother and unlocking Other Memory, the personas and memories of all her female ancestors. But doing so while pregnant subjects the unborn Alia to an onslaught of heightened awareness for which her fragile consciousness is not prepared. Jessica returns to Arrakis in \"Children of Dune\" and recognizes that Alia, who serves as regent for Paul and Chani's twin children, Leto II and Ghanima, has succumbed to the dangers of her unique birth and become possessed. Jessica escapes an assassination attempt by Alia, and trains Farad'n, the grandson of Shaddam IV, in the Bene Gesserit way.\nLady Jessica is portrayed by Francesca Annis in the 1984 film. Saskia Reeves plays the role in the 2000 miniseries, and is succeeded by Alice Krige in its 2003 sequel. Rebecca Ferguson portrays Jessica in the 2021 film and its 2024 sequel.\nLeto I Atreides.\nDuke Leto Atreides is the planetary governor of the ocean planet Caladan who takes over the lucrative spice mining operations on the desert planet Arrakis at the behest of the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV. Knowing it is some kind of trap but unable to refuse the assignment, Leto proactively seeks an alliance with the native Fremen, people tempered by the planet's harsh conditions who Leto realizes are an underestimated and untapped resource. He is accompanied to Arrakis by his Bene Gesserit concubine Lady Jessica, with whom he is in love but has not married to allow for the possibility of a politically advantageous marriage, and his son and heir, Paul. Threatened by Leto's growing influence among the Landsraad assembly of noble families, Shaddam has aligned himself with Leto's enemy, the Baron Harkonnen. The Harkonnens, secretly bolstered by Shaddam's fierce Sardaukar warriors and aided by Leto's own personal physician, the Suk doctor Wellington Yueh, launch an attack that devastates the Atreides forces. Leto is taken prisoner by the Baron, and dies attempting to kill him.\nThe character has been described as \"regal and doomed\", and \"warmly protective but all-too-vulnerable\".\nLeto is portrayed by J\u00fcrgen Prochnow in the 1984 film. Ben Sherlock of \"Screen Rant\" called Prochnow \"mesmerizing\" in the role, with \"a commanding screen presence\" that \"brought slightly more grit\" than subsequent portrayals. William Hurt plays Leto in the 2000 miniseries. Hurt was the first actor to be cast in the 2000 adaptation. A fan of the novel, he told \"The New York Times\", \"I was a science fiction junkie ... [Director John Harrison] captured Herbert's prophetic reflection of our own age, where nation-states are competing with the new global economy and its corporate elements.\" Emmet Asher-Perrin of \"Tor.com\" wrote that Hurt \"brings a certain reserved calm that works for the character.\" Leto is portrayed by Oscar Isaac in the 2021 film. Chaim Gartenberg of \"The Verge\" wrote, \"Isaac exudes a sense of righteous honor, and it\u2019s easy to see both why his men would follow him to a forsaken desert world and why he falls so thoroughly into the political traps.\"\nIn 2020, Funko produced a Duke Leto figure as part of their POP! Television line. It is a vinyl figure in the Japanese chibi style, depicting Leto in armor and styled after the 2021 Denis Villeneuve film.\nLeto is also a primary character in the prequel trilogies \"Prelude to Dune\" and \"The Caladan Trilogy\" by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. In \"Prelude to Dune\", young Leto's mother, Helena, arranges for his father, expert bullfighter Duke Paulus Atreides, to be killed by a drugged Salusan bull so she can rule Caladan as Leto's regent. He exiles his mother to a distant convent to avoid the scandal of a public execution, and as duke takes Kailea Vernius of the industrial planet Ix as his concubine. They have a son, Victor, but grow apart, and Kailea's resentment and insecurities build. Threatened by Leto's attraction to the Bene Gesserit acolyte Jessica, Kailea attempts to kill him, but in the ensuing accident her brother Rhombur is critically injured and Victor is killed. Kailea commits suicide, and Leto takes Jessica as his concubine. Though instructed by the Bene Gesserit to bear the mourning Leto a daughter, Jessica intentionally conceives the son he desires, Paul. Leto surrounds himself with loyal and capable individuals, and comes to be known as an effective politician, a fair and just statesman, and a capable leader of his small military. The new Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV, both admires Leto and dislikes him as a political rival. Leto's military victory over the Tleilaxu forces occupying Ix, and his role in the subsequent political censure of Shaddam, ensure Leto a vengeful enemy in the emperor.\nVladimir Harkonnen.\nBaron Vladimir Harkonnen is the ruthless and cunning head of House Harkonnen, centuries-old enemies of House Atreides. The Baron's intent to exterminate the Atreides line seems close to fruition as Duke Leto is lured to Arrakis on the pretense of taking over the lucrative spice mining operation there, previously controlled by the Harkonnens. The Baron has coerced Leto's own physician, the trusted Suk doctor Wellington Yueh, to be his agent in the Atreides household. Yueh disables the protective shields around the Atreides palace and the Harkonnen forces (secretly supplemented by the seemingly unstoppable Imperial Sardaukar warriors) attack. Yueh gives a captive Leto the means to assassinate the Baron, who survives the attempt as Leto dies. Escaping into the desert and later presumed dead, Leto's son Paul reveals to his mother, Lady Jessica, that the Baron is her father. The Baron's succession plan is to install his charismatic yet deadly younger nephew, Feyd-Rautha, as ruler of Arrakis after a period of tyrannical misrule by his brutish elder nephew, Glossu Rabban, making Feyd appear to be the savior of the people. A crisis on Arrakis begins when the mysterious Muad'Dib emerges as a leader of the native Fremen tribes, uniting them against Harkonnen rule. Eventually, a series of Fremen victories against Rabban threaten to disrupt the trade of the spice, attracting the attention of Shaddam IV himself. The emperor arrives on Arrakis with several legions of his Sardaukar, and he and the Baron are shocked to discover that the Fremen warlord Muad'Dib is actually Paul Atreides. The Fremen, previously underestimated by the Harkonnens, overcome the Imperial and Harkonnen forces thanks to Paul's military strategy, their own ferocity and their ability to use sandstorms and the giant sandworms of Arrakis to their advantage. Paul's sister Alia, four years old but born a fully aware Fremen Reverend Mother, reveals to the Baron that he is her grandfather before she kills him with a poisoned needle called a gom jabbar.\nIn \"Children of Dune\", Alia succumbs to the dangers of her unique birth and is possessed by the persona of the deceased Baron Harkonnen. As he promises his assistance in quelling the multitude of other ancestral voices assailing her, Alia gradually relinquishes control of herself to the Baron, and descends into depravity and a lust for power sure to destroy the Atreides empire from within. Eventually realizing that the Baron's consciousness has surpassed her abilities to contain him, Alia commits suicide, killing the Baron in the process.\nBaron Harkonnen is portrayed by Kenneth McMillan in the 1984 film, and by Ian McNeice in the 2000 miniseries and its 2003 sequel. Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd portrays the character in the 2021 film and its 2024 sequel.\nChani.\nChani is the daughter of Liet-Kynes, the Imperial Planetologist on Arrakis, and his Fremen wife Faroula. In \"Dune\", Paul Atreides sees Chani in his prescient dreams before his family moves from Caladan to Arrakis. Later, Paul and his mother Jessica flee the Harkonnen attack that kills his father and devastates the Atreides forces, and are reluctantly taken in by a tribe of the planet's native desert people, the Fremen. Chani, a fierce warrior, is assigned to protect and guide Paul in the Fremen ways. They soon become lovers, and Paul, now known as Muad'Dib, rises as a military and religious leader among the Fremen. Their rebellion against the Harkonnens intensifies, and Paul and Chani's infant son is murdered in a Sardaukar raid. The Fremen overcome the Imperial and Harkonnen forces thanks to Paul's military strategy, their own ferocity and their ability to use sandstorms and the giant sandworms of Arrakis to their advantage. With his absolute control over Arrakis and the spice, Paul deposes Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, marrying his daughter Princess Irulan to secure the throne. He vows that Chani will always be his only love, and mother of his children.\nTwelve years later in \"Dune Messiah\", Paul and Chani remain childless. Irulan, Bene Gesserit-trained and doing their bidding, has been secretly feeding Chani contraceptives to prevent her from conceiving an Imperial heir. The Sisterhood are desperate to regain control of Paul's bloodline for their breeding program, and are fearful of the effect Chani's \"wild\" genes may have on their offspring. But when Chani begins an ancient Fremen fertility diet high in melange, Irulan loses her ability to interfere, and Chani becomes pregnant. Chani ultimately discovers not only Irulan's role in her infertility but the fact that the contraceptives have caused permanent damage and will jeopardize her pregnancy. Chani seeks to kill Irulan, but Paul forbids it. He is secretly somewhat grateful to Irulan, as he has seen through his prescience that childbirth will bring Chani's death, and so Irulan has unwittingly extended Chani's life. Chani dies after giving birth to Paul's twin children, Leto II and Ghanima. Having proven their ability to do so, the Tleilaxu offer to resurrect Chani as a ghola in exchange for control of the empire, but Paul refuses. Through his oracular sight, Paul has seen that Chani's death during childbirth is far less painful and cruel than her possible future fates had she survived.\nChani is portrayed by actress Sean Young in the 1984 film, and by Barbora Kodetov\u00e1 in the 2000 miniseries and its 2003 sequel. Zendaya portrays the character in the 2021 film and its 2024 sequel.\nStilgar.\nStilgar is the Fremen leader, or naib, of Sietch Tabr. In \"Dune\", Duke Leto Atreides sends his swordmaster, Duncan Idaho, to build a relationship with the mysterious native Fremen of Arrakis, people tempered by the planet's harsh conditions who Leto realizes are an underestimated and untapped resource. Leto allows Duncan, impressed with the Fremen and their ways, a dual loyalty to both the Atreides and Stilgar. When Leto's son Paul and his Bene Gesserit mother, Lady Jessica, flee a Harkonnen attack, they find refuge with Stilgar's tribe of Fremen. Paul, believed to be their prophesied messiah, comes to be known as Muad'Dib and rises as a military and religious leader among the Fremen. \nPreviously underestimated by the Harkonnens, the Fremen overcome the Imperial and Harkonnen forces that control Arrakis thanks to Paul's military strategy, their own ferocity and their ability to use sandstorms and the giant sandworms to their advantage. In \"Dune Messiah\", Stilgar is a staunch supporter and protector of Paul, and one of his inner circle of advisors. In \"Children of Dune\", Stilgar is fiercely loyal to Paul's young heirs Leto II and Ghanima, and is conflicted as the regent, Paul's sister Alia, descends into madness. Duncan manipulates Stilgar into killing him, knowing it will force Stilgar to join the rebellion against Alia. Later, with Leto presumed dead, Stilgar helps Ghanima and Princess Irulan escape Alia's tyranny.\nNovelist Brian Herbert, Frank Herbert's son and biographer, wrote, \"One time I asked my father if he identified with any of the characters in his stories, and to my surprise he said it was Stilgar, the rugged leader of the Fremen... Mulling this over, I realized Stilgar was the equivalent of a Native American chief in \"Dune\"\u2014a person who represented and defended time-honored ways that did not harm the ecology of the planet.\"\nStilgar is portrayed by Everett McGill in the 1984 film. Uwe Ochsenknecht plays the role in the 2000 miniseries, and is succeeded by Steven Berkoff in its 2003 sequel. Asher-Perrin called Ochsenknecht \"a wonderfully gruff Stilgar\", but later wrote, \"Steven Berkoff is an incredible character actor, but there is nothing about him that even remotely invokes the old Fremen leader. Instead, he reads at the beginning like the Atreides family butler before moving onto Old British Wardog Supreme.\" Javier Bardem portrays Stilgar in the 2021 film and its 2024 sequel.\nIn 1984, toy company LJN released a line of \"Dune\" action figures, styled after David Lynch's film, which included a figure of Stilgar. McFarlane Toys released a 7\" articulating action figure of Stilgar in 2020, styled after the 2021 Denis Villeneuve film. In 2022, Super7 released a 3.75\" articulating Stilgar action figure as part of its \"Dune\" ReAction line, also styled after the Lynch film.\nStilgar's early life is explored in the \"Prelude to Dune\" prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, and he is resurrected as a ghola in the Brian Herbert/Anderson conclusion to the original series, \"Sandworms of Dune\". The character also appears in the prequel novels \"Paul of Dune\" and \"The Winds of Dune\".\nDuncan Idaho.\nDuncan Idaho is the Swordmaster of House Atreides, and one of Paul's teachers. In \"Dune\", Leto sends Duncan to build a relationship with the mysterious native Fremen of Arrakis, people tempered by the planet's harsh conditions who Leto realizes are an underestimated and untapped resource. Leto allows Duncan, impressed with the Fremen and their ways, a dual loyalty to both the Atreides and Stilgar, but he is later killed helping Paul and Jessica escape from the Harkonnens. Duncan is revived by the Bene Tleilax as the ghola Mentat Hayt in \"Dune Messiah\", and works with Paul's sister Alia to unravel the conspiracy against the Atreides. The Tleilaxu have secretly programmed Hayt to seduce Alia, weaken Paul psychologically and then kill him. The trauma of the attempt restores his memories of being Duncan. He is married to Alia in \"Children of Dune\", but she has succumbed to the dangers of her unique birth and become possessed by the persona of the deceased Baron Harkonnen. As Alia becomes more power-hungry and attempts to assassinate her mother Jessica, Duncan spirits Jessica and Paul's children Leto II and Ghanima away. He manipulates Fremen naib Stilgar, a loyal Atreides advisor, into killing him, knowing that the act will force Stilgar to join the rebellion against Alia or be executed by her out of political necessity.\nThirty-five hundred years later in \"God Emperor of Dune\", a series of Duncan gholas provided by the Tleilaxu have served the seemingly immortal God Emperor Leto II Atreides one after the other. Most of these have been killed by Leto himself, as the serial Duncans, pledged to the Atreides in a time when justice reigned, tend to rebel against the hallmark tyranny and oppression of Leto's rule. The newest Duncan is as disillusioned as his predecessors, and after falling in love with the Ixian ambassador Hwi Noree (who is engaged to Leto), he joins Atreides descendant Siona in her plot to assassinate Leto. He allows them to succeed, and as he dies, Leto reveals that his millennia-long plan for humanity's ultimate survival\u2014called the Golden Path\u2014has come to fruition. Siona and her descendants will be invisible to prescient sight, and the end of his millennia of oppression will spark a mass diaspora of humankind which will come to be known as The Scattering.\nFifteen hundred years later, the Bene Gesserit become the consumers of Duncan gholas in \"Heretics of Dune\" and \"Chapterhouse Dune\". The Sisterhood suspect that the Tleilaxu have implanted the gholas with some secret purpose, and when latest Duncan regains his memories, he agrees. The Honored Matres, a violent matriarchal order with the ability to enslave men using their unique sexual talents, have arrived from the farthest reaches of the universe, wreaking havoc and destruction, and obliterating Tleilaxu worlds. An attempt by the Honored Matre Murbella to sexually imprint Duncan triggers the hidden Tleilaxu purpose: to conquer the Honored Matres by using a better version of their own sexual techniques. All the memories of the previous Duncans are unlocked in the current one as he and Murbella imprint each other. Addicted to each other, they are confined to a no-ship on the Bene Gesserit homeworld, Chapterhouse. There, Duncan trains other men to enslave Honored Matres, until he and Sheeana escape in the untraceable ship.\nDuncan is portrayed by Richard Jordan in the 1984 film. James Watson plays the role in the 2000 miniseries, and is succeeded by Edward Atterton in its 2003 sequel. Jason Momoa portrays Duncan in the 2021 film.\nWellington Yueh.\nDr. Wellington Yueh is a Suk doctor and the trusted personal physician of Duke Leto Atreides. In \"Dune\", Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is intent on the destruction of House Atreides, who have been lured to Arrakis on the pretense of taking over the valuable spice mining operation there. Though Suk Imperial Conditioning supposedly makes the subject incapable of inflicting harm, the Baron has taken Yueh's Bene Gesserit wife Wanna prisoner, threatening her with interminable torture unless Yueh complies with his demands. Aware of Yueh's conditioning and believing Wanna was killed by the Harkonnens, Leto's Mentat Thufir Hawat and concubine Lady Jessica are assured that the doctor is not a Harkonnen spy.\nYueh disables the protective shields around the Atreides palace on Arrakis, and the Harkonnen forces (secretly supplemented by the seemingly unstoppable Imperial Sardaukar warriors) attack. Yueh takes Leto prisoner, but desiring to slay the Baron in defiance of his conditioning, Yueh provides the captive Leto with a fake tooth filled with poisonous gas as a means to kill the Baron, though Leto would die as well. Upon delivering Leto, Yueh confirms his belief that Wanna is already dead, moments before the Baron's twisted Mentat Piter De Vries kills him. The Baron escapes the poison, which only kills Leto and De Vries. Leto's son Paul flees into the desert with Jessica, aided by survival kits left for them by a compassionate Yueh.\nYueh is portrayed by Dean Stockwell in the 1984 film, and by Robert Russell in the 2000 miniseries. Chang Chen plays the character in the 2021 film.\nThe character also appears in the \"Prelude to Dune\" prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, and is resurrected as a ghola in \"Hunters of Dune\" and \"Sandworms of Dune\", the Brian Herbert/Anderson sequels which conclude the original series. In \"Prelude to Dune\", a younger Baron Harkonnen consults with Yueh seeking a cure for the debilitating disease which is slowly but surely rendering him obese. Yueh is aware of no cure, but correctly suggests that the disease's source may be the Bene Gesserit. The early years of Yueh as the physician to House Atreides are also explored in the novels. In \"Hunters of Dune\", set 5,000 years after \"Dune\", Yueh is resurrected as a ghola to aid in the coming final battle with mankind's \"great enemy.\" In \"Sandworms of Dune\", the finale of the original series, the young Yueh ghola is wracked by feelings of intense guilt over the actions of the \"original\" Yueh. Though he does not yet possess those memories, he fears that he will repeat those mistakes. A ghola's memories are restored by subjecting the ghola to an intense personal trauma, specific to each individual, so Yueh's great fear of having his memories restored becomes the trigger used by the Bene Gesserit to unlock them. Later, Yueh kills the gestating ghola of Leto, having been tricked into believing that it was De Vries, and ultimately also kills the ghola of the Baron Harkonnen. Eleven years later, Yueh lives on the original Atreides homeworld Caladan, helping the Jessica ghola restore it to its former glory.\nMohiam.\nBene Gesserit Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam is Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV's Truthsayer, and Lady Jessica's former teacher. In \"Dune\", Mohiam subjects 15-year-old Paul Atreides to a life or death test of his humanity: he is inflicted with excruciating pain, but must exert control over his survival instinct and withstand it, or be killed instantly with a poisoned needle. Paul passes the test, having sustained more pain than anyone before him. Mohiam, though still furious at Jessica for disobeying the Sisterhood's command that she bear a daughter for their breeding scheme, is intrigued by the potential she sees in Paul and his nascent prescient abilities. Years later on Arrakis, Mohiam is shaken by her encounter with Paul's four-year-old sister Alia, who by misadventure had been born a fully aware Reverend Mother. Mohiam is further alarmed by the ritual battle-to-the-death between Paul and the Harkonnen heir, Feyd-Rautha, which could prove catastrophic for the Bene Gesserit breeding program no matter the outcome. Paul is victorious in the duel, and in seizing control of Arrakis, the only source of the all-important spice melange, gains insurmountable power over all civilization. Seeing the inevitability of the situation Paul has orchestrated, Mohiam compels Shaddam to give in to Paul's demands and relinquish the Imperial throne to him.\nTwelve years later in \"Dune Messiah\", Mohiam joins a conspiracy to topple the rule of Paul Atreides that includes the Tleilaxu Face Dancer Scytale, the Spacing Guild Navigator Edric, and even Paul's embittered consort Princess Irulan, Shaddam's daughter. Paul has sworn that only his Fremen concubine, Chani, will bear his children. Knowing that the Bene Gesserit are desperate to regain control of his bloodline for their breeding program, and are fearful of the effect Chani's \"wild\" genes may have on their offspring, Paul makes Mohiam an offer. In exchange for Chani's guaranteed safety, and the Sisterhood's acceptance of his decision to father no heirs with Irulan, Paul offers something of the utmost value: his sperm. This is a complicated proposition for Mohiam, because artificial insemination is forbidden in the wake of the anti-technology Butlerian Jihad, and the idea of it is as horrific to the Sisterhood as the loss of the precious Atreides genes. The conspiracy ultimately fails, and Paul kills Scytale. Edric and Mohiam are executed on orders from Paul's sister Alia, despite Paul's previous instructions to spare Mohiam's life.\nMohiam is portrayed by Si\u00e2n Phillips in the 1984 film, and by Zuzana Geislerov\u00e1 in the 2000 miniseries and its 2003 sequel. The character is played by Charlotte Rampling in the 2021 film and its 2024 sequel.\nRabban.\nGlossu \"Beast\" Rabban Harkonnen is the violent and brutish older nephew of Baron Harkonnen. He is as cruel and sadistic as his uncle, but lacks the Baron's intelligence. The Baron tasks Rabban to rule the planet Arrakis for a time in the most brutal way possible, so that when his favored nephew Feyd-Rautha takes over, Feyd will be welcomed as a hero by the populace.\nAfter the Baron seizes the planet back from Atreides control, Rabban tells his uncle that the Harkonnens have woefully underestimated both the numbers and threat of the Fremen population there. Known as \"the Beast Rabban\" on Arrakis for his aggression and cruelty, his Fremen nickname is \"Mudir Nahya\", which translates as \"Demon Ruler\" or \"King Cobra\". Rabban is killed by the Fremen and the people of Arrakeen when Paul \"Muad'Dib\" Atreides retakes Arrakis using Fremen forces.\nTravis Johnson of Flicks.com.au describes Rabban as \"the Baron's murderous and notably less Machiavellian nephew\". Noting that the characters in \"Dune\" fit mythological archetypes, novelist Brian Herbert, Frank Herbert's son and biographer, writes that \"Beast Rabban Harkonnen, though evil and aggressive, is essentially a fool.\"\nRabban is portrayed by Paul L. Smith in the 1984 film, and by in the 2000 \"Dune\" miniseries. The character is played by Dave Bautista in the 2021 film and its 2024 sequel.\nRabban also appears in the \"Prelude to Dune\" prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. In the series, he kills Duncan Idaho's parents and Gurney Halleck's sister, and earns his nickname \"Beast\" when he strangles his own father.\nFeyd-Rautha.\nFeyd-Rautha Harkonnen is the charismatic yet deadly younger nephew and heir of Baron Harkonnen. In \"Dune\", the Baron favors Feyd over his older brother Glossu Rabban because of Feyd's intelligence and his dedication to the Harkonnen culture of carefully planned and subtly executed sadism and cruelty, as opposed to Rabban's outright brutality. The Baron's succession plan is to install Feyd as ruler of Arrakis after a period of tyrannical misrule by Rabban, making Feyd appear to be the savior of the people. Like Paul Atreides, Feyd is also the product of a centuries-long breeding program organized by the Bene Gesserit, who planned to breed a Harkonnen son with an Atreides daughter with the expectation that their offspring would have a high probability of being their hoped-for super-being, the Kwisatz Haderach. For this reason, Lady Jessica's decision to defy the Sisterhood and to produce an Atreides son, Paul, threw the Bene Gesserit's plans into turmoil and established an irreconcilable tension between Feyd and Paul as the scions of their bitterly opposed noble houses. The risk of one or both of these young men being killed, destroying thousands of years of genetic engineering, is so great that the Bene Gesserit send an envoy, Margot Fenring, to seduce Feyd and conceive a child, salvaging his genetic material. Margot also uses an imprinting technique to condition Feyd to be vulnerable to Bene Gesserit control in the future. It is also later noted that Feyd's encounter with Lady Fenring produced a daughter. Feyd's ambition and impatience to inherit the Baron's title and power spur him to attempt his uncle's assassination. The attempt fails, prompting the Baron to reveal to his nephew the lofty plans he has for him, possibly to even have him ascend the throne as Emperor. The Baron explains that the elevation of House Harkonnen means more to him than power in his own lifetime, so if Feyd promises to forego any further assassination attempts, he will voluntarily step down and let his nephew succeed him\u2014after his plot against the Emperor has succeeded. Feyd agrees, but as punishment for the failed assassination attempt, the Baron forces Feyd to single-handedly slaughter all the female slaves who serve as his lovers so that Feyd will learn the price of failure. As Paul seizes control of the all-important planet Arrakis and makes his final bid to usurp the Padishah Emperor's power, he is challenged by Feyd, the current Harkonnen leader after the deaths of the Baron and Rabban. Though famed for his prowess in single combat, Feyd intends to guarantee victory by breaking the formal rules of kanly (which govern this type of challenge) and using a hidden poison spur in his fighting outfit. He nearly succeeds in killing Paul in the ritualized fight, as Paul struggles with whether to try the paralysis word-sound given to him by his mother, and owe the Bene Gesserit his victory, or to risk his life against Feyd in a \"fair\" fight. Paul manages to defeat Feyd without the command, killing him, and goes on to accede to the Imperial throne.\nFeyd is portrayed by Sting in the 1984 film, and by Matt Keeslar in the 2000 miniseries. The character does not appear in the 2021 film, but is played by Austin Butler in its 2024 sequel.\nPrincess Irulan.\nPrincess Irulan is the eldest daughter of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV and the Bene Gesserit Anirul. The character serves as a \"de facto\" narrator in \"Dune\", with excerpts of Irulan's later writings used as epigraphs before each chapter of the novel. In forms such as diary entries, historical commentary, biography, quotations and philosophy, these writings set tone and provide exposition, context and other details intended to enhance understanding of Herbert's complex fictional universe and themes. In \"Dune\", a widespread rebellion of the native Fremen on Arrakis creates a disruption in the production of the all-important spice melange, bringing Shaddam and his court, including Irulan, to the planet to impose order. Paul Atreides leads the Fremen in an overwhelming victory over the combined Harkonnen and Imperial Sardaukar forces and seizes control of Arrakis, the only known source of the spice. Paul demands that Shaddam relinquish the Imperial throne to him or he will destroy all spice production and plunge the universe into chaos. Shaddam bristles at Paul's suggestion that he marry Irulan, but she immediately recognizes the inevitability of the situation Paul has orchestrated, and tells Shaddam, \"Here's a man fit to be your son.\" Once Paul defeats the treacherous Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen in single combat, and Count Fenring refuses the Emperor's order to kill Paul, Shaddam capitulates.\nTwelve years later in \"Dune Messiah\", Irulan is Paul's consort and trusted advisor, but he has sworn that only his beloved concubine Chani will bear his children. Paul and Chani remain childless, however, because a resentful Irulan, Bene Gesserit-trained and doing their bidding, has been secretly feeding Chani contraceptives to prevent her from conceiving an Imperial heir. The Sisterhood are desperate to regain control of Paul's bloodline for their breeding program, and are fearful of the effect Chani's \"wild\" genes may have on their offspring. But when Chani begins an ancient Fremen fertility diet high in melange, Irulan loses her ability to interfere, and Chani becomes pregnant. Chani ultimately discovers not only Irulan's role in her infertility but the fact that the contraceptives have caused permanent damage and will jeopardize her pregnancy. Chani seeks to kill Irulan, but Paul forbids it. He is secretly somewhat grateful to Irulan, as he has seen through his prescience that childbirth will bring Chani's death, and so Irulan has unwittingly extended Chani's life. Chani dies giving birth to the twins Leto II and Ghanima, and a newly blinded Paul follows Fremen custom and wanders alone into the desert to die. Realizing her love for Paul, Irulan breaks ties with the Bene Gesserit and dedicates herself to his children.\nNine years later in \"Children of Dune\", Irulan's sister Wensicia plots to assassinate Leto and Ghanima to reclaim power for House Corrino through her son, Farad'n. Irulan also serves as chief advisor to Paul's sister Alia, who reigns as Holy Regent for the twins. Irulan attempts to serve as a guide and confidante to Ghanima, but is often flustered by the adult consciousness the twins possess as a result of being pre-born and having access to Other Memory. Ghanima cares for Irulan, but Alia never trusts the princess, due to Irulan's Corrino heritage and Alia's own increasing paranoia. Irulan flees into the desert with Ghanima and Stilgar during the Fremen rebellion against Alia's tyranny. Though the other rebels are massacred, Irulan and Stilgar are imprisoned upon their capture, and presumably freed when Leto deposes Alia.\nIrulan is portrayed by Virginia Madsen in the 1984 film, and by Julie Cox in the 2000 miniseries and its 2003 sequel. The character does not appear in the 2021 film, but is played by Florence Pugh in its 2024 sequel.\nShaddam IV.\nShaddam IV of House Corrino is the Padishah Emperor of the Known Universe, whose power is secured by his armies of fierce Sardaukar warriors and control of the desert planet Arrakis, the only source of the all-important spice melange. In \"Dune\", Shaddam has granted Duke Leto Atreides control of the lucrative spice mining operations on Arrakis, previously managed by House Harkonnen, longtime enemies of the Atreides. Leto is aware that this assignment is some kind of trap, but is unable to refuse. Shaddam is threatened by Leto's growing influence among the Landsraad assembly of noble families, and uses the centuries-old feud between the Atreides and Harkonnens to disguise his moves against Leto. The forces of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, secretly bolstered by Shaddam's Sardaukar and aided by a traitor in Leto's household, launch an attack that devastates the Atreides forces. Leto is killed, and his Bene Gesserit concubine Lady Jessica, and heir Paul, flee into the desert and are presumed dead in a sandstorm.\nYears later, a rebellion of the native Fremen on Arrakis creates a disruption in the production of the all-important spice melange, bringing Shaddam and his court to the planet to impose order. Paul Atreides is alive, and has risen as a military and religious leader among the Fremen. He leads them in an overwhelming victory over the combined Harkonnen and Imperial forces and seizes control of Arrakis. Paul demands that Shaddam relinquish the Imperial throne to him or he will destroy all spice production and plunge the universe into chaos. Shaddam resists, but is forced to capitulate after Paul defeats Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen in single combat, and Count Fenring refuses Shaddam's order to kill Paul. Paul intends to take Shaddam's daughter, Princess Irulan, as his consort, and exile Shaddam.\nShaddam is described as \"red-haired\" by Irulan via epigraph in \"Dune\", and noted to be 72 years old yet looking no older than 35. He is the son of Elrood IX and the 81st member of House Corrino to occupy the Golden Lion Throne. Shaddam has five daughters\u2014the Princesses Irulan, Chalice, Wensicia, Josifa, and Rugi\u2014and no legal sons by his wife Anirul, a Bene Gesserit of Hidden Rank. His closest friend is the assassin Count Fenring, a cousin and childhood companion.\nShaddam is portrayed by Jos\u00e9 Ferrer in the 1984 film, and by Giancarlo Giannini in the 2000 miniseries. Giannini also dubbed himself in the Italian version of the miniseries. The character does not appear in the 2021 film, but is played by Christopher Walken in its 2024 sequel.\nShaddam also appears in multiple prequel series by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson: \"Prelude to Dune\", \"Heroes of Dune\" and \"The Caladan Trilogy\". In the \"Prelude to Dune\" trilogy, Shaddam is eager to succeed his father Elrood IX as Padishah Emperor, but despite his advanced age Elrood shows no signs of ill health. Shaddam finally tasks his longtime friend and minion Fenring to administer Elrood with an undetectable, slow-acting poison. Shaddam had previously been complicit in the murder of his elder brother, the Crown Prince Fafnir, and had secretly administered contraceptives to his own mother, Habla, so she could not conceive another son to rival him. Elrood finally dies, and Shaddam secures his throne by paying the Spacing Guild with a supply of the spice and by arranging his own marriage to a Bene Gesserit. This union with the Lady Anirul Sadow-Tonkin results in five daughters, but no sons.\nGurney Halleck.\nGurney Halleck is the Warmaster of Duke Leto Atreides, trained by \"the best fighters in the universe\", who has in turn trained Leto's son and heir Paul in hand-to-hand combat. Gurney, Duncan Idaho and the Mentat Thufir Hawat serve Leto as a war council unparalleled in the Imperium. Gurney is also a talented troubadour. In \"Dune\", Gurney and 73 of his men survive the Harkonnen attack that devastates the Atreides forces, and they fall in with local spice smugglers to survive. Gurney and his team fall for a Fremen trap\u2014a fake hoard of spice\u2014and are almost killed before Paul, now the Fremen leader \"Muad'Dib\", recognizes him. Gurney nearly kills Jessica, mistakenly believing she betrayed Leto, but later becomes her loyal chief officer. In \"Children of Dune\", Gurney returns to Arrakis with Jessica and coordinates a purging of dissidents with Fremen leader Stilgar. Gurney follows what he believes are Jessica's orders to test Paul's son Leto II to be sure he has not been overcome by his ancestral memories. Learning that the testing was actually ordered by Paul's sister Alia, Gurney escapes, sending a message to Duncan to initiate their plan to force Stilgar to join the rebellion against Alia. Gurney flees to a rebel sietch and joins Leto II and the mysterious Preacher, who is actually a blinded Paul. After Leto II returns to Arrakeen and reclaims the throne from Alia, Gurney is assigned to Sietch Tabr as part of Stilgar's council.\nGurney is portrayed by Patrick Stewart in the 1984 film, and by P. H. Moriarty in the 2000 miniseries and its 2003 sequel. The character is played by Josh Brolin in the 2021 film and its 2024 sequel.\nCount Fenring.\nCount Hasimir Fenring is Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV's closest friend and advisor, and husband to the Bene Gesserit Lady Margot. Prior to the events of \"Dune\", Fenring serves as the Imperial Spice Minister on Arrakis during the Harkonnen regime, and then as Governor of Arrakis during the handover period between House Harkonnen and House Atreides. In \"Dune\", the Harkonnens, secretly aided by the Shaddam's fierce Sardaukar warriors, destroy the Atreides forces and reclaim control of Arrakis. Fenring and Margot visit the Harkonnen homeworld of Giedi Prime, where the Count informs Baron Harkonnen that Shaddam is displeased with the way the invasion of Arrakis was handled, and is frustrated by The Baron's failure to suppress the disruptive native Fremen population. Fenring is also there on the Emperor's behalf to assess the Harkonnen heir, Feyd, which irks the Baron. Margot is also observing Feyd for the Bene Gesserit, who count him as an important part of their breeding program. Fenring is impressed with Feyd, but laments his upbringing among the brutal Harkonnens. Later, Paul Atreides leads the Fremen in an overwhelming victory over the combined Harkonnen and Imperial forces and seizes control of Arrakis. Paul demands that Shaddam relinquish the Imperial throne to him or he will destroy all spice production and plunge the universe into chaos. Shaddam resists, and Fenring, a deadly fighter and rumored assassin, is summoned and ordered to kill Paul. He refuses, aware that Paul represents the success of the Bene Gesserit breeding program of which Fenring himself is a failure. Paul deposes Shaddam, and the Fenrings join the former emperor in exile.\nFenring does not appear in the 1984 film, but is portrayed by Miroslav T\u00e1borsk\u00fd in the 2000 miniseries.\nMargot Fenring.\nMargot, Lady Fenring, is the Bene Gesserit wife of Count Hasimir Fenring. Though the Count is the close friend and advisor of the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, Margot's primary loyalty is to the Sisterhood. In \"Dune\", Duke Leto Atreides is lured to the desert planet Arrakis on the pretense of taking over the lucrative spice mining operation there, but the assignment is part of a plot by Shaddam and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen to destroy the Atreides. Margot leaves a coded message for Leto's Bene Gesserit concubine, Lady Jessica, warning her that the Atreides, especially Leto and Jessica's son Paul, are in imminent danger from the Harkonnens, and alerts her to the existence of a traitor in the Atreides household. Paul evades a trap set for him, but a devastating attack by the Harkonnens leaves Leto dead, and forces Paul and Jessica to flee into the desert. Due to the harsh conditions and an oncoming sandstorm, they are soon presumed dead. Margot is sent by the Bene Gesserit to seduce Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen and to \"preserve the bloodline\" by retrieving his genetic material, through conception, for their breeding program. She later bears Feyd's daughter. Margot also uses an imprinting technique to condition Feyd to be vulnerable to Bene Gesserit control in the future. Paul and Feyd later duel to the death, and Paul is victorious without using Margot's implanted command. Having seized control of the all-important Arrakis, Paul deposes Shaddam, and the Fenrings join the former emperor in exile.\nMargot does not appear in the 1984 film, 2000 miniseries or 2021 film, but is portrayed by L\u00e9a Seydoux in the 2024 sequel film.\nThufir Hawat.\nThufir Hawat is a Mentat, an individual conditioned to mimic the cognitive and analytical ability of computers, who serves as Master of Assassins and primary military strategist for Duke Leto Atreides. In \"Dune\", the Atreides are lured to Arrakis on the pretense of taking over the lucrative spice mining operation there, but soon fall prey to a catastrophic attack by their longtime enemies the Harkonnens, whose forces are secretly bolstered by the fierce Sardaukar warriors of the emperor, Shaddam IV. Thufir is captured, and the calculating Baron Vladimir Harkonnen takes him as a replacement for his own twisted Mentat Piter De Vries, who was killed in the aftermath of the attack. The Baron hopes to channel Thufir's desire for revenge away from House Harkonnen, and keeps his abilities in check by feeding him false data, specifically, permitting him to believe that Leto's concubine Lady Jessica had been the traitor responsible for the Atreides' destruction. Thufir is also secretly administered a residual poison which requires regular doses of an antidote to prevent death.\nIn spite of these obstacles, Thufir attempts to bring down the Harkonnens from within. He gains the trust of the Baron's nephew and heir Feyd-Rautha by assisting him with a plot to discredit the Harkonnen slavemaster and replace him with someone loyal to Feyd. Thufir encourages the ambitions of Feyd against the Baron, which leads him to attempt to assassinate his uncle. The Baron, warned by Thufir, eludes the attempt and punishes Feyd for his failure. Later, Thufir is coerced to assassinate Leto's son, Paul Atreides. Paul suspects this, but out of gratitude for Thufir's exceptional loyalty, Paul gives him the opportunity to take anything Thufir wishes of him, even his life. Hawat chooses death from the poison rather than to betray Paul.\nThufir is portrayed by Freddie Jones in the 1984 film, and by in the 2000 miniseries. The character is played by Stephen McKinley Henderson in the 2021 film and he filmed scenes for its 2024 sequel. However, his scenes were not included in the final cut.\nThe character also appears in the \"Prelude to Dune\" prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, and is resurrected as a ghola in \"Hunters of Dune\" and \"Sandworms of Dune\", the Brian Herbert/Anderson sequels which conclude the original series.\nAlia Atreides.\nAlia is the daughter of Duke Leto and Jessica, and Paul's younger sister. Subjected to the Fremen spice agony in the womb, she is born a fully aware Reverend Mother. Among the Bene Gesserit, a child born in this manner, called an Abomination, is immediately killed because they are susceptible to being overtaken by their ancestral personas. Alia pretends to be a child as she grows up among the Fremen. At four years old, she kills her grandfather, the Baron Harkonnen, as Paul seizes control of Arrakis. As Paul's sister, Alia is worshipped in her own right in \"Dune Messiah\". She and Hayt, who is the swordmaster Duncan Idaho brought back from the dead as a ghola by Tleilaxu means, work together to unravel the conspiracy against the Atreides. Alia is named regent for Paul and Chani's children, Leto II and Ghanima, and Duncan's memories are restored. In \"Children of Dune\", Alia has married Duncan but the danger of Abomination has come to fruition, and Alia is possessed by the persona of the Baron. Her increasing depravity and lust for power under his control drive her to plot Jessica's assassination. Confronted by Leto and overcome by the Baron, Alia has a fleeting moment of self-control and leaps to her death.\nAlia is portrayed by Alicia Witt in the 1984 film, and by Laura Burton in the 2000 miniseries. Daniela Amavia portrays an adult Alia in the 2003 sequel miniseries. The character does not appear in the 2021 film, which covers the first part of \"Dune\", but is portrayed by Anya Taylor-Joy in a cameo appearance in the 2024 sequel film.\nShadout Mapes.\nThe Shadout Mapes is the mysterious Fremen housekeeper at the palace of Arakeen on Arrakis. In \"Dune\", Duke Leto Atreides, his Bene Gesserit concubine Lady Jessica, and their son Paul arrive as Leto takes over management of the planet's lucrative spice mining operations. The Fremen begin to believe that Paul is their prophesied messiah, who is foretold to be accompanied by his Bene Gesserit mother, and when talking to Mapes, Jessica uses phrases that are part of the legend. Mapes gives Jessica a crysknife, a weapon made from the tooth of a giant sandworm that is considered holy by the Fremen and rarely seen by outsiders. Paul later saves Mapes from a deadly hunter-seeker intended to kill him, and she warns of a traitor in the Atreides household. Mapes is killed by that same traitor, Suk doctor Wellington Yueh, as the Harkonnens attack.\nMapes is portrayed by Linda Hunt in the 1984 film, and by Jaroslava \u0160iktancov\u00e1 in the 2000 miniseries. Golda Rosheuvel plays the character in the 2021 film.\nMapes is the main character of the 2022 short story \"\" by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, which takes place before the events of the \"Prelude to Dune\" trilogy.\nLiet-Kynes.\nLiet-Kynes is the Imperial Planetologist of the desert planet Arrakis, and the father of Chani by his Fremen wife, Faroula. In \"Dune\", Duke Leto Atreides meets with Kynes soon after arriving on Arrakis to take over the melange harvesting operations there. Escorted by the planet's native Fremen, Kynes is the liaison between them and the Imperials. Kynes takes personal note of Leto's son Paul, who seems to know Fremen ways intuitively, and shows signs of being a prophesied Fremen messiah. The Atreides later hear of a person or deity named \"Liet\" to whom all the Fremen communities give allegiance.\nIt is only after Leto is killed, and Paul and his mother, Lady Jessica, take refuge among the Fremen that Liet and Kynes are revealed to be the same person. He is the son of Pardot Kynes, the first Imperial Planetologist of Arrakis, and a Fremen woman, and is Chani's father. Captured by the Harkonnens and left to die in the desert without a stillsuit or water, Kynes is killed by a spice blow, an explosive eruption that is part of the melange cycle. In \"God Emperor of Dune\", Liet-Kynes's wife and Chani's mother is identified as Faroula, \"a noted herbalist among the Fremen\".\nLiet-Kynes is portrayed by Max von Sydow in the 1984 film, and by Karel Dobr\u00fd in the 2000 miniseries. Sharon Duncan-Brewster plays a gender-swapped version of the character in the 2021 film.\nLiet-Kynes also appears in the \"Prelude to Dune\" prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. That series establishes that his mother is Frieth, the sister of Stilgar. Growing up under Fremen tradition, Liet inherits his father's position as planetologist as well as his secret goal of terraforming Arrakis into a temperate planet.\nRamallo.\nReverend Mother Ramallo is a spiritual leader, or Sayyadina, among the Fremen of Sietch Tabr on Arrakis, a \"wild\" version of a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother. In \"Dune\", Paul Atreides and his Bene Gesserit mother, Lady Jessica, flee a Harkonnen attack and find refuge among the Fremen. When Ramallo knows she is nearing the end of her life, Jessica undergoes the ritual spice agony to make her Ramallo's replacement. The Fremen ordeal to become a Reverend Mother involves ingesting the poisonous Water of Life, the exhalation of a dying sandworm. Jessica survives and shares minds with Ramallo, acquiring the older woman's life experiences and collective ancestral Other Memory, and then Ramallo dies.\nRamallo is portrayed by Italian actress Silvana Mangano in the 1984 film. Drahom\u00edra Fialkov\u00e1 plays the character in the 2000 miniseries, with Petra Kul\u00edkov\u00e1 as a younger version of Ramallo. Giusi Merli portrays the dying Fremen Reverend mother in the 2024 film \"Dune: Part Two\".\nRamallo also appears in the \"Prelude to Dune\" prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.\nJamis.\nJamis is a formidable Fremen warrior from Sietch Tabr. In \"Dune\", Paul Atriedes and his Bene Gesserit mother, Lady Jessica, flee a Harkonnen attack and find refuge with the Fremen of Sietch Tabr. Newcomer Paul is immediately challenged by the distrustful Fremen warrior Jamis, and per Fremen custom they engage in a ritual fight to the death. Paul kills Jamis, and is subsequently obliged to take responsibility for his wife Harah and children.\nJamis is portrayed by Judd Omen in the 1984 film, Christopher Lee Brown in the 2000 miniseries, and by Babs Olusanmokun in the 2021 film.\nHarah.\nHarah is the Fremen wife of Jamis. Her first husband was Geoff, by whom she had a son, Kaleff. Jamis defeated Geoff in a ritual duel and took Harah as his own wife, and fathered her son Orlop. After Paul kills Jamis in a ritual fight to the death in \"Dune\", Fremen custom demands that Paul inherit his possessions, including Harah and her children. Paul must take her into his household as his wife or his servant, and after a year if he has not married her, she may choose as she wishes. Paul accepts Harah as a servant. She is at first insulted by his reluctance to marry her, but dedicates herself to his service. Harah becomes very close to, and protective of, Paul's young sister Alia, who is born a fully aware Reverend Mother and pretends to be a child as she grows up among the Fremen. In \"Children of Dune\", Harah is married to Stilgar, and is Chani's closest friend. She is witness to the birth of Paul and Chani's twins, Leto II and Ghanima, and to Chani's subsequent death. Harah dedicates herself to the care of the twins. When an adult Alia's tyranny becomes too great and endangers Leto and Ghanima, Harah goes into hiding with Stilgar, Princess Irulan and the children.\nHarah is portrayed by Molly Wrynn in the 1984 film.\nPiter De Vries.\nPiter De Vries is a Mentat, an individual conditioned to mimic the cognitive and analytical ability of computers, who serves the ruthless Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. Piter has the added distinction of having been \"twisted\" into an amoral sadist by the Tleilaxu.\nIn \"Dune\", Piter is the architect of the plan to destroy House Atreides, longtime enemy of the Harkonnens, while restoring the Baron's stewardship over the planet Arrakis. Though the personal physician of Duke Leto Atreides, Wellington Yueh, has undergone Suk conditioning which renders him incapable of inflicting harm on his patients, Piter subverts it by kidnapping and torturing Yueh's wife. Hoping to free her, Yueh betrays the Atreides, enabling a catastrophic attack by the Harkonnens and delivering Leto to the Baron. Yueh learns that his wife is already dead and is killed by Piter. Yueh, however, has given the captive Leto a false tooth filled with poison gas with which to assassinate the Baron. The Baron evades the assassination but Leto and Piter die. Piter is the creator of residual poison, a toxin which requires regular doses of an antidote to prevent death. The Baron secretly administers it to the captured Atreides Mentat Thufir Hawat as coercion to make him the replacement for Piter.\nIn the novel, Piter is described as \"tall, though slender, and something about him suggested effeminacy\". He is addicted to the drug melange, and also has the ruby red lips characteristic of those who consume sapho juice, an addictive drug which enhances Mentat capabilities.\nPiter is portrayed by Brad Dourif in the 1984 film, and by Jan Unger in the 2000 miniseries. David Dastmalchian plays the character in the 2021 film.\nPiter also appears in the \"Prelude to Dune\" prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. In the series, Piter discovers the Harkonnen heritage of Lady Jessica and her newborn son Paul, and attempts to kidnap and ransom the infant. The plot is thwarted and the secret preserved when Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Mohiam kills the Mentat and arranges for his corpse to be shipped home to the Harkonnen homeworld, Giedi Prime. An enraged Baron Harkonnen is left with no choice but to order a duplicate from the Bene Tleilax: the Mentat Piter featured in Herbert's original novel \"Dune\".\nIntroduced in \"Dune Messiah\" (1969).\nScytale.\nScytale is a Tleilaxu Face Dancer who executes a plot to dethrone Paul Atriedes in \"Dune Messiah\". Scytale's conspiracy includes Spacing Guild Navigator Edric, the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Mohiam, and the Princess Irulan, Paul's consort. Unlike Face Dancers depicted later in the series, Scytale appears autonomous, and his high-level dealings with the other conspirators suggest a certain rank and level of trust among the Tleilaxu. Scytale notes of Face Dancers, \"We are Jadacha hermaphrodites ... either sex at will.\" He subsequently kills and assumes the appearance of Lichna, the daughter of the trusted Fremen commando Otheym, in order to lure Paul from the Atreides Keep to Otheym's house, where Scytale has planted an atomic weapon. The attack fails to kill Paul, but the atomic blast blinds him. Scytale soon makes an attempt to force Paul's allegiance. With the Tleilaxu ghola of Duncan Idaho having regained the memories of the deceased original, Scytale has proven that the Tleilaxu can resurrect a human being. He offers Paul a ghola of his concubine Chani, who has just died giving birth to their twin children, in exchange for Paul surrendering his empire to Tleilaxu control. Though tempted, Paul refuses. Scytale holds a knife over the newborn twins, threatening to kill them instantly unless Paul accepts. Paul instead kills Scytale with a thrown crysknife, guided by a vision sent by his infant son.\nIn \"Heretics of Dune\", 5000 years after the events of \"Dune Messiah\", a ghola of Scytale is a Tleilaxu Master and one of Tleilaxu leader Tylwyth Waff's nine councillors. The novel establishes that after learning how to restore a ghola's memories in \"Dune Messiah\", the Masters use this knowledge as a form of immortality, creating clones from their living cells which can be reawakened upon their deaths. Face Dancers are still Tleilaxu servants rather than emissaries, and Herbert does not explain how the Scytale of \"Dune Messiah\"\u2014a Face Dancer, though autonomous\u2014could ascend to become a Master, or how the Master/Face Dancer relationship may have evolved over the millennia.\nIn \"Chapterhouse Dune\" (1985), the fearsome Honored Matres have destroyed all of the Tleilaxu worlds in retaliation for the Tleilaxu role in programming the latest Duncan Idaho ghola with knowledge of how to sexually enslave Honored Matres. Scytale, likely the last surviving Tleilaxu Master, barely escapes the attack while leaving his homeworld and is given sanctuary by the Bene Gesserit. Essentially a prisoner, he is kept in a no-ship grounded on the secret Bene Gesserit planet Chapterhouse. In exchange for their protection, Scytale has given the Bene Gesserit the knowledge to create axlotl tanks to grow their own gholas. Desiring his own Face Dancer servants, axlotl tanks, and access to the ship's systems, Scytale has held back the secret to creating artificial melange for future negotiations. His secret bargaining chip is a nullentropy capsule containing cells carefully and covertly collected by the Tleilaxu for millennia, including those of Tleilaxu Masters and Face Dancers, Paul, Chani, the original Duncan Idaho, Thufir Hawat, Gurney Halleck and Stilgar.\nThe character \"The Baron's Doctor\" in the 1984 film \"Dune\", portrayed by Leonardo Cimino, was intended to be revealed as Scytale in \"Dune II\", a planned sequel film adapting \"Dune Messiah\" which was never made. Posing as Baron Harkonnen's physician, Scytale would have absconded with Duncan Idaho's corpse and spent years reviving it. Scytale is portrayed by Martin McDougall in the 2003 miniseries \"Frank Herbert's Children of Dune\", which is an adaptation of both \"Dune Messiah\" and its sequel \"Children of Dune\".\nScytale also appears in the sequel novels \"Hunters of Dune\" and \"Sandworms of Dune\" by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. In \"Hunters of Dune\", Scytale is desperate, as his current body is slowly dying, and he does not have another to replace it. Needing to grow a new ghola clone of himself, his only bargaining tool is the secret nullentropy capsule. Other cells in Scytale's possession include those of Leto I, Lady Jessica, Leto II and other legendary figures dating back to Serena Butler and Xavier Harkonnen from the Butlerian Jihad. The Bene Gesserit debate whether to create gholas of any of these historical figures, and despite the controversy, gholas are created a few at a time. Scytale is allowed to have his own once the first few have been born. In \"Sandworms of Dune\", Scytale finally reawakens his own ghola's memories using the trauma of watching the elder Scytale die in front of his younger self. Along with gholas of the Tleilaxu Masters, Scytale grows Tleilaxu females from newly discovered cells, vowing to never again allow the Masters to corrupt the recovering Tleilaxu people.\nEdric.\nEdric is a Spacing Guild Navigator and the Guild's ambassador on Arrakis. In \"Dune Messiah\", Edric engages in a conspiracy to dethrone Emperor Paul Atreides, joined by the Tleilaxu Face Dancer Scytale, the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Mohiam, and Paul's embittered consort, Princess Irulan. As its Navigators require immense quantities of melange to navigate foldspace, the Spacing Guild has a vested interest in breaking Paul's stranglehold over the spice supply. Edric's involvement also protects the conspirators from discovery, as his prescience hides the activities of himself and those around him from other prescients, like Paul. The plot ultimately fails, and Edric and Mohiam are executed by Fremen naib Stilgar on orders from Paul's sister, Alia Atreides.\nIn \"Chapterhouse Dune\", a \"very powerful\" Navigator is described as \"one of the Edrics\", suggesting a possible breeding plan or use of gholas.\nBijaz.\nBijaz is a Tleilaxu dwarf in the employ of Otheym, one of the former Fedaykin death commandos of Paul Atreides. In \"Dune Messiah\", Otheym reveals to Paul evidence of a Fremen conspiracy against him. Otheym gives Paul his dwarf Tleilaxu servant Bijaz, who has the ability to remember faces, names and details like a recording machine. Paul accepts reluctantly, seeing the strands of a Tleilaxu plot. Bijaz, actually an agent of the Tleilaxu Face Dancer Scytale, uses a specific humming intonation to implant a command that will compel the Duncan Idaho ghola, Hayt, to kill Paul under certain circumstances. Paul's concubine Chani dies in childbirth, and Paul's reaction to her death triggers Hayt's assassination attempt. Hayt's ghola body reacts against its own programming and Duncan's full consciousness is recovered, simultaneously making him independent of Tleilaxu control. Having proven that a ghola's memories of its originator can be restored, Scytale offers Paul a ghola of Chani in exchange for Paul surrendering his empire to Tleilaxu control. Paul refuses, and Scytale is killed. Later, Bijaz approaches Paul and repeats Scytale's offer, but is killed by Duncan on Paul's order.\nBijaz is portrayed by Gee Williams in the 2003 miniseries.\nLichna.\nLichna is the daughter of Otheym, one of Paul's former Fedaykin death commandos. In \"Dune Messiah\", she is killed and impersonated by the shapeshifting Tleilaxu Face Dancer Scytale as a means to infiltrate Paul's household. Paul can see through the deception, but wants to see where the plot leads. Aware it is part of the conspiracy against him, Paul allows himself to be lured to Otheym's home in the city.\nLichna is portrayed by Kl\u00e1ra Issov\u00e1 in the 2003 miniseries.\nFarok.\nFarok is another of Paul's former Fedaykin. In \"Dune Messiah\", he is one of many Fremen disillusioned by the changes Paul's regime brings to their culture, and joins the conspiracy to unseat Paul.\nFarok is portrayed by Ivo Nov\u00e1k in the 2003 miniseries.\nIntroduced in \"Children of Dune\" (1976).\nPrincess Wensicia.\nPrincess Wensicia is the third daughter of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV and the Bene Gesserit Anirul, and the younger sister of Princess Irulan. In \"Children of Dune\", Shaddam is dead and Wensicia plots from exile to restore House Corrino to its former glory by wresting control of the Imperial throne from the usurper, Paul Atreides, for her son, Farad'n. She attempts to assassinate Leto II and Ghanima Atreides, Paul's twin heirs, by sending mechanically controlled Laza tigers to hunt them in the desert. Leto's growing prescience allows him to thwart the attack on himself and his sister, and he pretends to be dead to escape the increasingly murderous ambitions of his father's sister Alia. Later, Farad'n, newly trained in the Bene Gesserit ways by Paul and Alia's mother Lady Jessica, accepts an arrangement brokered by Jessica for him to marry Ghanima and share the throne. His part of the deal is to \"denounce and banish\" Wensicia for Leto's murder, which he does. Leto later returns and ascends the throne himself.\nWensicia is described as \"fair-haired\" with a \"heart-shaped face,\" and is said to have learned \"shifty trickiness\" from her sister Irulan but not herself been trained by the Bene Gesserit. Shaddam IV's heir is Wensicia's son Farad'n, whose deceased father, Dalak, is related to Count Fenring.\nWensicia is portrayed by Susan Sarandon in the 2003 miniseries. Sarandon told \"The New York Times\", \"One of the reasons I always loved the books was because they were driven by strong women, living outside the rules.\" She added that the \"Dune\" series \"is very apropos to some of what's going on in the world today. It's about the dangers of fundamentalism and the idea that absolute power corrupts.\" The actress said of Wensicia, \"She's just evil, evil, evil. I'm practically unrecognizable. It was a blast.\" Laura Fries of \"Variety\" wrote, \"it\u2019s Susan Sarandon and Alice Krige [as Lady Jessica] who steal the thunder as opposing matriarchs of the great royal houses. Although the two never catfight, their ongoing struggle to rule the \"Dune\" dynasty gives this mini a real kick.\" Observing that Sarandon and Krige were \"clearly relishing their roles\", Fries added that \"Sarandon makes a formidable enemy\". Melanie McFarland of the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" noted, \"[Sarandon's] exiled princess may be the villain, cooking up deadly schemes, but we're right along with her in having a good time.\" Sarandon herself said, \"it's always fun to play a smart villain.\" Not impressed overall with the acting in the miniseries, Ron Wertheimer of \"The New York Times\" wrote:\nIn the miniseries, Wensicia orchestrates the \"Dune Messiah\" conspiracy to assassinate Paul using a pre-programmed Tleilaxu ghola of his deceased friend Duncan Idaho, a plotline in which she is not involved in the novel. Emmet Asher-Perrin of \"Tor.com\" wrote:\nWensicia also appears in the novel \"Paul of Dune\" by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.\nLeto II Atreides.\nLeto II Atreides is the son of Paul Atreides and his Fremen concubine Chani, and the twin brother of Ghanima. Born at the end of \"Dune Messiah\", Leto is orphaned soon after, as his mother dies in childbirth and his blinded father, following Fremen custom, walks out into the open desert to die. Paul's sister Alia subsequently serves as regent for the twins in \"Children of Dune\", and Princess Irulan steps into the role of surrogate mother. Like Alia, Leto and Ghanima are \"pre-born\", having been awakened to adult consciousness and their genetic memories in the womb. The danger to individuals born this way, called Abomination by the Bene Gesserit, is that they are susceptible to being overtaken by their ancestral personas. Leto solves this problem by constructing his own personality out of an executive committee of his ancestors. Influenced by all the important ones, he cannot be possessed by an individual. Alia, however, is increasingly falling under the control of her late grandfather, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, whose hatred of the Atreides puts the twins in danger and threatens to topple Paul's empire. Deposed Emperor Shaddam IV's daughter Wensicia, Irulan's younger sister, plots from exile to place her son Farad'n on the throne and executes an assassination attempt on nine-year-old Leto and Ghanima. The twins anticipate and survive the plot. Leto leaves to seek out the mysterious Preacher, who some believe is Paul himself, and Ghanima hypnotizes herself to believe that Leto is dead. Like his father Paul before him, Leto enters a spice trance induced by an overdose of melange. His visions show him myriad possible futures where humanity becomes extinct, and only one where it survives. He names this future \"The Golden Path\" and resolves to bring it to fruition\u2014something that his father, who had already glimpsed this future, refused to do. Leto sacrifices his humanity to become a symbiont with the sandworm, beginning the transformation by allowing sandtrout, the larval stage of sandworms, to cover his body. The oversaturation of spice, and Leto's ability to adjust his body chemistry, fool the creatures into bonding with him, creating a membrane of \"new skin\" that bestows on him superhuman speed, strength and near-invulnerability. In addition, he will live for thousands of years, enough time to see his Golden Path to its completion. Leto returns to the capital where everyone has assembled for the wedding of Ghanima and Farad'n. Confronted by Leto and overcome by the Baron, Alia has a fleeting moment of self-control and leaps to her death. Leto declares himself Emperor, asserts control over the Fremen and restores Ghanima's genuine memories with a predetermined command. Farad'n pledges himself to Leto and delivers control of the remaining Sardaukar armies. Leto marries Ghanima to consolidate power, but Farad'n is her true consort so the Atreides line can continue.\nThirty-five hundred years later in \"God Emperor of Dune\", the God Emperor Leto II is now almost fully transformed into a sandworm, retaining only his human face and arms. He is seemingly immortal and invulnerable to harm, but also prone to instinct-driven bouts of violence when provoked to anger. As a result, Leto's oppressive rule is one of religious awe and despotic fear. Widely known as the Tyrant, he has killed all other sandworms by terraforming Arrakis into a verdant planet, and his control of the remaining supply of melange guarantees his stranglehold on civilization. All of the former major powers, like the Bene Gesserit and Spacing Guild, have capitulated. Following his Golden Path, Leto has forced the human population into a state of trans-galactic stagnation: space travel is non-existent to most people in his Empire, which he has deliberately kept to a near-medieval level of technological sophistication. A string of Duncan Idaho gholas have served Leto over the millennia, though they are prone to eventually rebel against him. Ghanima's descendant Moneo Atreides is Leto's majordomo and closest confidant, while Moneo's daughter Siona has become the leader of a local rebellion against Leto. The Ixians send a new ambassador named Hwi Noree, and though Leto realizes that she has been specifically designed and trained to ensnare him, he cannot resist falling in love with her. Exposure to concentrated spice essence awakens Siona to Leto's Golden Path, and though she sees its importance, she remains dedicated to his destruction. Siona and the current Duncan Idaho overcome a searing mutual hatred of each other to plan Leto's assassination, of which the God Emperor is aware and has made possible. As Leto's wedding procession moves across a high bridge, the conspirators destroy the support beams, and Leto's entourage, including Hwi, plunge to their deaths into the river below. Leto's body rends apart in the water, the outer layer of sandtrout encysting the water and scurrying off, while the rest burns and disintegrates on the shore. A dying Leto reveals to Siona a secret aspect of his Golden Path: she is the result of a breeding scheme to produce a human who is invisible to prescient vision. Siona and her descendants will possess this ability, and Leto explains that humanity is now free from the domination of oracles, free to scatter throughout the universe, never again to face complete domination or complete destruction. After revealing the location of his secret spice hoard, Leto dies, leaving Duncan and Siona to face the task of managing the empire.\nLeto is portrayed by James McAvoy in the 2003 miniseries.\nGhanima Atreides.\nGhanima Atreides is the daughter of Paul Atreides and his Fremen concubine Chani, and the twin sister of Leto II. Born at the end of \"Dune Messiah\", Ghanima is orphaned soon after, as her mother dies in childbirth and her blinded father, following Fremen custom, walks out into the open desert to die. Paul's sister Alia subsequently serves as regent for the twins in \"Children of Dune\", and Princess Irulan steps into the role of surrogate mother. Like Alia, Leto and Ghanima are \"pre-born\", having been awakened to adult consciousness and their genetic memories in the womb. The danger to individuals born this way, called Abomination by the Bene Gesserit, is that they are susceptible to being overtaken by their ancestral personas. Leto solves this problem by constructing his own personality out of an executive committee of his ancestors. Influenced by all the important ones, he cannot be possessed by an individual. Alia, however, is increasingly falling under the control of her late grandfather, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, whose hatred of the Atreides puts the twins in danger and threatens to topple Paul's empire. Deposed Emperor Shaddam IV's daughter Wensicia, Irulan's younger sister, plots from exile to place her son Farad'n on the throne and executes an assassination attempt on nine-year-old Leto and Ghanima. The twins anticipate and survive the plot. Leto leaves to seek out the mysterious Preacher, who some believe is Paul himself, and Ghanima hypnotizes herself to believe that Leto is dead. The intense mental discipline needed for this self-deception builds a safe haven in Ghanima's mind for her own personality to safely develop, with the persona of Chani acting as a guardian. Recognizing Alia as worsening threat, Fremen naib Stilgar takes Ghanima into hiding. Farad'n denounces his mother, and Alia, having retaken Ghanima, arranges a marriage between them. Knowing that Ghanima has sworn to kill him on their wedding night in revenge for Leto's \"death\", Alia intends to exploit the resulting chaos to weaken her enemies. Leto, having seen a prescient vision of humanity's only path to survival, has vowed to bring it to fruition and begun the necessary transformation to a human-sandworm hybrid. He returns to the capital where everyone has assembled for the wedding of Ghanima and Farad'n. Confronted by Leto and overcome by the Baron, Alia has a fleeting moment of self-control and leaps to her death. Leto declares himself Emperor, asserts control over the Fremen and restores Ghanima's genuine memories with a predetermined command. Farad'n pledges himself to Leto and delivers control of the remaining Sardaukar armies. Leto marries Ghanima to consolidate power, but Farad'n is her true consort so the Atreides line can continue.\nGhanima is portrayed by Jessica Brooks in the 2003 miniseries. Laura Fries of \"Variety\" wrote, \"the mini picks up a great deal of charisma when [James] McAvoy [as Leto] and Brooks come aboard as the next generation of the house of Atreides.\" The characters Leto and Ghanima were aged from ten-year-olds to teens for the miniseries, which Emmet Asher-Perrin of \"Tor.com\" called \"a smart move here, as finding two ten year old kids who had the ability to behave as though they had millennia of ancestral memory bubbling up inside of them was always going to be an impossibility.\" Asher-Perrin also called the rapport between Brooks and McAvoy \"dazzling\".\nTyekanik.\nTyekanik is a Sardaukar officer who serves Princess Wensicia in \"Children of Dune\". He is instrumental in her plot to assassinate the Atreides twins, Leto II and Ghanima, using mechanically controlled Laza tigers.\nTyekanik is portrayed by Marek Va\u0161ut in the 2003 miniseries.\nNamri.\nNamri is the Fremen naib of Sietch Fondak, formerly known as Sietch Jacurutu, in \"Children of Dune\". The Fremen of Fondak are called Iduali, or \"water stealers\", and shunned for a past transgression. Believing he is acting on orders from Lady Jessica, Gurney Halleck abducts a nine-year-old Leto II and brings him to Fondak, where Namri assists him in administering an overdose of the spice to Leto as a test. However, the test has actually been ordered by Leto's aunt Alia, possessed by the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, and Namri has been told to kill Leto no matter the result. Leto escapes and Namri attempts to kill Gurney, who kills him instead.\nNamri is portrayed by Predrag Bjelac in the 2003 miniseries.\nJavid.\nZiarenko Javid is the son of Namri and a High Priest of the Qizarate, the leaders of the religion which has risen around Paul Atreides. Possessed by the persona of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, Paul's sister Alia takes Javid as her lover, infuriating her husband, Duncan Idaho. Duncan later kills Javid publicly in Sietch Tabr, partly out of revenge and partly to manipulate Stilgar into killing Duncan as a means to force Stilgar to join the rebellion against Alia.\nJavid is portrayed by Rik Young in the 2003 miniseries.\nFarad'n.\nFarad'n is the son of Princess Wensicia, and the grandson of Shaddam IV. In \"Children of Dune\", Shaddam is dead and Wensicia plots from exile to restore House Corrino to its former glory by wresting control of the Imperial throne from the usurper, Paul Atreides, for Farad'n. She attempts to assassinate Leto II and Ghanima Atreides, Paul's twin heirs, and though she fails, Leto pretends to be dead to escape the increasingly murderous ambitions of his father's sister Alia. Paul and Alia's mother, Lady Jessica, trains Farad'n in the Bene Gesserit ways as a preamble to an offer to marry Ghanima and share the throne. His part of the deal is to \"denounce and banish\" Wensicia for Leto's murder, which he does, but Ghanima intends to murder Farad'n on their wedding night as revenge. Leto reappears, now beginning the transformation into a human-sandworm hybrid, and ascends the throne himself. Leto, who is now physically incapable of siring children, commands Farad'n to father the future Atreides line as Ghanima's mate. Farad'n is also appointed as the Royal Scribe and renamed \"Harq al'Ada\" (the \"breaker of habit\"), and relinquishes his control of the remaining Sardaukar to Leto, effectively surrendering House Corrino's claim to the Imperial throne. Many of the chapter epigraphs in the novel are from the later writings of Farad'n (as Harq al'Ada) in his role as chronicler of the reign of Leto II.\nFarad'n is portrayed by Jonathan Br\u00fc\u00fcn in the 2003 miniseries.\nIntroduced in \"God Emperor of Dune\" (1981).\nSiona Atreides.\nSiona Atreides is the daughter of God Emperor Leto II's attendant and confidant Moneo, and a direct descendant of Leto's twin sister Ghanima and Farad'n Corrino. In \"God Emperor of Dune\", Siona objects to Leto's tyrannical stranglehold on civilization, and leads a group of like-minded dissidents determined to depose Leto by any means necessary. Leto allows her to steal secret records from his archives, and she loses ten of her cohorts to Leto's D-wolves, barely escaping with her own life. Forced to join the Fish Speakers, an all-female army who obey Leto without question, Siona is further bristled by Leto's obvious desire to breed her with the latest Duncan Idaho ghola. Leto, who over the millennia has become a human-sandworm hybrid thanks to his fusion with sandtrout, the larval stage of sandworms, tests Siona by taking her out to the middle of the desert. She is careless in the use of her stillsuit to preserve moisture, and dehydration forces her to accept Leto's offer of spice essence from his body to replenish her. Awakened to Leto's Golden Path, the prophetic vision he follows to avert humanity's complete destruction, Siona is convinced of its importance, and better understands why he has ruled so harshly. But she remains dedicated to Leto's destruction, and an errant rainstorm demonstrates for her his mortal vulnerability to water. Leto has planned a Royal Procession to travel to his wedding to the Ixian ambassador Hwi Noree, and Siona and Idaho overcome a searing mutual hatred of each other to plan his assassination. As the procession moves across a high bridge over the Idaho River, Siona's associate, the Fish Speaker Nayla, destroys the support beams with a lasgun. The bridge collapses and Leto's entourage, including Hwi, plunge to their deaths into the river below. Leto's body rends apart in the water, the outer layer of sandtrout encysting the water and scurrying off, while the rest burns and disintegrates on the shore. A dying Leto reveals a secret aspect of his Golden Path: Siona is the result of a breeding scheme to produce a human who is invisible to prescient vision. Siona and her descendants will possess this ability, and Leto explains that humanity is now free from the domination of oracles, free to scatter throughout the universe, never again to face complete domination or complete destruction. After revealing the location of his secret spice hoard, Leto dies, leaving Duncan and Siona to face the task of managing the empire.\nHwi Noree.\nHwi Noree is the Ixian ambassador to Arrakis, and the niece of Malky, a previous Ixian ambassador who had been close to Leto II. In \"God Emperor of Dune\", Leto is enchanted by the beautiful and charismatic Hwi, and though he realizes she has been specifically designed and trained to ensnare him, he cannot resist falling in love with her. Raised in secret in a no-chamber, she has been bred to appeal to what remains of Leto's humanity, a process guided by Malky himself. Though his transformation into a human-sandworm hybrid makes him incapable of physical intimacy, Leto proposes marriage and Hwi agrees. Duncan Idaho also falls in love with Hwi, and they fall into bed together. The resulting rivalry only worsens the rift between Leto and Duncan, who is driven to join Siona in her assassination plot against Leto. Hwi dies with Leto when their wedding procession crosses a sabotaged bridge, which collapses into the Idaho River below.\nAnteac.\nBene Gesserit Truthsayer Tertius Eileen Anteac comes to Arrakis with Luyseyal in \"God Emperor of Dune\" for an audience with the God Emperor Leto II that coincides with the Royal Festival held every ten years. They receive a message from Othwi Yake, Assistant to the Ixian ambassador, that Face Dancers have infiltrated the Ixian embassy, and are planning to assassinate Leto II. They try to warn Leto, but the message does not reach his convoy in time, though the plot fails, as Anteac and Luyseyal knew it would. They achieve little in their meeting with Leto II, and he takes the priceless vial of spice-essence with which they hoped to test his mortality. Leto reminds Luyseyal of the lesson learned from past over-machined societies: \"The devices themselves condition the users to employ each other the way they employ machines.\" Later, Leto enlists Anteac's aid in detecting the Face Dancers, who by that time have replaced everyone in the Ixian embassy except the new ambassador, Hwi Noree. In particular, Anteac identifies the duplicate of Yake, who has been killed and replicated since the original sent his warning to Anteac. Leto's chief minister Moneo Atreides suggests to the God Emperor that Anteac is a secret Mentat, a skill prohibited in the Empire by Leto himself. Leto agrees but says that it amuses him. Hwi shares her knowledge of the environment in which she was brought up with Anteac, who has been conscripted by Leto to lead a Fish Speaker assault on Ix to wrest the secret of Hwi's origins. Anteac is shocked at the knowledge that Hwi is to marry Leto, and at the same time annoyed that The Bene Gesserit had allowed so talented a woman as Hwi to pass through their training program without turning her into one of them. With Anteac's faithful assistance, Leto's forces successfully invade Ix and capture Malky, Hwi's uncle and Leto's former friend, but Anteac is killed.\nSome 1,500 years later in \"Chapterhouse: Dune\" the Duncan Idaho ghola recalls his past incarnation from the time of Leto II, noting that he had met with Anteac on orders from the God Emperor to suppress the Mentat school the Bene Gesserit had hidden on Wallach IX. It is also revealed that Reverend Mother Bellonda is a descendant of Anteac's.\nMoneo Atreides.\nMoneo Atreides is Leto II's longtime majordomo and close confidant, the descendant of one of the Duncan Idaho gholas, the father of Siona with the Fish Speaker Seyefa, and a direct descendant of Leto's twin sister Ghanima and Farad'n Corrino. Like Siona, he was rebellious as a young man, leading a group of rebels dedicated to ending Leto's oppressive reign. He recognized that eliminating Leto would cast the universe into chaos, but that it would prompt a beneficial rebirth for humanity. In \"God Emperor of Dune\", Moneo has long given up these efforts and now serves Leto with the utmost dedication, having seen the Golden Path for himself and recognized its importance in saving humanity from destruction. Moneo is killed during Leto's assassination, orchestrated by Siona and Duncan, when the bridge that Leto's procession is crossing is destroyed.\nNayla.\nNayla is a fanatical Fish Speaker in the service of the God Emperor. Knowing of Siona Atreides and Duncan Idaho's plot against him, Leto has instructed Nayla to follow any order Siona gives her. When Siona tasks Nayla to assist in Leto's assassination by sabotaging the bridge he is traveling on, Nayla complies with fervor, damaging the supports with a lasgun. Leto, Hwi Noree and Moneo Atreides are among those killed in the collapse, and Duncan kills Nayla for her role in Hwi's death.\nChenoeh.\nQuintinius Violet Chenoeh, specially trained as an oral recorder, is sent by Syaksa to Arrakis with Tawsuoko on a fact-gathering mission in the same year as Anteac, prior to the events \"God Emperor of Dune\". She is invited to converse with the God Emperor himself, and he is uncharacteristically indulgent of her questions and somewhat generous with his own information, however cryptic. Leto tells Chenoeh that he plans to restore \"outward spiritual freedom\" for mankind, and then refers to Siona Atreides as his \"achievement\", which the Sisterhood correctly interprets as being related to Leto's own breeding program. Leto then says, \"You will return to your Superiors with my message, but these words keep secret for now. I will visit my rage upon your Sisterhood if you fail.\" Chenoeh complies, following Syaksa's own warning: \"You must do nothing which will bring down his wrath upon us.\" Leto relates how he and his sister Ghanima were able to escape the disaster of Abomination, and also makes one of the earliest references to his secret journals, later found at Dar-es-Balat. He knows he will ultimately be perceived as a tyrant, and wishes to preserve his \"feelings and motives... lest history distort them too much.\" At the same time, he warns \"Beware of \"the\" truth,\" and shares what he calls \"the greatest mystery of all time\" by which he composes his life: \"The only past which endures lies wordlessly within you.\" Leto tells Chenoeh that by virtue of his taking her into his confidence, \"You will become here an integral part of my myth. Our distant cousins will pray to you for intercession with me!\" He also foretells her later death during her attempt at becoming a Reverend Mother through the spice agony. Chenoeh's account of their secret conversation is found after her death, and it is later noted that \"the persistent Cult of Sister Chenoeh assumes new significance because of the journals' disclosures.\" Chenoeh and Tawsuoko also bring back to Chapterhouse proof (in the form of a written eyewitness account of Leto's statement) that, as rumored, Leto executed nine historians four centuries prior.\nIntroduced in \"Heretics of Dune\" (1984).\nLucilla.\nLucilla is a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother and Imprinter. In \"Heretics of Dune\", Bene Gesserit Mother Superior Taraza sends the young and attractive Lucilla to Gammu, formerly the Harkonnen homeworld Giedi Prime, to teach the teenage Duncan Idaho ghola whom the Sisterhood is raising there. Lucilla is also tasked with binding his loyalty to her, and thus the Bene Gesserit, through imprinting, while also protecting him from the negative influence\u2014and possible peril\u2014presented by dissenting Bene Gesserit who believe the ghola is a danger to the Sisterhood. Extremely precocious and already having divined the fact that he is a ghola, the young Duncan nurses hatred for the Bene Gesserit, hoping to escape their control of his life. He soon blossoms, however, under the training of Lucilla and Miles Teg, a male military commander of the Bene Gesserit brought out of retirement in part to protect the ghola. An attempt is made on Duncan's life, and Teg and Lucilla flee with Duncan into the countryside. They hide in a forgotten Harkonnen no-globe, during which time Teg is able to awaken Duncan to his original memories. This occurs before Lucilla has imprinted the ghola, and his new self-awareness now makes it impossible for her to attempt it. Teg arranges an extraction by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Burzmali, but they are ambushed, and Teg sacrifices himself to capture while Lucilla and Duncan escape. Duncan attempts to get off Gammu undetected in the guise of a diminutive Tleilaxu Master, but is taken hostage. Lucilla and Burzmali arrive at a Bene Gesserit safehouse, but discover that it has been taken over by the fearsome Honored Matres, a violent matriarchal order from the farthest reaches of the universe who have been wreaking havoc and destruction on Tleilaxu worlds. Lucilla manages to impersonate an Honored Matre as one of their number, escaping with Duncan and an Honored Matre prisoner, Murbella. Teg commandeers an Honored Matre no-ship and flees with Lucilla, Duncan and a captive Murbella.\nIn \"Chapterhouse: Dune\", Lucilla has been transferred to the planet Lampadas to oversee a Bene Gesserit education center located there. She manages to escape before the Honored Matres destroy the planet, carrying the shared memories of its millions of Reverend Mothers. Her ship is damaged by a mine and she is forced to land on Gammu, where she takes refuge with a hidden colony of Jews, knowing that they will be sympathetic to her. The Jews had fled Earth thousands of years earlier in order to escape relentless persecution, and they now practice their religion in secret to maintain their ties to ancient history. The Bene Gesserit, with their own method of connecting to their past, have cultivated a relationship with the Jews. The leader of this settlement gives Lucilla shelter, but ultimately has to turn her over to the Honored Matres in order to save his people from destruction at their hands. Before doing so, however, he introduces Lucilla to Rebecca, a \"wild\" Reverend Mother who has gained her Other Memories without Bene Gesserit training. Lucilla shares minds with Rebecca, who promises to take the memories of Lampadas safely back to the Sisterhood. The Honored Matres capture Lucilla and bring her before the Great Honored Matre Dama, who surprises everyone present by declining to kill her outright. Dama tries to persuade Lucilla to join the Honored Matres, preserving her life in exchange for Bene Gesserit secrets. Dama is especially interested in the Bene Gesserit ability to modify their biochemistry and render toxins harmless, prompting Lucilla to speculate that the Honored Matres were driven out of the Scattering by an enemy who used biological weapons. These conversations with Lucilla continue for weeks, and she reveals to Dama that, although the Bene Gesserit know how to manipulate and control the populace, they practice and believe in democracy. Dama's desire to destroy the Sisterhood is redoubled when she discovers that the Bene Gesserit teach this dangerous knowledge, and she kills Lucilla.\nLucilla is described as a near copy of the elite Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade, from her physical appearance to the sound of her voice. The two women are not directly related, but are instead the products of parallel breeding lines.\nMiles Teg.\nMiles Teg is a Mentat and the former Supreme Bashar of the Bene Gesserit, their leading military commander. In \"Heretics of Dune\", Bene Gesserit Mother Superior Taraza summons Teg out of retirement to take over the weapons training of the newest Duncan Idaho ghola, still a teenager, on Gammu. Teg, Duncan and Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Lucilla flee an attempt on Duncan's life, and hide in a long-forgotten Harkonnen no-globe discovered by Teg's aide, Patrin. Teg uses his strong resemblance to his ancestor Duke Leto Atreides, to whom the original Idaho was fiercely loyal, and a variety of relentless physical and mental attacks to awaken Duncan to his original memories. Teg arranges an extraction by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Burzmali, but they are ambushed, and Teg sacrifices himself to capture by the Honored Matres to allow Lucilla and Duncan to escape. Teg is tortured using a T-Probe, and under the severe stress and agony produced by the probe's attempts to gain control of his body and his knowledge, his Mentat abilities and Atreides genes elevate him to a higher level of being. He is able to move faster than the eye can see by accelerating his metabolism, and he gains mild prescience, which he describes as a doubled vision which gives him intimations of danger. His accelerated speed comes at the cost of incredible energy expenditure, requiring him to consume enormous amounts of food. After escaping his captors, he finds that his safehouse had been taken over by Honored Matres, who attempt to gain his allegiance. Seeing the terrible state their constant drive for power and contempt for the masses has lowered them to, he uses his incredible speed to slaughter them and escape once more. Teg gathers a force of veterans who had served under him on previous campaigns from the bars of Ysai and captures an Honored Matre no-ship using his tactical genius and new abilities. He flees the planet with Lucilla, Duncan and a captive Honored Matre, Murbella. Journeying to Rakis, Teg hands off Duncan and Lucilla to the Bene Gesserits Sheeana and Darwi Odrade, the latter of which is revealed to be his daughter. As the others escape, Teg goads the Honored Matres, who incinerate the entire planet with their Obliterator weapons to be sure Teg is killed.\nA ghola of Teg is birthed in \"Chapterhouse: Dune\" on orders from Odrade, who is now Mother Superior of the Bene Gesserit after Taraza's death in the battle at Rakis. Odrade needs Teg's military abilities to thwart the worsening threat of the Honored Matres. The Bene Gesserit later reawaken him to his full memories prematurely by using Sheeana to imprint him. As the original Teg has been trained by his mother to resist such manipulation, the attempt subjects the Teg ghola to a heightened amount of stress which also unlocks the superhuman abilities previously acquired by Teg under Honored Matre torture. A reawakened Teg leads the final assault upon the Honored Matres, but is captured when the Matres pretend to surrender. Murbella, a captive Honored Matre indoctrinated into the Bene Gesserit, kills the Honored Matre leader Logno at the same time Bene Gesserit Mother Superior Odrade is killed, and Murbella manages to secure the leadership of both groups. Teg is released, later joining Sheeana and Duncan Idaho when they escape Bene Gesserit control in a no-ship.\nThe adult Teg is described as 296 years old but still vital, and has a striking resemblance to his ancestor, Leto Atreides. The son of the Bene Gesserit Lady Janet Roxbrough (a Fish Speaker descendant) and Loschy Teg, a \"CHOAM station factor\" who was chosen for breeding by the Sisterhood for his \"gene potential,\" Miles had been instructed in the Bene Gesserit ways by his mother before being sent to Lampadas to train as a Mentat. Teg is a military genius, having a very strong sense of honor, loyalty, and many of the characteristics of House Atreides, his ancestors. He is well known for doing the unexpected. Teg is also not a spice addict, as is common with most other people, not even resorting to the spice at old age when most others might wish to use it to extend their lives. By the time of \"Heretics of Dune\", Teg's wife had been dead for 38 years, his grown children living elsewhere except for his eldest daughter Dimela. She and her husband Firus take control of Teg's farm when he leaves his homeworld Lernaeus, and the couple have three children. Teg had a younger brother, Sabine, who had been poisoned on Romo. In \"Heretics of Dune\", it is revealed that Teg had fathered other children during his younger years, one of whom is Odrade.\nTeg also appears in the sequel novels \"Hunters of Dune\" and \"Sandworms of Dune\" by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. In \"Hunters of Dune\", Duncan and Teg run the affairs on the no-ship, being the only two passengers with experience in military leadership. Teg considers himself responsible for the security of the ship and its vital cargo of historical gholas, produced in transit from genetic material possessed by captive passenger Scytale, purportedly the last Tleilaxu Master. In \"Sandworms of Dune\", mysterious saboteurs conduct crippling attacks on the no-ship's systems. Teg and Duncan discover that Face Dancers have infiltrated the ship, but not before they are led directly to the \"Unknown Enemy\" who have been stalking the ship for years: Daniel and Marty, incarnations of the ancient thinking machines Omnius and Erasmus. The critically damaged no-ship is caught in the thinking machine tachyon net, and Teg uses his accelerated metabolism to both repair the ship and launch countermeasures against the attacking machines. Though he has consumed vast quantities of melange and carbohydrates from the ship's stores to complete his task, Teg dies from massive cellular exhaustion. Duncan is unable to free the ship, and it is taken to the machine world Synchrony. En route, Duncan and Sheeana release the husk that is left of Teg's body into space, vowing that the Bashar will never be captured by the Enemy. Later, after the machines are defeated, Duncan asks Scytale for a new ghola of Teg, whom he will need at his side in his new position as the bridge between both mankind and machines.\nMurbella.\nMurbella is a young Honored Matre who defects to the Bene Gesserit. In \"Heretics of Dune\", the violent Honored Matres capture the teenage Duncan Idaho ghola, who is loyal to their enemies, the Bene Gesserit. Young Honored Matre Murbella is tasked to use her sexual imprinting talents to enslave Duncan to force his allegiance to them. The Tleilaxu have secretly programmed the ghola with the male equivalent to the Honored Matres' imprinting power, which is unlocked by Murbella's attempt. Duncan and Murbella imprint each other, and in her weakened condition Murbella is easily captured by the Bene Gesserit. Her new addiction to Duncan keeps Murbella subdued, and Bene Gesserit soon begin to train her as one of them, though they do not completely trust her. In \"Chapterhouse: Dune\", Duncan and Murbella's mutual imprinting has made them reluctant lovers. Murbella collapses under the pressure of training and her pregnancy, but realizes that she admires and wants to be Bene Gesserit. Murbella submits to the spice agony to become a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother, and survives. During a Bene Gesserit attack on the Honored Matres, Murbella kills the Great Honored Matre Logno with her Bene Gesserit-enhanced fighting skills, and the Honored Matres are awed by her physical prowess. The Bene Gesserit Mother Superior Darwi Odrade is also killed, and Murbella secures the leadership of both groups, per Odrade's plan. Murbella intends to merge the two orders into a New Sisterhood, which displeases some of the Bene Gesserit. The dissenters flee Chapterhouse with Duncan, Miles Teg, and Sheeana in a no-ship, and Murbella realizes their plan too late to stop them.\nMurbella also appears in the sequel novels \"Hunters of Dune\" and \"Sandworms of Dune\" by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. In \"Hunters of Dune\", Murbella takes the title Mother Commander. She has four daughters by Duncan: Rinya, Janess, Tanidia and Gianne. Murbella searches her Other Memory for the origin of the Honored Matres. She discovers that they are descendants of rogue Bene Gesserits and Tleilaxu females, originally used as axlotl tanks and freed by Fish Speakers, who allied in the Scattering. Murbella also discovers that the Honored Matres' \"outside enemy\" are thinking machines, provoked when the Honored Matres stole technologically advanced weapons, including Obliterators, from them. In \"Sandworms of Dune\", Murbella now knows that the sentient computer network Omnius and his thinking machine forces are coming, and attempts to rally humankind for a last stand against the thinking machines. She commissions the scientists of Ix to copy the destructive Obliterators for use on the fleet of warships she has ordered from the Spacing Guild. However, Ix is now secretly controlled by Face Dancer leader Khrone. When Murbella is ready to launch her fleet, the Obliterators and Ixian navigation devices all suddenly fail, which Murbella realizes is sabotage. The Oracle of Time appears, destroying Omnius and the thinking machines with her own armada. Murbella is reunited with Duncan, who intends to end the divide between humans and thinking machines, allowing the two to co-exist.\nDarwi Odrade.\nDarwi Odrade is an elite Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother and Atreides descendant. In \"Heretics of Dune\", the \"wild talents\" of the Atreides bloodline that Odrade displays intermittently are what the Bene Gesserit both fear and desperately need. The suspicious Reverend Mother Bellonda scrutinizes Odrade continually, looking for reasons to terminate her, while Mother Superior Taraza senses that the Sisterhood needs Odrade's limited Atreides prescience to avert imminent destruction at the hands of the Honored Matres. Taraza tasks Odrade to take over the Bene Gesserit Keep on the planet Arrakis, and take under her protection the foundling girl Sheeana, who has the natural ability to control the giant sandworms. Recognizing Sheeana's value to the Sisterhood, Odrade begins training her as a Bene Gesserit acolyte. Meanwhile, an anonymous document referred to as the Atreides Manifesto surfaces, attacking all religions in the known universe except for that of the Bene Tleilax. This creates a furor with the intensely religious Tleilaxu, who have long nursed dreams of hegemony, dominating the universe with their religion. The Tleilaxu council decides to treat the Manifesto as a gift from God, and they spread it far and wide. It is later revealed that the Manifesto was in fact written by Odrade. When Taraza is killed after a showdown with the Honored Matres on Arrakis, Odrade becomes Mother Superior.\nIn \"Chapterhouse Dune\" (1985), Odrade is accompanied by Tamalane, Dortujla and the acolyte Suipol to meet the Great Honored Matre Dama on Junction, as retired Bene Gesserit Supreme Bashar Miles Teg leads a force to attack Gammu. With the planet about to fall, the Honored Matres activate their \"weapon of last resort\", turning victory into defeat and holding Odrade captive. Tamalane, Dortujla, and Suipol are killed. As planned with Odrade previously, Honored Matre-turned-Bene Gesserit Murbella travels to Junction alone, pretending to have escaped the Bene Gesserit with their unique abilities and the location of their hidden homeworld, Chapterhouse. Murbella is brought before the new Great Honored Matre Logno, who has just killed her predecessor Dama and has Odrade standing nearby, unrestrained in a gesture of contempt. Murbella provokes and kills Logno, while simultaneously the Honored Matre Elpek kills Odrade. With both of these deaths, Murbella becomes the new Mother Superior as well as Great Honored Matre, fulfilling Odrade's intentions.\nOdrade is secretly the daughter of military commander Teg, and her \"care with details\" makes her, like Teg, most suited for duties related to security. The younger Reverend Mother and Imprinter Lucilla is described a near copy of Odrade, from her physical appearance to the sound of her voice. The two women are not directly related, but are instead the products of parallel breeding lines. As the Bene Gesserit are wary of the historical unpredictability of Atreides genes, it is noted in \"Heretics of Dune\" that her offspring receive \"careful examination\", and that \"two of those offspring had been quietly put to death.\"\nSheeana.\nSheeana Brugh is a young girl native to Rakis (formerly Arrakis) who possesses the unique ability to control the giant sandworms that roam the desert planet. In \"Heretics of Dune\", Sheeana's talent is revealed after her impoverished village is wiped out by a sandworm which refuses to harm her, and then whisks her to the capital city of Keen (formerly Arrakeen) when she climbs on to its back in the long-forbidden Fremen tradition. Sheeana is soon recognized as the \"sandrider\" predicted by the Leto II, and worshipped by the priesthood of Rakis. As she matures to adulthood, Sheeana effectively assumes control of the priesthood. Her popularity and religious aura have increased both on and off Rakis, and the priests, believing her a prophet, are compelled to follow even her most unorthodox commands. The Bene Gesserit, who have their own plans for Sheeana and have secretly guided her education, thwart an assassination attempt on her, and unofficially take control of Sheeana, the priesthood and Rakis. Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade begins Sheeana's formal Bene Gesserit training. Mother Superior Taraza is soon pleased with Sheeana's progress, and considers a secondary plan of seeding other planets with sandworms with Sheeana's help. Rakis itself is destroyed by the vengeful Honored Matres. In \"Chapterhouse: Dune\", Sheeana is now in charge of the project to breed sandworms on the secret Bene Gesserit world, Chapterhouse. She becomes a full Reverend Mother but remains very independent, with mysterious depths. Disagreeing with the plans of new Bene Gesserit leader Murbella, Sheeana chooses to escape Chapterhouse on an untraceable no-ship with the like-minded Duncan Idaho ghola and a number of other passengers.\nSheeana also appears in the sequel novels \"Hunters of Dune\" and \"Sandworms of Dune\" by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.\nIn \"Hunters of Dune\", Sheeana and Duncan lead the no-ship in their journey to flee the Unknown Enemy that pursues them. Sheeana decides that they need to make new gholas of former heroes using the genetic material carried by the last Tleilaxu Master, Scytale.\nTylwyth Waff.\nTylwyth Waff is a Tleilaxu Master and the leader of the Bene Tleilax, a secretive race of genetic manipulators who traffic in biological products such as artificial eyes, gholas, and \"twisted\" Mentats. Waff is described as \"an elfin figure barely a meter and a half tall. Eyes, hair, and skin were shades of gray, all a stage for the oval face with its tiny mouth and line of sharp teeth\". In \"Heretics of Dune\", Waff successfully replaces High Priest Hedley Tuek with a Face Dancer duplicate loyal to the Tleilaxi, but loses control of the impostor due to its eventual complete assimilation into its new form. Traveling to Rakis, Waff decides to ally with the Bene Gesserit after he is tricked into believing that they share the secret religious beliefs of the Tleilaxu. He is killed along with the entire population of Rakis when the Honored Matres destroy the planet in revenge for Miles Teg's slaughter of their members. Meanwhile, he has a replacement ghola growing for himself in Bandalong, the capital city of the Tleilaxu homeworld, Tleilax.\nWaff also appears in the sequel novels \"Hunters of Dune\" and \"Sandworms of Dune\" by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. In \"Hunters of Dune\", the Honored Matres who conquered Tleilax have kept several of Waff's gholas alive, but in vegetative states. In order to recover the supposedly \"lost\" secret to producing melange in axlotl tanks, the Lost Tleilaxu scribe Uxtal is tasked to create new gholas from Waff's genetic material. Uxtal accelerates the process artificially, and of the first batch of eight Waff gholas, seven fail to regain their memories and are viciously killed. The massacre shocks the last ghola into regaining some of Waff's memories, but not enough to recreate the melange process. Later, the Waff ghola escapes the Bene Gesserit attack on Tleilax, finding refuge with the Spacing Guild by offering Guild Navigator Edrik the genetic knowledge for the Guild to create their own, optimized sandworms to produce melange. In \"Sandworms of Dune\", Waff alters the DNA of the sandworm's larval sandtrout stage to create an aquatic form of the worms, which are then released into the oceans of Buzzell. Adapting to their new environment, these \"seaworms\" quickly flourish, eventually producing a highly concentrated form of melange, dubbed \"ultraspice\". Waff makes a pilgrimage to Rakis, original homeworld of the sandworms, and sacrifices himself to a worm, which to him is an embodiment of God.\nBellonda.\nBellonda is a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother and the chief Mentat-Archivist counselor to Mother Superior Taraza in \"Heretics of Dune\". After Taraza's death, Bellonda serves new Mother Superior Darwi Odrade in the same function in \"Chapterhouse: Dune\". During a conversation with the Duncan Idaho ghola it is revealed that Bellonda is a descendant of Anteac, an important Reverend Mother from the time of the God Emperor Leto II.\nBellonda also appears in the sequel novel \"Hunters of Dune\" by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. In the novel, Bellonda is one of the few Bene Gesserit with access to the Bene Gesserit's sensitive breeding records, and one of even fewer possessing the memories of all the Mothers Superior. Bellonda suspects that the Honored Matres had originally been Reverend Mothers sent out in the Scattering, and calculates that melange withdrawal and hypnosis had caused them to deny their origins. Bellonda is later killed in a duel by her Spice Operations Director partner and nemesis, the former Honored Matre Doria. An outraged Mother Commander Murbella, leader of the merged New Sisterhood of Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres, forces Doria to share minds with Bellonda before her memories are lost forever.\nTaraza.\nAlma Mavis Taraza is the Bene Gesserit Mother Superior in \"Heretics of Dune\" who brings former Supreme Bashar Miles Teg reluctantly out of retirement to guard the latest Duncan Idaho ghola. Taraza blackmails Tleilaxu Master Waff to find out all he knows about the invading Honored Matres, as well as the fact that the Bene Tleilax have programmed their own agenda within the ghola. She also manages to divine that Waff is a secret Zensufi, which finally gives the Sisterhood a way to manipulate the Tleilaxu. Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade subsequently uses this knowledge of Waff's religious beliefs to form an alliance with him. As Tleilaxu axlotl tanks are the only other source of melange besides Rakis, this alliance will be essential when Taraza executes her ultimate plan: to destroy Rakis and free humanity from Leto II's own plan. The discovery of a girl with the ability to control sandworms prompts Taraza to consider a secondary plan of seeding other planets with them. The Honored Matres are goaded into attacking Rakis and Taraza is killed, but not before she is able to share Other Memory with Odrade, who escapes.\nBurzmali.\nAlef Burzmali is Miles Teg's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in the Bene Gesserit military who became Supreme Bashar after Teg's retirement. In \"Heretics of Dune\", he aids Teg in extracting the Duncan Idaho ghola and Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Lucilla from their hiding place on Gammu. When Duncan is captured by the Honored Matres, Lucilla impersonates one of them, with Burzmali playing her sexual slave, to access the building where Duncan is being held. Burzmali dies attempting to protect the planet Lampadas from a catastrophic attack by Honored Matres in \"Chapterhouse Dune\".\nHedley Tuek.\nHedley Tuek is the High Priest of the Rakian Priesthood, and a descendant of the melange smuggler Esmar Tuek. Tleilaxu Master Waff has Tuek killed and replaced by a Face Dancer, a genetically engineered mimic, but loses control of the duplicate due to its eventual complete assimilation into its new form.\nIntroduced in \"Chapterhouse: Dune\" (1985).\nRebecca.\nRebecca is a \"wild\" Reverend Mother who lives among a secret community of Jews on Gammu. In \"Chapterhouse: Dune\", Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Lucilla is fleeing the destruction of the planet Lampadas by the Honored Matres and is forced to land on Gammu. Once there, she seeks out a hidden settlement of Jews, whom she knows will give her sanctuary. They are obligated to turn her over to the Honored Matres to assure their own survival, but Lucilla, who is carrying the priceless shared-minds of all the Reverend Mothers of Lampadas, is able to share minds with Rebecca and pass on this knowledge before being captured by the Honored Matres. Rebecca and the Jews eventually escape Gammu with the Bene Gesserit forces, and Rebecca is able to pass on the 7,622,014 Lampadas shared-minds to the Sisterhood.\nIn the sequel novel \"Hunters of Dune\" by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, Rebecca is aboard the untraceable no-ship which Sheeana and Duncan Idaho use to flee the Bene Gesserit planet Chapterhouse. Rebecca later offers herself as a volunteer to become one of the axlotl tanks used to produce the important gholas of Paul Atreides, Leto II and others.\nDaniel and Marty.\nDaniel and Marty are a pair of mysterious observers with advanced technological powers introduced in \"Chapterhouse: Dune\". Duncan Idaho sees the duo in a vision and determines that they are likely Face Dancers, the shapeshifting minions of the Tleilaxu, though atypically autonomous ones. In the final chapter of the novel, Daniel and Marty observe the escape of the no-ship from Chapterhouse and confirm that they are independent Face Dancers. They acknowledge that Tleilaxu Masters created them and express some deference, but also assert their independence and indicate that their ability to absorb the memories and experiences of other people made their autonomy inevitable. Daniel and Marty hint that they observe and are familiar with various groups in the universe, and allude to their desire to capture and study the passengers of the no-ship.\nHerbert's 1986 death \"left fans with an \u00fcber-cliffhanger\" for twenty years, until his son Brian Herbert and author Kevin J. Anderson published two sequels to the original series, \"Hunters of Dune\" and \"Sandworms of Dune\".\nIn \"Hunters of Dune\", Daniel and Marty are in constant pursuit of the escaped no-ship, on which they believe is the Kwisatz Haderach they require to be victorious in the imminent and long-foretold \"battle at the end of the universe\" known as kralizec. Their Face Dancer minion Khrone is executing a parallel plan to create their own Kwisatz Haderach, using a Paul Atreides ghola that will be conditioned by a ghola of the Baron Harkonnen. Daniel and Marty themselves have the ability to create illusions, and to inflict pain on any human. It is eventually revealed that Daniel and Marty are not, in fact, Face Dancers: they are actually incarnations of the thinking machines Omnius (Daniel) and Erasmus (Marty), introduced in the \"Legends of Dune\" prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Anderson. In the third \"Legends\" novel \"\", Omnius had sent out a last blast of information before being destroyed in the Battle of Corrin. This signal had eventually connected with one of the probes disseminated from Giedi Prime several years earlier, uploading versions of Erasmus and Omnius.\nIn \"Sandworms of Dune\", Omnius and Erasmus finally capture the no-ship and pit the Paul ghola on board against their own twisted version, Paolo, in a duel to the death that will leave them with the strongest of the two. Paul survives, but realizes that Duncan is actually the \"ultimate Kwisatz Haderach\" that Omnius has been seeking. The Oracle of Time, the immortal founder of the Spacing Guild, transports every aspect of the Omnius network into another dimension forever. Erasmus offers Duncan the choice between continuing their war or ending it. Duncan chooses peace over victory, and he and Erasmus merge minds. Erasmus imparts Duncan with all the codes required to run the Synchronized Worlds, as well as all of Erasmus' knowledge, setting Duncan as the bridge between humans and machines to permanently end the divide and ensure that the two may co-exist. With little left for him, Erasmus again expresses his desire to learn everything possible about what it is to be human\u2014and asks Duncan to deactivate him so that he may experience \"death\".\nWilliam F. Touponce states unequivocally that Daniel and Marty are Face Dancers in his 1988 book \"Frank Herbert\", explaining \"Herbert gives us a segment narrated from their point of view only at the very end of the novel. They are offshoots of the Tleilaxu Face Dancers sent out in The Scattering and have become almost godlike because of their capacity to assume the persona of whoever they kill\u2014and they have been doing this for centuries, capturing Mentats and Tleilaxu Masters and whatever else they could assimilate, until now they play with whole planets and civilizations. They are weirdly benign when they first appear in the visions of Duncan Idaho as a calm elderly couple working in a flower garden, trying to capture him in their net\". In an August 2007 review of \"Sandworms of Dune\", John C. Snider of SciFiDimensions.com argues that it \"doesn't fit\" or \"add up\" that Frank Herbert's Daniel and Marty are the \"malevolent\" thinking machines Brian Herbert and Anderson created in their \"Legends of Dune\" prequel novels. He further wonders why \"Omnius, long established as puzzled by and averse to human unpredictability, would want to breed that ultimate ungovernable\u2014a Kwisatz Haderach\".\nDama.\nGreat Honored Matre Dama is the Honored Matre leader on Junction in \"Chapterhouse Dune\", and is called the \"Spider Queen\" by the Bene Gesserit leader Darwi Odrade. Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Lucilla flees the destruction of Lampadas by the Honored Matres, but is forced to land on Gammu. She is captured and brought before Dama, but not killed outright. Dama tries to persuade Lucilla to join the Honored Matres, preserving her life in exchange for Bene Gesserit secrets. Dama does not try to hide the fact that the Matres dearly want to learn to modify their biochemistry as the Bene Gesserit do. These conversations with Lucilla continue for weeks. When she reveals to Dama that, although the Bene Gesserit know how to manipulate and control the populace, they practice and believe in democracy, Dama's desire to destroy the Sisterhood is redoubled when she discovers the Bene Gesserit teach this dangerous knowledge. Dama kills Lucilla, and then meets with Mother Superior Odrade. Dama at first seems surprisingly cooperative, but Odrade soon realizes that Dama intends no reasonable negotiation. Under cover of Odrade's diplomacy, the Bene Gesserit forces under Miles Teg attack Junction with tremendous force. Dama's chief advisor Logno assassinates Dama with poison, and assumes control of the Honored Matres.\nLogno.\nLogno is the chief advisor to Great Honored Matre Dama on Junction. In \"Chapterhouse Dune\", Logno assassinates Dama with poison while the Bene Gesserit forces are attacking Junction. Logno assumes control of the Honored Matres and immediately surrenders. Bene Gesserit leader Odrade is surprised, but she and Miles Teg soon realize they have fallen into a trap. The Honored Matres use a weapon of mass destruction and turn defeat into victory. Murbella saves as much of the Bene Gesserit force as she can, and they begin to withdraw to Chapterhouse. Odrade, however, had planned for the possible failure of the Bene Gesserit attack and left Murbella instructions for a last desperate gamble. Murbella pilots a small craft down to the surface, announcing herself as an Honored Matre who, in the confusion, has managed to escape the Bene Gesserit with all their secrets. She arrives on the planet and immediately announces her intentions by killing an overeager Honored Matre with blinding speed enhanced by Bene Gesserit training that makes her faster than any Honored Matre before her. Murbella is taken to Logno, and immediately declares herself hostile. Logno cannot help herself and attacks, and Murbella handily kills her and some of her allies. Murbella takes charge of the Honored Matres, who are awed by her physical prowess.\nDortujla.\nDortujla is the head of the Bene Gesserit keep on the cold aquatic planet Buzzell, having been sent there as punishment for the so-called \"Jessica crime\"\u2014a love affair, forbidden by the Bene Gesserit as a weakness that could compromise their performance. In \"Chapterhouse: Dune\", Dortujla comes to Odrade on Chapterhouse to report that humanoid Handlers and their half-man/half-cat enslaved Futars have offered alliance against the Honored Matres, who have yet to make a move on Buzzell. Dortujla's Mentat analysis, however, suggests that the Handlers somehow intend dominance, and that the Matres intend to colonize Buzzell. Odrade sees an opportunity, and orders Dortujla to return to Buzzell and make contact with the Honored Matres, brokering a meeting between Odrade and their leader in which the Bene Gesserit will supposedly surrender. Dortujla is tortured by the Honored Matres and forced to watch her party be murdered and fed to captive Futars. However, she witnesses a Futar using its immobilizing scream, which has \"qualities of Voice\", against the Honored Matres. Later, Dortujla accompanies Odrade, Tamalane and the acolyte Suipol to meet the Great Honored Matre Dama on Junction, the old Spacing Guild complex above Gammu, as Miles Teg leads a force to attack Gammu. Dortujla and her party are eventually slain by the Honored Matres.\nNovels by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.\nSince 1999, Herbert's son Brian Herbert and author Kevin J. Anderson have published 15 prequel novels, collected in the series \"Prelude to Dune\" (1999\u20132001), \"Legends of Dune\" (2002\u20132004), \"Heroes of Dune\" (2008\u20132023), \"Great Schools of Dune\" (2012\u20132016), and \"The Caladan Trilogy\" (2020\u20132022). They have also released two sequel novels\u2014\"Hunters of Dune\" (2006) and \"Sandworms of Dune\" (2007)\u2014which complete the original series.\nIntroduced in \"Prelude to Dune\" (1999\u20132001).\nAnirul.\nAnirul is a Bene Gesserit of Hidden Rank, wife of the 81st Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV and the mother of his five daughters, the Princesses Irulan, Chalice, Wensicia, Josifa and Rugi. Anirul is referred to only three times in Herbert's 1965 novel \"Dune\", and only once by name, but is a major character in the \"Prelude to Dune\" prequel trilogy. In ' (1999), Anirul is described as having \"short bronze-brown hair,\" and that her \"features were long and narrow, giving her a doelike face, but her large eyes had a depth of millennia in them.\" In the novel, she is the Bene Gesserit Kwisatz Mother, the Reverend Mother chosen every generation to guide the Bene Gesserit breeding program. She calculates that the culmination of the program, the creation of a male superbeing called the Kwisatz Haderach, is imminent. This eventuality is contingent on a daughter of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen being bred with an Atreides male. The resulting daughter would then be bred with another Harkonnen heir, to produce the male Kwisatz Haderach. The Bene Gesserit Margot Fenring arranges for Anirul to marry Shaddam as a means for the Sisterhood to gain influence over the Imperial throne by ensuring that Shaddam will never have a son. During the events of ' (2001), Anirul is murdered by the Harkonnen Mentat Piter De Vries while trying to save the young Paul Atreides from being kidnapped.\nElrood IX.\nElrood IX of House Corrino is the Padishah Emperor, and father of Shaddam IV. He is mentioned twice in Appendix IV of \"Dune\", where it is noted that he \"succumbed to chaumurky\" (poison), rumored to have been administered by Count Hasimir Fenring. In \"Dune: House Atreides\", Elrood shows interest in Project Amal, an early attempt by the Bene Tleilax to create synthetic melange and eliminate dependence upon Arrakis. Success would guarantee Elrood total control over spice production. To further this goal, Elrood allows the Tleilaxu to invade and occupy the industrial planet Ix, with the help of Elrood's Sardaukar army, and remake it into a laboratory station for the project. Elrood's other motivation is revenge against Earl Dominic Vernius, the ruler of Ix, whose wife Shando had been one of Elrood's concublines. Shaddam is eager to become emperor, but despite Elrood's advanced age, he shows no signs of ill health. Shaddam finally tasks his longtime friend and minion Fenring to administer Elrood with an undetectable, slow-acting poison. Elrood finally dies, and Shaddam secures his throne by paying off the Spacing Guild with a supply of melange and by arranging his own marriage to a Bene Gesserit.\nIntroduced in \"Legends of Dune\" (2002\u20132004).\nSerena Butler.\nSerena Butler is a prominent politician and voice of the human rebellion who becomes the namesake of the Butlerian Jihad against the oppressive rule of the thinking machines in the \"Legends of Dune\" prequel trilogy. The daughter of League of Nobles Viceroy Manion Butler and his wife Livia, Serena is romantically involved with Xavier Harkonnen, who leads the military force on the League capital world of Salusa Secundus. The universe is under threat of total domination by the thinking machine empire, which consists of the evermind Omnius, the independent robot Erasmus and their army cymeks, fearsome weaponized machines controlled by disembodied human brains. The thinking machines control many worlds, and continue to conquer more, enslaving or exterminating any humans they encounter.\nIn \" (2002), Serena is captured by the thinking machines and studied by Erasmus, who seeks to understand humans completely so that the thinking machines can be truly superior. Though his methods of study often entail human vivisection and torture, Erasmus takes a liking to Serena, as does the young Vorian Atreides, a human trustee who serves the thinking machines. Serena realizes she is pregnant with Xavier's child, and later gives birth to a baby boy she names Manion. Eventually finding this distraction inconvenient, Erasmus not only removes Serena's uterus, but kills her young son in front of her and his slaves by dropping the child from a high balcony. This event, broadcast across the universe, incites a formal jihad against the thinking machines. Seeing Serena subsequently attack and destroy a sentinel robot with her bare hands encourages Erasmus' slaves, already groomed for rebellion by slave leader Iblis Ginjo, to rise up. Vorian, witnessing the murder and realizing the lie he lives as a machine trustee, flees with Serena and Ginjo.\nIn \" (2003), Ginjo (now Grand Patriarch of the Holy Jihad) and Serena (Priestess of the Jihad) have become the religious leaders of the human rebellion, now known the Butlerian Jihad, which elevates young Manion to a martyr. Serena is named interim Viceroy upon her father's retirement, but is later relegated to a figurehead by Ginjo as he consolidates his power. The humans begin to tire of war, but Serena and Ginjo know that true peace is not possible, and that the thinking machines must be destroyed. Serena visits Omnius as an emissary of the Jihad under the pretense of negotiating peace, but secretly intends to provoke Omnius into killing her, thereby making her a martyr and reenergizing the Jihad. Although Erasmus stops Omnius from murdering Serena, one of her Seraphim bodyguards, on orders from Ginjo, kills her instead. Ginjo manufactures images of Serena being tortured at length and murdered by the thinking machines, silencing anti-war dissenters and galvanizing the Jihad back into action.\nXavier Harkonnen.\nXavier Harkonnen is the courageous and honorable leader of the military force on the League of Nobles capital world of Salusa Secundus in the \"Legends of Dune\" prequel trilogy. In \"Dune: The Butlerian Jihad\", Xavier is romantically involved with Serena Butler until she is presumably killed in an attack by the thinking machines, who seek to conquer the universe and enslave or exterminate all humans. Xavier marries Serena's sister Octa and starts a family. Serena, actually a prisoner of the thinking machines, reappears after Manion, Serena and Xavier's infant son, is martyred by the independent robot Erasmus and sparks a jihad against the machines. In \"Dune: The Machine Crusade\", Serena and the formerly enslaved Iblis Ginjo have become the religious leaders of the human rebellion, with Xavier and Vorian Atreides its two generals. A hero of the Jihad, Xavier achieves many military victories over the machines. When he realizes the extent of Ginjo's corruption, Xavier sacrifices his own life and reputation by steering the ship carrying himself and Ginjo into a sun. His secrets dying with him, Ginjo becomes a martyred saint, and Xavier a traitor to humanity.\nVorian Atreides.\nVorian Atreides is the human son of the Titan Agamemnon, and later the founder of House Atreides, in the \"Legends of Dune\" trilogy. In \"Dune: The Butlerian Jihad\", he serves the thinking machines as a human trustee, his primary function being to deliver updates of the thinking machine ruler, the evermind Omnius, to machine-controlled worlds alongside his robot co-pilot, Seurat. Vorian falls in love with Serena Butler, a human captured by the independent robot Erasmus, and is horrified when Erasmus murders her child. Vorian betrays the thinking machines and flees with Serena and the human former slave leader Iblis Ginjo. In \"Dune: The Machine Crusade\", Serena and Ginjo have become the religious leaders of the human rebellion, with Vorian and Xavier Harkonnen as its two generals. A hero of the Jihad, Vorian achieves many military victories over the machines. Having become a close friend to Xavier, Vorian tries to clear Harkonnen's name after Xavier is branded a traitor for assassinating the corrupt Ginjo in a suicide flight into a sun. In \"\" (2004), Vorian commands the final assault on Omnius. Trapped on Corrin, the thinking machines have surrounded the planet with a human shield of slave ships, and Xavier's grandson Abulurd Harkonnen defies Vorian's orders to reactivate their weapons and attack. Abulurd is ultimately relieved of duty and charged with treason and cowardice, for which he is exiled, igniting the Atreides-Harkonnen feud which will last for millennia.\nHaving previously begun a family on Caladan which would become House Atreides, and fathering children on many worlds, Vorian is settled on the backwater world Kepler in \"Sisterhood of Dune\" (2012). His father Agamemnon's life-extension treatments have kept Vorian in his prime for generations, and he foils a group of slavers targeting his village. Vorian meets with Padishah Emperor Salvador Corrino, and is welcomed as a hero of the Jihad. The populace ask that he take the throne from the Corrinos, and though he declines to do so, Salvador and his brother Roderick worry that Vorian's presence may incite a revolution. In exchange for Vorian retreating into deeper exile, Salvador agrees to protect Kepler with Imperial forces. Vorian travels to Arrakis and is confronted by a vengeful Griffin Harkonnen, Abulurd's grandson, whose family ekes out a meager existence but hopes to improve its fortunes. Vorian and Griffin reconcile, but Griffin is later killed by the assassins Hyla and Andros, Vorian's twin half-siblings who are still loyal to the vanquished thinking machines. Vorian sends a message of condolence to Griffin's sister, Valya Harkonnen, who spurns the offer and plans her own revenge. In \"Mentats of Dune\" (2014), Vorian is wracked with guilt over Griffin's death, and tries to help his struggling family with a secret infusion of funds to their whaling business on Lankiveil. On Caladan, Vorian's descendant Orry Atreides is murdered on his wedding night by his new bride, who is secretly Tula Harkonnen, Griffin and Valya's younger sister. Vorian and Orry's brother, Willem, confront Valya and a remorseful Tula in \"Navigators of Dune\" (2016). Willem spares Tula's life when he learns that she is pregnant with Orry's child. Valya believes Vorian is dead when his ship explodes, but he survives.\nIblis Ginjo.\nIblis Ginjo is a human trustee, the enslaved head of a legion of other slaves, for the thinking machines in \"Dune: The Butlerian Jihad\". Initially loyal to machine leader Omnius and hoping to eventually secure his immortality by becoming a cymek, Ginjo is manipulated into fostering ideas of rebellion as part of a psychological experiment by the independent robot Erasmus. Ginjo begins to see the extent to which the thinking machines do not value human life, and when Erasmus murders the child of human captive Serena Butler, Ginjo spurs the slaves to revolt. He flees with Serena and fellow disillusioned trustee Vorian Atreides. In \"Dune: The Machine Crusade\", Ginjo (now Grand Patriarch of the Holy Jihad) and Serena (Priestess of the Jihad) have become the religious leaders of the human rebellion, now known as the Butlerian Jihad, with Vorian and Xavier Harkonnen as its two generals. Ginjo marries noblewoman Camie Boro, and fathers a daughter, Ticia Cenva with Zufa Cenva, the powerful leader of the telekinetic Sorceresses of Rossak. Serena is named interim Viceroy upon her father's retirement, but is later relegated to a figurehead by Ginjo as he consolidates his power.\nThe humans begin to tire of war, but Serena and Ginjo know that true peace is not possible, and that the thinking machines must be destroyed. Serena visits Omnius as an emissary of the Jihad under the pretense of negotiating peace, but secretly intends to provoke Omnius into killing her, thereby making her a martyr and reenergizing the Jihad. Although Erasmus stops Omnius from murdering Serena, one of her Seraphim bodyguards, on orders from Ginjo, kills her instead. Ginjo manufactures images of Serena being tortured at length and murdered by the thinking machines, silencing anti-war dissenters and galvanizing the Jihad back into action. As the war against the thinking machines continues, Ginjo becomes more and more corrupt, and focused more on his own power and legacy. He creates the Jipol (Jihad Police) to eliminate his political enemies, and orders organ raids on other League Worlds, casting blame on the thinking machines, to meet the demand for replacement human organs for injured Jihad troops. When Xavier realizes the extent of Ginjo's corruption, he sacrifices his own life and reputation by steering the ship carrying himself and Ginjo into a sun. His secrets dying with him, Ginjo becomes a martyred saint, and Xavier a traitor to humanity.\nNorma Cenva.\nNorma Cenva is the inventor of foldspace technology, first mentioned in \"God Emperor of Dune\". In the \"Legends of Dune\" trilogy, she is the daughter of Zufa Cenva, the powerful leader of the telekinetic Sorceresses of Rossak. Norma is short and unattractive as compared to her tall, beautiful mother, and though her lack of telekinetic abilities disappoints Zufa, Norma is a mathematical genius who is excited to assist the famed Tio Holtzman, discoverer of the Holtzman effect, which makes Holtzman shields possible. These force shields, capable of scrambling the gel-circuitry of thinking machines, are employed in \"Dune: The Butlerian Jihad\" to protect entire planets from invasion. However, the machines soon realize that their human-machine hybrid cymeks can slip through the field to destroy the transmitters because they possessed human brains which were unaffected by the scrambler fields. Norma then has the idea to use the field as an offensive weapon, projecting it with portable transmitters to knock out machines and their installations. During this time, she also uses the Holtzman effect to invent suspensors and glowglobes, for which Holtzman takes credit.\nIn \"Dune: The Machine Crusade\", Holtzman calculates that the field could be modified to prevent penetration from physical projectiles, and Norma agrees, correcting the flaws in his concept but noting that objects could still pass through the shield at a slow enough speed. She also predicts that when hit by a laser, the shield would react violently, resulting in an explosion with the same effect as a nuclear weapon. Norma next studies Holtzman's original field equations to find a way to fold space, soon inventing the theory of space-folding and building a prototype space-folding ship. She is sent away by Holtzman, who is threatened by her genius, shortly before he is killed by an explosive lasgun-shield interaction during a slave revolt. Norma's ship is then used to fold space successfully by Zensunni slaves fleeing the violent rebellion. \nNorma is captured and tortured by the Titan Xerxes in \"Dune: The Battle of Corrin\", which unleashes her latent psychic abilities. She destroys Xerxes and six cymeks, and then uses these powers to rework her own body into a more beautiful, appealing one based on the many women of her ancestry. The next year she and her mother's former lover, industrialist Aurelius Venport, establish a shipyard on Kolhar to produce space-folding ships, which will come to be known as heighliners. Ever uncaring about her own fame, Norma credits the invention to Aurelius as a gift to him. Aurelius puts the space-folding technology and shipyards at the disposal of the Jihad forces. Initially, navigation for foldspace travel is fundamentally inexact, and only about nine out of every ten heighliners arrive at their intended destination safety. Realizing that the spice melange amplifies her psychic and calculative abilities, Norma pioneers the use of massive concentrated doses to employ prescience to safely navigate foldspace. Aurelius and Norma's son, Adrien Venport, establishes the Foldspace Shipping Company, and finds the first ten volunteers to undergo, like Norma before them, the process to become Navigators. The Foldspace Shipping Company later becomes the Spacing Guild, monopolizing space commerce, transport, and interplanetary banking.\nIn the \"Great Schools of Dune\" trilogy, the highly evolved Norma periodically advises her great-grandson, Josef Venport, a ruthless businessman and the head of Venport Holdings. Her prescience allows her to envision long-term plans for her Navigators, and she manipulates Josef into evolving the company toward her goals. She is also able to fold space without a Holtzman drive. When Josef assassinates Emperor Salvador Corrino to protect his business interests, Norma intervenes to protect Josef from the wrath of Salvador's brother and successor, Roderick. She eventually negotiates with Roderick: Norma will leave Josef and his research facility unprotected against Roderick's avenging forces in exchange for sparing all current and future Navigators, the creation of an independent Spacing Guild and a guarantee that the flow of spice will continue. He agrees, but Norma saves Josef's life by beginning the process of making him a Navigator, exploiting the loophole she created in her deal with Roderick.\nNorma reappears as the Oracle of Time in the sequel novels \"Hunters of Dune\" and \"Sandworms of Dune\", which conclude the original series. She warns the Guild Navigators that the \"final battle\" is upon them, and they must locate the wandering no-ship \"Ithaca\", which is fleeing both the Bene Gesserit and the mysterious observers Daniel and Marty. The ship contains the ultimate Kwisatz Haderach, whom both sides in the great war between humanity and thinking machines want for their victory. Daniel and Marty are in fact reincarnations of thinking machine leaders Omnius and Erasmus, poised to finally conquer humanity and seize control of the universe. In \"Sandworms of Dune\", the Spacing Guild has begun replacing its Navigators with Ixian navigation devices at the prompting of Face Dancer infiltrators with their own plot to take over the universe. Their supply of melange cut off, the obsolete Navigators are dying one by one. As Navigator Edrik pursues alternate sources of the spice, he and the remaining Navigators seek the Oracle's assistance, but she is occupied with finding the \"Ithaca\". As the forces of humanity make a last stand against the thinking machine forces and the ultimate Kwisatz Haderach, Duncan Idaho, faces Omnius, the Oracle gathers the last of the Navigators. The weaponry and navigation of the human ships fail due to Face Dancer manipulations, but the Navigators intervene and are able to hold back the first wave of the machine attack. The Oracle emerges on the capital of the new Synchronized Empire, and takes all traces of Omnius with her to an alternate dimension. This paves the way for Duncan to bridge the gap between the humans and machines and guide the two into a peaceful coexistence.\nRaquella Berto-Anirul.\nRaquella Berto-Anirul is the founder of the Bene Gesserit, and the granddaughter of Vorian Atreides. In \"Dune: The Battle of Corrin\", Raquella and fellow doctor Mohandas Suk assist the Sorceresses of Rossak with a new outbreak of the plague deployed by the thinking machines to decimate humanity. After being infected herself, Raquella is miraculously cured by \"healing water\" found on the planet. Paranoid and fearing the doctor might somehow usurp her power as leader of the Sorceresses, Ticia Cenva poisons Raquella with the Rossak drug. Raquella's recovery has unlocked the genetic ability to render the poison harmless using her body chemistry, and she experiences the first iteration of what will ultimately be known as the spice agony. Raquella is awakened to her genetic memories, becoming the first Reverend Mother. Soon she also discovers the new ability to command others with Voice. Raquella conceives a daughter with Suk, but remains on Rossak to continue her work as he pursues his goal to form the greatest medical school ever seen (later known as the Suk School). Ticia dies, and Raquella assumes authority over the Sorceresses and their breeding programs, forming the Sisterhood.\nIn \"Sisterhood of Dune\", Raquella thwarts Butlerian sympathizers within her own ranks, including her own granddaughter, Dorotea. They correctly suspect that Raquella and her inner circle, including Valya Harkonnen, are using forbidden computers to manage their breeding index, which contains an immense amount of family data from across the Imperium. Dorotea takes the Rossak drug, and survives to become the second Reverend Mother. She learns of the secret computers and alerts Emperor Salvador Corrino, who invades Rossak. Raquella and Valya remove the computers in advance, but a petulant Salvador disbands the Sisterhood School on Rossak. Dorotea establishes an Orthodox Sisterhood sanctioned by Salvador, and Raquella and her followers find refuge on Wallach IX. Valya becomes the third Reverend Mother. In \"Mentats of Dune\", Raquella believes that the only hope for the Sisterhood to survive is for the Wallach IX sisters to reconcile with Dorotea's Orthodox faction. Her health failing, Raquella summons Dorotea and forces her and Valya to put their differences aside and agree to work together for the good of the Sisterhood. Naming them co-leaders, Raquella dies. Valya however, still bitter about Dorotea's betrayal, uses her newly discovered power of Voice to force Dorotea to commit suicide. Valya declares herself to be the sole Mother Superior, and ingratiates herself to the new Emperor, Salvador's brother Roderick.\nRaquella is portrayed by Cathy Tyson in the 2024 HBO television series \"\". As the founder and leader of the Sisterhood, she has created a network of influence by placing her Truthsayers, loyal to the Sisterhood, as trusted advisors to the Great Houses. Raquella has also initiated a secret breeding program intended to guide noble bloodlines to cultivate better, more easily controlled leaders. In \"\", a dying Raquella tells young Valya Harkonnen that she must grow, protect and strengthen the Sisterhood, and that Valya \"will be the one to see the burning truth, and know.\" Raquella's granddaughter Dorotea intends to destroy the breeding program as something heretical and impure, so Valya uses the Voice to force Dorotea to kill herself. Thirty years later, Valya is Mother Superior and has grown the Sisterhood in size and power, but her carefully orchestrated plans are thwarted by mysterious Imperial soldier Desmond Hart, who perceives the Sisterhood as a growing threat to the autonomy of the Imperium. Desmond uses a \"great power\" granted to him by his near-death experience on Arrakis to psychically immolate Imperial Truthsayer Kasha Jinjo, whose burned body reminds Valya of Raquella's dying prediction.\nIn \"\", Sister Lila is revealed to be Raquella's great-great-granddaughter. With the Sisterhood desperate for more information about the dangerous prophecy which is now unfolding, Lila undergoes the dangerous Agony ritual to unlock her Other Memory and access Raquella's consciousness. Raquella speaks through her, providing more details about the prophecy that point to Desmond as the key to a coming reckoning. \"Sisterhood Above All\" depicts Raquella meeting and taking Valya under her wing, eventually sharing with her the secret of the forbidden technology used to maintain her vast DNA database. Recognizing that her life is waning, Raquella intends to put Valya and Dorotea through the Agony to succeed her as leaders of the Sisterhood. Valya at first refuses, and Raquella issues the ultimatum that she take care of her family issues and return as a Reverend Mother, or not at all. Once Valya is sure that her brother Griffin's death has been avenged, she self-administers the Rossak drug and survives.\nIntroduced in \"Hunters of Dune\" (2006).\nDoria.\nDoria is an ambitious Honored Matre who reluctantly joins the Bene Gesserit as Murbella hopes to unite the opposing factions in \"Hunters of Dune\". Though Doria seeks to learn the impressive skills of the Bene Gesserit, her Honored Matre impulsiveness and resistance to authority are difficult to shake. A chief advisor to Murbella, Doria is one of the few assimilated Honored Matres with access to sensitive Bene Gesserit breeding records. Doria and Bellonda are on opposite sides from the beginning. Hoping to force them to at least respect each other's differences, Murbella makes them partners managing the spice operations on Chapterhouse. Years later, Doria kills Bellonda in a final confrontation. An outraged Murbella forces Doria to share minds with Bellonda, and makes her the sole Spice Operations Director. Six years later, driven to the brink of insanity by Bellonda's incessant chatter within her mind, Doria is devoured by a sandworm.\nHellica.\nHellica is the self-declared Matre Superior of the largest renegade Honored Matre force, based on the conquered planet Tleilax in the former capital Bandalong. In \"Hunters of Dune\", Hellica forces captive Lost Tleilaxu Uxtal to employ the secret of the Tleilaxu axlotl tanks to produce increased quantities of the orange spice substitute used by the Honored Matres. When Guild Navigator Edrik seeks Uxtal's knowledge of producing melange in the tanks, Hellica's price for his expertise is Edrik's help transporting a certain cargo. He agrees, delivering by heighliner the Obliterators that destroy the planet Richese, where the Bene Gesserit are mass-producing weapons and armed battleships. Later, Hellica attempts an Obliterator attack on Chapterhouse itself, but the plan fails. Murbella's forces conquer Tleilax, and Hellica is killed, but Murbella realizes that the Matre Superior and some of her elite guard had actually been Face Dancer duplicates.\nIntroduced in \"Great Schools of Dune\" (2012\u20132016).\nValya Harkonnen.\nValya Harkonnen and her brother Griffin are the newest generation of a once-mighty family who were brought to ruin, and exiled to the ice planet Lankiveil. Their ambition is to both reclaim their family's rightful place, and avenge themselves on the Atreides, who caused their downfall. In the \"Great Schools of Dune\" series, Valya plots to rise within, and ultimately take control of, the fledgling Bene Gesserit, while galvanizing her siblings to help her visit Harkonnen vengeance on the bloodline of Vorian Atreides.\nEmily Watson portrays Valya in the 2024 HBO series \"\", and Jessica Barden plays a younger version of the character in flashbacks.\nGriffin Harkonnen.\nGriffin Harkonnen is a young nobleman hoping to restore his family's fortunes through service to the Landsraad. In \"Sisterhood of Dune\" (2012), his sister Valya learns that the man to blame for the downfall of the Harkonnens decades before, Vorian Atreides, has been made seemingly immortal by the thinking machines and is still alive. Bent on revenge, Griffin tracks Vorian to the desert planet Arrakis. Vorian saves Griffin from a giant sandworm, and Griffin subsequently defeats Vorian in a duel, but spares his life. Though they come to an understanding to end the Atreides-Harkonnen feud, Griffin is executed by Vorian's sister Hyla, an assassin loyal to the vanquished thinking machines. Vorian returns Griffin's body to Lankiveil with a letter of condolence, and Valya refuses to believe he did not kill her brother himself.\nEarl Cave portrays Griffin in the 2024 HBO series \"Dune: Prophecy\". In the episode \"Sisterhood Above All\", Griffin shares Valya's desire to regain their family's status, and seeks to advance in the Landsraad. He is later killed, and though Valya curses that he was murdered by Vorian Atreides, the elder Harkonnens blame Valya.\nDorotea.\nDorotea is Valya Harkonnen's nemesis and the leader of an anti-technology faction within the Sisterhood. In \"Sisterhood of Dune\", Valya is a trusted aide to Mother Superior Raquella Berto-Anirul, who has shared with Valya the secret that she has flouted the Butlerian prohibitions on thinking machines by using computers to maintain the extensive records of the Sisterhood's breeding program. Dorotea, a Butlerian sympathizer and Raquella's granddaughter, discovers the existence of the computers and reports it to Emperor Salvador Corrino. Valya helps Raquella remove them in advance of the Emperor's invasion, but a petulant Salvador disbands the Sisterhood School on Rossak. Dorotea returns to the capital world of Salusa Secundus with the Emperor as his Truthsayer, and forms an orthodox faction of sisters. In \"Mentats of Dune\" (2014), Valya retrieves the hidden computers from Rossak and hopes to succeed Raquella as Mother Superior. Nearing the end of her life, Raquella believes that the only hope for the Sisterhood to survive is for the Wallach IX sisters to reconcile with Dorotea's faction. She forces Valya and Dorotea to put their differences aside and agree to work together for the good of the Sisterhood. Naming them co-leaders, Raquella dies. Valya however, still bitter about Dorotea's betrayal, has recently mastered the Voice, and uses it to force Dorotea to commit suicide. \nDorotea is portrayed by Camilla Beeput in the 2024 HBO television series \"Dune: Prophecy\". She is young Valya Harkonnen's rival in the Sisterhood, and the granddaughter and heir apparent of Mother Superior Raquella. Dorotea is described as \"pious and determined to return the Sisterhood to what she believes are its core values.\" In \"\", Dorotea and Valya are at a dying Raquella's bedside to hear her final words, urging them to \"use every tool\" to grow, protect and strengthen the Sisterhood after her death. Valya urges the gathered Sisters to carry on Raquella's legacy by expanding their reach and influence, and by pushing the boundaries of their abilities. Dorotea, however, preaches humility, and indirect power. Raquella has devised a secret breeding program, intended to guide noble bloodlines to cultivate better, more easily controlled leaders. With Raquella dead, Dorotea rushes to destroy it, believing it to be sinful. Valya uses the Voice to stop her, and when Dorotea refuses to bend to Valya's will, she commands Dorotea to commit suicide.\nIn \"\", Sister Lila is revealed to be Dorotea's granddaughter. With the Sisterhood desperate for more information about the dangerous prophecy which is now unfolding, Lila undergoes the dangerous Agony ritual to unlock her Other Memory and access Raquella's consciousness. Raquella speaks through her, but then the vengeful persona of Dorotea overwhelms Lila, who appears to die. \"Sisterhood Above All\" depicts Dorotea looking on as Raquella meets and takes Valya under her wing. Recognizing that her life is waning, Raquella intends to put Valya and Dorotea through the Agony to succeed her as leaders of the Sisterhood. Valya at first refuses, while Dorotea accepts and survives the ordeal.\nTula Harkonnen.\nTula Harkonnen is the youngest Harkonnen sibling, and has been groomed to share Valya and Griffin's hatred for the Atreides, and desire for revenge against them. In \"Mentats of Dune\", she has joined the Sisterhood, and dutifully follows Valya's instructions to marry young Orry Atreides, and murder him on their wedding night. Tula is overcome with guilt over Orry in \"Navigators of Dune\" (2016), and Orry's vengeful brother, Willem Atreides, spares her life when she reveals that she is pregnant with Orry's child.\nOlivia Williams portrays Tula in the 2024 HBO series \"Dune: Prophecy\", and Emma Canning plays a younger version of the character in flashbacks."}
{"id": "7901", "revid": "1808194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7901", "title": "Vladimir Harkonnen", "text": "Baron Vladimir Harkonnen () is a fictional character in the \"Dune\" franchise created by Frank Herbert. He is primarily featured in the 1965 novel \"Dune\" and is also a prominent character in the \"Prelude to Dune\" prequel trilogy (1999\u20132001) by Herbert's son Brian and Kevin J. Anderson. The character is brought back as a ghola in the Herbert/Anderson sequels which conclude the original series, \"Hunters of Dune\" (2006) and \"Sandworms of Dune\" (2007).\nBaron Harkonnen is portrayed by Kenneth McMillan in David Lynch's 1984 film \"Dune\". Ian McNeice plays the role in the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries \"Frank Herbert's Dune\" and its sequel, 2003's \"Children of Dune\". Harkonnen is portrayed by Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd in the 2021 Denis Villeneuve film \"Dune\" and its 2024 sequel \"\".\nConception.\nFrank Herbert wanted a harsh-sounding name for the antagonistic family opposing House Atreides in \"Dune\". He came across the name \"H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen\" in a California telephone book and thought that it sounded \"Soviet\", though it is in fact Finnish. In earlier drafts of \"Dune\", the character was called \"Valdemar Hoskanner\".\nDescription.\nHerbert's \"Appendix IV: The Almanak en-Ashraf (Selected Excerpts of the Noble Houses)\" in \"Dune\" says of Harkonnen (in part):\nThe character is usually described as the main antagonist of the novel. Herbert writes in \"Dune\" that the Baron possesses a \"basso voice\" and is so \"grossly and immensely fat\" that he requires anti-gravity devices known as suspensors to support his weight. He is one of the wealthiest members of the Landsraad and a bitter rival of Leto Atreides, and the Baron's \"legendary evil and intellect\" are unmatched by anyone else from House Harkonnen. In the novel, the Baron feigns outrage over losing control of Arrakis to Leto, but is actually conspiring to use the situation as an opportunity to destroy House Atreides once and for all. \nWilliam Hughes of \"The A.V. Club\" describes the Baron as \"a decadent, monstrous gasbag of depravity and evil\". As ruthless and cruel as he is intelligent and cunning, the Baron is \"crafty and power-hungry\" and has a talent for manipulating others and exploiting their weaknesses as well as a propensity for torture and blackmail. \"IGN\" describes the character as \"cruel, sadistic, and hedonistic\". Travis Johnson of Flicks.com.au says that Harkonnen is written as \"a predatory homosexual given to pederasty and incest, an unrepentant rapist and murderer.\" The Baron's sexual preference for young men is implied in \"Dune\" and \"Children of Dune\". It is noted, however, that he \"once permitted himself to be seduced\" by a Bene Gesserit in the liaison which produced his secret daughter.\nPlotlines.\n\"Dune\".\nAs \"Dune\" begins, a longstanding feud exists between the Harkonnens of Giedi Prime and the Atreides of Caladan. The Baron's intent to exterminate the Atreides line seems close to fruition, as Duke Leto Atreides is lured to the desert planet Arrakis on the pretense of taking over the valuable melange operation there. The Baron has an agent in the Atreides household: Leto's own physician, the trusted Suk doctor Wellington Yueh. Though Suk Imperial Conditioning supposedly makes the subject incapable of inflicting harm, the Baron's twisted Mentat Piter De Vries has managed to break it using the threat of interminable torture on Yueh's captive wife Wanna. \nHarkonnen also distracts Leto's Mentat Thufir Hawat from discovering Yueh by guiding Hawat toward another suspect: Leto's Bene Gesserit concubine Lady Jessica, of whom Hawat is already distrustful. The Atreides are soon attacked by Harkonnen forces, secretly supplemented by the seemingly unstoppable Imperial Sardaukar, as Yueh disables the protective shields around the Atreides palace on Arrakis. Yueh takes Leto prisoner as instructed, but provides him with a fake tooth filled with poisonous gas as a means to assassinate the Baron. De Vries kills Yueh, Leto and De Vries die from the gas, but Harkonnen survives. The Baron then manipulates Hawat into his service, by convincing Hawat that Jessica was the traitor and using Hawat's desire for revenge on her and the Emperor as motivation to assist House Harkonnen.\nJessica flees into the desert with her and Leto's son Paul Atreides, and both are presumed dead. Paul's prescience helps him determine the identity of Jessica's father, the \"maternal grandfather who cannot be named\"\u2014the Baron himself. Over the next two years, Harkonnen learns that his nephews Glossu Rabban and Feyd-Rautha are conspiring against him to usurp his throne. He lets them continue to do so, reasoning that they have to somehow learn to organize a conspiracy. As punishment for a failed assassination attempt against him, Harkonnen forces Feyd to single-handedly slaughter all the female slaves who serve as Feyd's lovers. He explains that Feyd has to learn the price of failure.\nThe Baron's plan to assure Feyd's power is to install him as ruler of Arrakis after a period of tyrannical misrule by Rabban, making Feyd appear to be the savior of the people. However, a crisis on Arrakis begins when the mysterious Muad'Dib emerges as a leader of the native Fremen tribes, uniting them against the rule of the Harkonnens. Eventually, a series of Fremen victories against Beast Rabban threaten to disrupt the trade of the spice, inciting the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV to intervene personally, leading several legions of Sardaukar. After the emperor's arrival on Arrakis, both Corrino and Harkonnen are shocked to learn that rather than a native Fremen warlord, their opponent Muad'Dib is the still-living Paul Atreides, and the Emperor's intervention was part of his plan. \nThe Imperial forces fall prey to a surprise attack by the Fremen, who let a sandstorm short out the force field shields of the transport ships, and then disable them with projectile weapons, subsequently mounting a mass assault using sandworms as siege-breakers. Their enemies are left trapped on the planet, outnumbered by the many tribes and outgunned by the sandworms. The Harkonnens' past ruthlessness further causes the enraged Fremen to give them little to no quarter. Over the course of the battle their entire army is exterminated.\nThe Harkonnen leadership are also all killed in the course of this battle. Rabban dies first, in the early stages of the battle. Baron Harkonnen himself is poisoned with a gom jabbar by Paul's sister Alia Atreides, a two-year-old born as a fully aware Fremen Reverend Mother, who reveals that she is his granddaughter to him just before his death. His remaining heir Feyd-Rautha is killed in ritual combat by Paul Atreides. House Harkonnen as a political entity is left virtually defunct - permanently excluded from galactic power - though Harkonnen \"blood\" is technically ascendant since Imperial House Atreides is composed entirely of Vladimir Harkonnen's descendants.\n\"Children of Dune\".\nAlia had been born with her ancestral memories in the womb, a circumstance the Bene Gesserit refer to as Abomination, because in their experience it is inevitable that the individual will become possessed by the personality of one of their ancestors. In \"Children of Dune\", Alia falls victim to this prediction when she shares control of her body with the ego-memory of the Baron Harkonnen, and eventually falls under his power. Alia eventually commits suicide, realizing that Harkonnen's consciousness has surpassed her abilities to contain him.\n\"Prelude to Dune\".\nIn the \"Prelude to Dune\" prequel series by Brian Herbert and Anderson, it is established that Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is the son and heir of Dmitri Harkonnen and his wife Victoria. Harkonnen's father had been the head of House Harkonnen and ruled the planet Giedi Prime. Trained since youth as a possible successor, Vladimir had been eventually chosen over his half-brother Abulurd, namesake of the original. Unhappy with his brother's doings, Abulurd eventually marries Emmi Rabban and renounces the family name and his rights to the title. \nUnder the name Abulurd Rabban, he reigns as governor of the secondary Harkonnen planet Lankiveil. Abulurd and his wife have two sons: Glossu Rabban, later nicknamed \"Beast Rabban\" after he murders his own father, and Feyd-Rautha. Vladimir later adopts the boys back into House Harkonnen, and Feyd becomes his designated heir. The Baron's most prominent political rival is Duke Leto Atreides. The Harkonnens and the Atreides have been bitter enemies for millennia, since the Battle of Corrin that ended the Butlerian Jihad. When Emperor Shaddam IV orchestrates a plot to destroy the \"Red Duke\" Leto, the Baron eagerly lends his aid.\nThe young Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is described as an exceedingly handsome man, possessing red hair and a near-perfect physique. The Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam is instructed by the Sisterhood to collect his genetic material, through conception, for their breeding program. As the Baron's homosexuality is something of an open secret, Mohiam blackmails him into having sexual relations with her, and conceives his child. When that daughter proves genetically undesirable, Mohiam kills her and returns to Harkonnen for a second try. At this point, he drugs and rapes her. She exacts her retribution by infecting him with a rare, incurable disease that later causes his obesity. Mohiam's second child with the Baron is Jessica. \nIn ', the deteriorating Baron at first walks with the assistance of a cane, then relies on belt-mounted suspensors to retain mobility. He consults numerous doctors in the expanse of time between the ' and \"Dune: House Harkonnen\", up to and including his future instrument Dr. Yueh, all of whom are ultimately no help. To conceal this debilitation, he pretends that his obesity is due to intentional overindulgence, lest the Landsraad remove him from power. When he determines that Mohiam inflicted him with the disease, he attempts to coerce her into revealing the cure, but soon discovers that there is none. The Baron, Duke Leto, and Jessica are unaware that Jessica is secretly the Baron's daughter, or that he has even fathered one. In the year 10,176, the Baron's grandson Paul is born to Leto and Jessica.\n\"Hunters of Dune\".\nIn \"Hunters of Dune\" (2006), the continuation of the original series by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, the Baron is resurrected as a ghola (5,029 years after the death of Alia) by the Lost Tleilaxu Uxtal, acting on orders from the Face Dancer Khrone. Khrone intends to use the Baron ghola to manipulate a ghola of Paul Atreides, named Paolo. Khrone tries various torture techniques for three years to awaken the 12-year-old Baron's genetic memories; these methods fail due to the Baron's sadomasochistic nature. Khrone is successful when he imprisons the Baron in a sensory deprivation tank for a prolonged period; the Baron's memories of his former life return. The reincarnated Baron is soon haunted by the voice of Alia in his mind; the source of this inner Alia is never explained.\nIn adaptations.\nCancelled 1970s film.\nIn 1975, Orson Welles agreed to play the Baron in Alejandro Jodorowsky's ultimately unsuccessful adaptation. The film's concept art by Jean \"Moebius\" Giraud depicts the Baron, as well as Feyd-Rautha and Rabban, in multiple drag appearances. In the documentary Jodorowsky's Dune, the director discussed the casting:\n1984 film.\nBaron Harkonnen is portrayed by Kenneth McMillan in David Lynch's 1984 film. The obese and disheveled Baron is overtly unstable, and covered in oozing pustules. William Hughes of \"The A.V. Club\" deemed McMillan's facial prosthetics \"very memorable\". Emmet Asher-Perrin of \"Tor.com\" wrote that \"Lynch's attempt is infamous for really leaning on [the] codified aspects of the Baron, to the point where his sore-ridden appearance has been called out as a likely connection to the AIDS epidemic, which was a prevalent health crisis while the film was in production.\" Travis Johnson of Flicks.com.au noted that the Lynch film embraced \"the archetype of the depraved gay sadist\", which would not be acceptable in 2019. Asher-Perrin added, \"Lynch also makes a point of connecting the Baron's desire for men to deviancy and violence, deliberately juxtaposing his assault of a young man with a tender love-scene between Duke Leto and Lady Jessica Atreides.\"\n2000 miniseries.\nIan McNeice plays the Baron in the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries \"Frank Herbert's Dune\", and its sequel, 2003's \"Children of Dune\". Asher-Perrin notes that the miniseries played down the negative aspects emphasized by the Lynch film, and writes, \"[The Baron's] appearance was not altered to make him seem ill, he never physically attacks anyone, and the miniseries paid more attention to the fact that the Baron was a rapist, his preference for men being incidental.\" He praises McNeice as a standout among the cast, writing that he \"manages to make the Baron Harkonnen\u2014easily one of the most despicable characters in science fiction literature\u2014every bit as conniving and vicious as he needs to be...and every bit as fascinating. McNeice has a superb sense of how to make the baron mesmerizing to watch no matter how odiously he behaves\". Austin Jones of \"Paste\" writes, \"McNeice commands his role as Baron Harkonnen, capturing the vile indulgence and vanity of a feudal lord\".\n2021 and 2024 films.\nBaron Harkonnen is portrayed by Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd in the 2021 Denis Villeneuve film \"Dune\" and its 2024 sequel \"\". Skarsg\u00e5rd called the role \"small but important\", and noted, \"I had seven hours in make-up every day because I had to be really fat.\" Villeneuve said:\nMerchandising and influence.\nA line of \"Dune\" action figures from toy company LJN was released to lackluster sales in 1984. Styled after David Lynch's film, the collection featured a figure of Baron Harkonnen, as well as other characters. In 2006, SOTA Toys produced a Baron Harkonnen action figure for their \"Now Playing Presents\" line.\nH. R. Giger's Harkonnen Chair is a chair originally designed by the artist as set dressing for an unrealized 1970s adaptation of \"Dune\" by Alejandro Jodorowsky.\nAnalysis.\nThomas West of \"Screen Rant\" writes that \"there are few science fiction villains quite as compelling and darkly charismatic as the Baron\". William Hughes of \"The A.V. Club\" calls the Baron \"one of the most iconically awful villains in all of science fiction\". Stuart Conover of ScienceFiction.com describes him as \"one of the most insidious villains\". Maude Campbell of \"Popular Mechanics\" writes that the Baron is \"one of the most evil characters ever put to paper (including Darth Vader)\", and Jon Michaud of \"The New Yorker\" compares \"Herbert's scheming, backstabbing villain, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen\" to the villainous Lannister family of George R. R. Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series. \nEmmet Asher-Perrin suggests that \"what makes the Baron truly monstrous [is] the fact that he spends all of his time plotting murder, sowing discord, and destroying populations of people to get his way\". Hughes writes that the evil Harkonnen is \"specifically designed to make the noble Atreides family seem that extra bit more dignified and pure\". Jesse Schedeen of \"IGN\" agrees that the Baron is \"as cruel and vindictive as Leto is noble and just.\" Hughes says that Herbert \"successfully made [the Baron] so vampirically vile that he casts a (sometimes literal) shadow over the entire series.\" Sandy Schaefer of \"Screen Rant\" calls the Baron \"a deliciously despicable antagonist\".\nWhile the novel suggests that the Baron's obesity might be the result of a genetic disease, the \"Prelude to Dune\" prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson explains that Harkonnen was once a fit, attractive but vain man who is given the incurable disease intentionally by the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Mohiam after he drugs and rapes her. Asher-Perrin suggests that in this narrative, \"The Baron's corpulence is meant to be comeuppance for doing something reprehensible, a physical punishment meant to hurt his vanity by taking away the attractiveness he so prized in himself.\""}

DH is one of the earliest practical examples of public key exchange implemented within the field of cryptography. Published in 1976 by Diffie and Hellman, this is the earliest publicly known work that proposed the idea of a private key and a corresponding public key.\nTraditionally, secure encrypted communication between two parties required that they first exchange keys by some secure physical means, such as paper key lists transported by a trusted courier. The Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange method allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel. This key can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric-key cipher.\nDiffie\u2013Hellman is used to secure a variety of Internet services. However, research published in October 2015 suggests that the parameters in use for many DH Internet applications at that time are not strong enough to prevent compromise by very well-funded attackers, such as the security services of some countries.\nThe scheme was published by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976, but in 1997 it was revealed that James H. Ellis, Clifford Cocks, and Malcolm J. Williamson of GCHQ, the British signals intelligence agency, had previously shown in 1969 how public-key cryptography could be achieved.\nAlthough Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange itself is a non-authenticated key-agreement protocol, it provides the basis for a variety of authenticated protocols, and is used to provide forward secrecy in Transport Layer Security's ephemeral modes (referred to as EDH or DHE depending on the cipher suite).\nThe method was followed shortly afterwards by RSA, an implementation of public-key cryptography using asymmetric algorithms.\nExpired US patent 4200770 from 1977 describes the now public-domain algorithm. It credits Hellman, Diffie, and Merkle as inventors.\nName.\nIn 2006, Hellman suggested the algorithm be called Diffie\u2013Hellman\u2013Merkle key exchange in recognition of Ralph Merkle's contribution to the invention of public-key cryptography (Hellman, 2006), writing:\nDescription.\nGeneral overview.\nDiffie\u2013Hellman key exchange establishes a shared secret between two parties that can be used for secret communication for exchanging data over a public network. An analogy illustrates the concept of public key exchange by using colors instead of very large numbers:\nThe process begins by having the two parties, Alice and Bob, publicly agree on an arbitrary starting color that does not need to be kept secret. In this example, the color is yellow. Each person also selects a secret color that they keep to themselves \u2013 in this case, red and cyan. The crucial part of the process is that Alice and Bob each mix their own secret color together with their mutually shared color, resulting in orange-tan and light-blue mixtures respectively, and then publicly exchange the two mixed colors. Finally, each of them mixes the color they received from the partner with their own private color. The result is a final color mixture (yellow-brown in this case) that is identical to their partner's final color mixture.\nIf a third party listened to the exchange, they would only know the common color (yellow) and the first mixed colors (orange-tan and light-blue), but it would be very hard for them to find out the final secret color (yellow-brown). Bringing the analogy back to a real-life exchange using large numbers rather than colors, this determination is computationally expensive. It is impossible to compute in a practical amount of time even for modern supercomputers.\nCryptographic explanation.\nThe simplest and the original implementation, later formalized as Finite Field Diffie\u2013Hellman in RFC 7919, of the protocol uses the multiplicative group of integers modulo \"p\", where \"p\" is prime, and \"g\" is a primitive root modulo \"p\". To guard against potential vulnerabilities, it is recommended to use prime numbers of at least 2048 bits in length. This increases the difficulty for an adversary attempting to compute the discrete logarithm and compromise the shared secret. These two values are chosen in this way to ensure that the resulting shared secret can take on any value from 1 to . Here is an example of the protocol, with non-secret values in , and secret values in .\nBoth Alice and Bob have arrived at the same values because under mod \"p\",\nMore specifically,\nOnly \"a\" and \"b\" are kept secret. All the other values \u2013 \"p\", \"g\", \"ga\" mod \"p\", and \"gb\" mod \"p\" \u2013 are sent in the clear. The strength of the scheme comes from the fact that \"gab\" mod \"p\" = \"gba\" mod \"p\" take extremely long times to compute by any known algorithm just from the knowledge of \"p\", \"g\", \"ga\" mod \"p\", and \"gb\" mod \"p\". Such a function that is easy to compute but hard to invert is called a one-way function. Once Alice and Bob compute the shared secret they can use it as an encryption key, known only to them, for sending messages across the same open communications channel.\nOf course, much larger values of \"a\", \"b\", and \"p\" would be needed to make this example secure, since there are only 23 possible results of \"n\" mod 23. However, if \"p\" is a prime of at least 600 digits, then even the fastest modern computers using the fastest known algorithm cannot find \"a\" given only \"g\", \"p\" and \"ga\" mod \"p\". Such a problem is called the discrete logarithm problem. The computation of \"ga\" mod \"p\" is known as modular exponentiation and can be done efficiently even for large numbers.\nNote that \"g\" need not be large at all, and in practice is usually a small integer (like 2, 3, ...).\nSecrecy chart.\nThe chart below depicts who knows what, again with non-secret values in , and secret values in . Here Eve is an eavesdropper \u2013 she watches what is sent between Alice and Bob, but she does not alter the contents of their communications.\nNow s is the shared secret key and it is known to both Alice and Bob, but \"not\" to Eve. Note that it is not helpful for Eve to compute \"AB\", which equals \"g\"a+b mod p.\nNote: It should be difficult for Alice to solve for Bob's private key or for Bob to solve for Alice's private key. If it is not difficult for Alice to solve for Bob's private key (or vice versa), then an eavesdropper, Eve, may simply substitute her own private / public key pair, plug Bob's public key into her private key, produce a fake shared secret key, and solve for Bob's private key (and use that to solve for the shared secret key). Eve may attempt to choose a public / private key pair that will make it easy for her to solve for Bob's private key.\nGeneralization to finite cyclic groups.\nHere is a more general description of the protocol:\nBoth Alice and Bob are now in possession of the group element \"gab\" = \"gba\", which can serve as the shared secret key. The group \"G\" satisfies the requisite condition for secure communication as long as there is no efficient algorithm for determining \"gab\" given \"g\", \"ga\", and \"gb\".\nFor example, the elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman protocol is a variant that represents an element of G as a point on an elliptic curve instead of as an integer modulo n.\u00a0Variants using hyperelliptic curves have also been proposed. The supersingular isogeny key exchange is a Diffie\u2013Hellman variant that was designed to be secure against quantum computers, but it was broken in July 2022.\nEphemeral and/or static keys.\nThe used keys can either be ephemeral or static (long term) key, but could even be mixed, so called semi-static DH. These variants have different properties and hence different use cases. An overview over many variants and some also discussions can for example be found in NIST SP 800-56A. A basic list:\nIt is possible to use ephemeral and static keys in one key agreement to provide more security as for example shown in NIST SP 800-56A, but it is also possible to combine those in a single DH key exchange, which is then called triple DH (3-DH).\nTriple Diffie\u2013Hellman (3-DH).\nIn 1997 a kind of triple DH was proposed by Simon Blake-Wilson, Don Johnson, Alfred Menezes in 1997, which was improved by C. Kudla and K. G. Paterson in 2005 and shown to be secure.\nThe long term secret keys of Alice and Bob are denoted by \"a\" and \"b\" respectively, with public keys \"A\" and \"B\", as well as the ephemeral key pairs (\"x\", \"X\") and (\"y\", \"Y\"). Then protocol is:\nThe long term public keys need to be transferred somehow. That can be done beforehand in a separate, trusted channel, or the public keys can be encrypted using some partial key agreement to preserve anonymity. For more of such details as well as other improvements like side channel protection or explicit key confirmation, as well as early messages and additional password authentication, see e.g. US patent \"Advanced modular handshake for key agreement and optional authentication\".\nExtended Triple Diffie\u2013Hellman (X3DH).\nX3DH was initially proposed as part of the Double Ratchet Algorithm used in the Signal Protocol. The protocol offers forward secrecy and cryptographic deniability. It operates on an elliptic curve.\nThe protocol uses five public keys. Alice has an identity key IKA and an ephemeral key EKA. Bob has an identity key IKB, a signed prekey SPKB, and a one-time prekey OPKB. Bob first publishes his three keys to a server, which Alice downloads and verifies the signature on. Alice then initiates the exchange to Bob. The OPK is optional.\nOperation with more than two parties.\nDiffie\u2013Hellman key agreement is not limited to negotiating a key shared by only two participants. Any number of users can take part in an agreement by performing iterations of the agreement protocol and exchanging intermediate data (which does not itself need to be kept secret). For example, Alice, Bob, and Carol could participate in a Diffie\u2013Hellman agreement as follows, with all operations taken to be modulo \"p\":\nAn eavesdropper has been able to see , , , , , and , but cannot use any combination of these to efficiently reproduce .\nTo extend this mechanism to larger groups, two basic principles must be followed:\nThese principles leave open various options for choosing in which order participants contribute to keys. The simplest and most obvious solution is to arrange the \"N\" participants in a circle and have \"N\" keys rotate around the circle, until eventually every key has been contributed to by all \"N\" participants (ending with its owner) and each participant has contributed to \"N\" keys (ending with their own). However, this requires that every participant perform \"N\" modular exponentiations.\nBy choosing a more desirable order, and relying on the fact that keys can be duplicated, it is possible to reduce the number of modular exponentiations performed by each participant to using a divide-and-conquer-style approach, given here for eight participants:\nOnce this operation has been completed all participants will possess the secret , but each participant will have performed only four modular exponentiations, rather than the eight implied by a simple circular arrangement.\nSecurity and practical considerations.\nThe protocol is considered secure against eavesdroppers if \"G\" and \"g\" are chosen properly. In particular, the order of the group G must be large, particularly if the same group is used for large amounts of traffic. The eavesdropper has to solve the Diffie\u2013Hellman problem to obtain \"g\"\"ab\". This is currently considered difficult for groups whose order is large enough. An efficient algorithm to solve the discrete logarithm problem would make it easy to compute \"a\" or \"b\" and solve the Diffie\u2013Hellman problem, making this and many other public key cryptosystems insecure. Fields of small characteristic may be less secure.\nThe order of \"G\" should have a large prime factor to prevent use of the Pohlig\u2013Hellman algorithm to obtain \"a\" or \"b\". For this reason, a Sophie Germain prime \"q\" is sometimes used to calculate , called a safe prime, since the order of \"G\" is then only divisible by 2 and \"q\". Sometimes \"g\" is chosen to generate the order \"q\" subgroup of \"G\", rather than \"G\", so that the Legendre symbol of \"ga\" never reveals the low order bit of \"a\". A protocol using such a choice is for example IKEv2.\nThe generator \"g\" is often a small integer such as 2. Because of the random self-reducibility of the discrete logarithm problem a small \"g\" is equally secure as any other generator of the same group.\nIf Alice and Bob use random number generators whose outputs are not completely random and can be predicted to some extent, then it is much easier to eavesdrop.\nIn the original description, the Diffie\u2013Hellman exchange by itself does not provide authentication of the communicating parties and can be vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.\nMallory (an active attacker executing the man-in-the-middle attack) may establish two distinct key exchanges, one with Alice and the other with Bob, effectively masquerading as Alice to Bob, and vice versa, allowing her to decrypt, then re-encrypt, the messages passed between them. Note that Mallory must be in the middle from the beginning and continuing to be so, actively decrypting and re-encrypting messages every time Alice and Bob communicate. If she arrives after the keys have been generated and the encrypted conversation between Alice and Bob has already begun, the attack cannot succeed. If she is ever absent, her previous presence is then revealed to Alice and Bob. They will know that all of their private conversations had been intercepted and decoded by someone in the channel. In most cases it will not help them get Mallory's private key, even if she used the same key for both exchanges.\nA method to authenticate the communicating parties to each other is generally needed to prevent this type of attack. Variants of Diffie\u2013Hellman, such as STS protocol, may be used instead to avoid these types of attacks.\nDenial-of-service attack.\nA CVE released in 2021 (\"CVE-2002-20001\") disclosed a denial-of-service attack (DoS) against the protocol variants use ephemeral keys, called D(HE)at attack. The attack exploits that the Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange allows attackers to send arbitrary numbers that are actually not public keys, triggering expensive modular exponentiation calculations on the victim's side. Another CVEs released disclosed that the Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange implementations may use long private exponents (\"CVE-2022-40735\") that arguably make modular exponentiation calculations unnecessarily expensive or may unnecessary check peer's public key (\"CVE-2024-41996\") has similar resource requirement as key calculation using a long exponent. An attacker can exploit both vulnerabilities together.\nPractical attacks on Internet traffic.\nThe number field sieve algorithm, which is generally the most effective in solving the discrete logarithm problem, consists of four computational steps. The first three steps only depend on the order of the group G, not on the specific number whose finite log is desired. It turns out that much Internet traffic uses one of a handful of groups that are of order 1024\u00a0bits or less. By precomputing the first three steps of the number field sieve for the most common groups, an attacker need only carry out the last step, which is much less computationally expensive than the first three steps, to obtain a specific logarithm. The Logjam attack used this vulnerability to compromise a variety of Internet services that allowed the use of groups whose order was a 512-bit prime number, so called export grade. The authors needed several thousand CPU cores for a week to precompute data for a single 512-bit prime. Once that was done, individual logarithms could be solved in about a minute using two 18-core Intel Xeon CPUs.\nAs estimated by the authors behind the Logjam attack, the much more difficult precomputation needed to solve the discrete log problem for a 1024-bit prime would cost on the order of $100 million, well within the budget of a large national intelligence agency such as the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The Logjam authors speculate that precomputation against widely reused 1024-bit DH primes is behind claims in leaked NSA documents that NSA is able to break much of current cryptography.\nTo avoid these vulnerabilities, the Logjam authors recommend use of elliptic curve cryptography, for which no similar attack is known. Failing that, they recommend that the order, \"p\", of the Diffie\u2013Hellman group should be at least 2048\u00a0bits. They estimate that the pre-computation required for a 2048-bit prime is 109 times more difficult than for 1024-bit primes.\nSecurity against quantum computers.\nQuantum computers can break public-key cryptographic schemes, such as RSA, finite-field DH and elliptic-curve DH key-exchange protocols, using Shor's algorithm for solving the factoring problem, the discrete logarithm problem, and the period-finding problem. A post-quantum variant of Diffie-Hellman algorithm was proposed in 2023, and relies on a combination of the quantum-resistant CRYSTALS-Kyber protocol, as well as the old elliptic curve X25519 protocol. A quantum Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol that relies on a quantum one-way function, and its security relies on fundamental principles of quantum mechanics has also been proposed in the literature. \nOther uses.\nEncryption.\nPublic key encryption schemes based on the Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange have been proposed. The first such scheme is the ElGamal encryption. A more modern variant is the Integrated Encryption Scheme.\nForward secrecy.\nProtocols that achieve forward secrecy generate new key pairs for each session and discard them at the end of the session. The Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange is a frequent choice for such protocols, because of its fast key generation.\nPassword-authenticated key agreement.\nWhen Alice and Bob share a password, they may use a password-authenticated key agreement (PK) form of Diffie\u2013Hellman to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. One simple scheme is to compare the hash of s concatenated with the password calculated independently on both ends of channel. A feature of these schemes is that an attacker can only test one specific password on each iteration with the other party, and so the system provides good security with relatively weak passwords. This approach is described in ITU-T Recommendation X.1035, which is used by the G.hn home networking standard.\nAn example of such a protocol is the Secure Remote Password protocol.\nPublic key.\nIt is also possible to use Diffie\u2013Hellman as part of a public key infrastructure, allowing Bob to encrypt a message so that only Alice will be able to decrypt it, with no prior communication between them other than Bob having trusted knowledge of Alice's public key. Alice's public key is formula_3. To send her a message, Bob chooses a random \"b\" and then sends Alice formula_4 (unencrypted) together with the message encrypted with symmetric key formula_5. Only Alice can determine the symmetric key and hence decrypt the message because only she has \"a\" (the private key). A pre-shared public key also prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.\nIn practice, Diffie\u2013Hellman is not used in this way, with RSA being the dominant public key algorithm. This is largely for historical and commercial reasons, namely that RSA Security created a certificate authority for key signing that became Verisign. Diffie\u2013Hellman, as elaborated above, cannot directly be used to sign certificates. However, the ElGamal and DSA signature algorithms are mathematically related to it, as well as MQV, STS and the IKE component of the IPsec protocol suite for securing Internet Protocol communications."}

The supporting cast includes Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, Brian Donlevy, Allen Jenkins, Irene Hervey, Billy Gilbert, Bill Cody Jr., Lillian Yarbo, and Una Merkel.\nThe opening credits list the story as \"Suggested by Max Brand's novel \"Destry Rides Again\"\", but the movie is almost completely different. It also bears no resemblance to the 1932 adaptation of the novel starring Tom Mix, which is often retitled as \"Justice Rides Again\".\nIn 1996, \"Destry Rides Again\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nSaloon owner Kent, the unscrupulous boss of the fictional Western town of Bottleneck, has the town's sheriff, Mr. Keogh, killed when Keogh asks one too many questions about a rigged poker game. Kent and Frenchy, a cheap saloon tramp who is his girlfriend, now have a stranglehold over the local cattle ranchers. The town's crooked mayor, Hiram J. Slade, who is in collusion with Kent, appoints the town drunk, Washington Dimsdale, as the new sheriff, assuming that he will be easy to control and manipulate. However, Dimsdale, a deputy under the famous lawman Tom Destry, promptly swears off drinking, and is able to call upon the latter's equally formidable son, Tom Destry Jr., to help him make Bottleneck a lawful, respectable town.\nDestry arrives in Bottleneck with Jack Tyndall, a cattleman, and his sister, Janice. Destry initially confounds the townsfolk by refusing to strap on a gun and maintaining civility in dealing with everyone, including Kent and Frenchy. This quickly makes him a disappointment to Dimsdale and a laughingstock to the townspeople; he is mockingly asked to \"clean up\" Bottleneck by being given a mop and bucket. However, after a number of rowdy horsemen ride into town shooting their pistols in the air, he demonstrates uncanny expertise in marksmanship and threatens to jail them if they do it again, earning the respect of Bottleneck's citizens.\nThrough the townsmen's evasive answers regarding the whereabouts of Keogh, Destry gradually begins to suspect that Keogh was murdered. He confirms this by provoking Frenchy into admitting it, but without a location for the body, he lacks any proof. Destry therefore deputizes Boris, a Russian immigrant whom Frenchy had earlier humiliated, and implies to Kent that he had found the body outside of town \"in remarkably good condition\". When Kent sends a member of his gang to check on Keogh's burial site, Boris and Dimsdale follow, capture, and jail him.\nAlthough the gang member is charged with Keogh's murder (in the hope that he would implicate Kent in exchange for clemency), Mayor Slade appoints himself judge of the trial, making an innocent verdict a foregone conclusion. To prevent this, Destry calls in a judge from a larger city in secret, but the plan is ruined after Boris accidentally gives away the other judge's name in the saloon. Kent orders Frenchy to invite the deputy to her house while other gang members storm the sheriff's office and cause a breakout; now in love with Destry, she accepts. When shots are fired, he rushes back, to find the cell empty and Dimsdale mortally wounded. Destry returns to his room and puts on his gun belt, abandoning his previous commitment to nonviolence.\nUnder Destry's command, the honest townsmen form a posse and prepare to attack the saloon, where Kent's gang is fortified, while Destry enters through the roof and looks for Kent. At Frenchy's urging, the townswomen march in between the groups, preventing further violence, before breaking into the saloon and subduing the gang. Kent narrowly escapes, and attempts to shoot Destry from the second floor; Frenchy takes the bullet for him, killing her, and Destry kills Kent.\nSome time later, Destry is shown to be the sheriff of a now lawful Bottleneck, repeating to children the stories that Dimsdale told him of the town's violent history. He jokingly tells a story about marriage to Janice, implying a marriage between them will soon follow.\nCast.\nAs appearing in screen credits:\nSongs.\nDietrich sings \"See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have\" and \"You've Got That Look\", written by Frank Loesser, set to music by Frederick Hollander, which have become classics, as well as a revised version of Little Joe the Wrangler.\nProduction.\nWestern writer Max Brand contributed the novel, \"Destry Rides Again\", but the film also owes its origins to Brand's serial \"Twelve Peers\", published in a pulp magazine. In the original work, Harrison (or \"Harry\") Destry was not a pacifist. As filmed in 1932, with Tom Mix in the starring role, the central character differed in that Destry did wear six-guns.\nThe film was James Stewart's first Western (he would not return to the genre until 1950, with \"Winchester '73\", followed by \"Broken Arrow\"). The story featured a ferocious cat-fight between Marlene Dietrich and Una Merkel, which apparently caused a mild censorship problem at the time of release.\nThe film also represented Dietrich's return to Hollywood after a string of flops at Paramount (\"Angel\", \"The Scarlet Empress\", \"The Devil is a Woman\") caused her, and a number of other stars, to be labelled \"box office poison\". While vacationing at Cap d'Antibes with her family, her mentor Josef von Sternberg and her lover Erich Maria Remarque, she received an offer from Joe Pasternak to come to Universal at half the salary she had been receiving for most of the 1930s. Pasternak had previously tried to sign Dietrich to Universal while she was still in Berlin. Unsure of what to do she was advised by von Sternberg \"I made you into a Goddess. Now show them you have feet of clay\".\nAccording to writer/director Peter Bogdanovich, Marlene Dietrich told him during an aircraft flight that she and James Stewart had an affair during shooting and that she became pregnant but had a surreptitious abortion without telling Stewart.\nInternationally, the film was released under the alternative titles \"\" in French and \"Arizona\" in Spanish.\nReception.\n\"Destry Rides Again\" was generally well accepted by the public, as well as critics. It was reviewed by Frank S. Nugent in \"The New York Times\", who observed that the film did not follow the usual Hollywood type-casting. On Dietrich's role, he characterized: \"It's difficult to reconcile Miss Dietrich's Frenchy, the cabaret girl of the Bloody Gulch Saloon, with the posed and posturing Dietrich we last saw in Mr. Lubitsch's 'Angel'.\" Stewart's contribution was similarly treated, \"turning in an easy, likable, pleasantly humored performance.\"\nIn popular culture.\nMarlene Dietrich's character, Frenchy, was the inspiration for the character of Lili Von Shtupp in the Western parody \"Blazing Saddles\". In the movie, \"Drag Me To Hell\", the film can be seen playing on a TV behind the counter at the pawn shop.\nReferences.\nNotes\nBibliography"}

The derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. The tangent line is the best linear approximation of the function near that input value. For this reason, the derivative is often described as the instantaneous rate of change, the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable. The process of finding a derivative is called differentiation.\nThere are multiple different notations for differentiation, two of the most commonly used being Leibniz notation and prime notation. Leibniz notation, named after Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, is represented as the ratio of two differentials, whereas prime notation is written by adding a prime mark. Higher order notations represent repeated differentiation, and they are usually denoted in Leibniz notation by adding superscripts to the differentials, and in prime notation by adding additional prime marks. The higher order derivatives can be applied in physics; for example, while the first derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the object's velocity, how the position changes as time advances, the second derivative is the object's acceleration, how the velocity changes as time advances.\nDerivatives can be generalized to functions of several real variables. In this generalization, the derivative is reinterpreted as a linear transformation whose graph is (after an appropriate translation) the best linear approximation to the graph of the original function. The Jacobian matrix is the matrix that represents this linear transformation with respect to the basis given by the choice of independent and dependent variables. It can be calculated in terms of the partial derivatives with respect to the independent variables. For a real-valued function of several variables, the Jacobian matrix reduces to the gradient vector.\nDefinition.\nAs a limit.\nA function of a real variable formula_1 is differentiable at a point formula_2 of its domain, if its domain contains an open interval containing , and the limit\nformula_3\nexists. This means that, for every positive real number , there exists a positive real number formula_4 such that, for every formula_5 such that formula_6 and formula_7 then formula_8 is defined, and \nformula_9\nwhere the vertical bars denote the absolute value. This is an example of the (\u03b5, \u03b4)-definition of limit.\nIf the function formula_10 is differentiable at , that is if the limit formula_11 exists, then this limit is called the \"derivative\" of formula_10 at formula_2. Multiple notations for the derivative exist. The derivative of formula_10 at formula_2 can be denoted , read as \" prime of \"; or it can be denoted , read as \"the derivative of formula_10 with respect to formula_17 at \" or \" by (or over) formula_18 at \". See \"\" below. If formula_10 is a function that has a derivative at every point in its domain, then a function can be defined by mapping every point formula_17 to the value of the derivative of formula_10 at formula_17. This function is written formula_23 and is called the \"derivative function\" or the \"derivative of\" . The function formula_10 sometimes has a derivative at most, but not all, points of its domain. The function whose value at formula_2 equals formula_26 whenever formula_26 is defined and elsewhere is undefined is also called the derivative of . It is still a function, but its domain may be smaller than the domain of formula_10.\nFor example, let formula_29 be the squaring function: formula_30. Then the quotient in the definition of the derivative is\nformula_31\nThe division in the last step is valid as long as formula_32. The closer formula_33 is to , the closer this expression becomes to the value formula_34. The limit exists, and for every input formula_35 the limit is formula_34. So, the derivative of the squaring function is the doubling function: .\nThe ratio in the definition of the derivative is the slope of the line through two points on the graph of the function , specifically the points formula_37 and formula_38. As formula_33 is made smaller, these points grow closer together, and the slope of this line approaches the limiting value, the slope of the tangent to the graph of formula_29 at formula_35. In other words, the derivative is the slope of the tangent.\nUsing infinitesimals.\nOne way to think of the derivative formula_42 is as the ratio of an infinitesimal change in the output of the function formula_29 to an infinitesimal change in its input. In order to make this intuition rigorous, a system of rules for manipulating infinitesimal quantities is required. The system of hyperreal numbers is a way of treating infinite and infinitesimal quantities. The hyperreals are an extension of the real numbers that contain numbers greater than anything of the form formula_44 for any finite number of terms. Such numbers are infinite, and their reciprocals are infinitesimals. The application of hyperreal numbers to the foundations of calculus is called nonstandard analysis. This provides a way to define the basic concepts of calculus such as the derivative and integral in terms of infinitesimals, thereby giving a precise meaning to the formula_45 in the Leibniz notation. Thus, the derivative of formula_46 becomes formula_47 for an arbitrary infinitesimal , where formula_48 denotes the standard part function, which \"rounds off\" each finite hyperreal to the nearest real. Taking the squaring function formula_30 as an example again,\nformula_50\nContinuity and differentiability.\nIf formula_10 is differentiable at , then formula_10 must also be continuous at formula_2. As an example, choose a point formula_2 and let formula_10 be the step function that returns the value 1 for all formula_17 less than , and returns a different value 10 for all formula_17 greater than or equal to formula_2. The function formula_10 cannot have a derivative at formula_2. If formula_5 is negative, then formula_62 is on the low part of the step, so the secant line from formula_2 to formula_62 is very steep; as formula_5 tends to zero, the slope tends to infinity. If formula_5 is positive, then formula_62 is on the high part of the step, so the secant line from formula_2 to formula_62 has slope zero. Consequently, the secant lines do not approach any single slope, so the limit of the difference quotient does not exist. However, even if a function is continuous at a point, it may not be differentiable there. For example, the absolute value function given by formula_70 is continuous at , but it is not differentiable there. If formula_5 is positive, then the slope of the secant line from 0 to formula_5 is one; if formula_5 is negative, then the slope of the secant line from formula_74 to formula_5 is . This can be seen graphically as a \"kink\" or a \"cusp\" in the graph at formula_76. Even a function with a smooth graph is not differentiable at a point where its tangent is vertical: For instance, the function given by formula_77 is not differentiable at formula_78. In summary, a function that has a derivative is continuous, but there are continuous functions that do not have a derivative.\nMost functions that occur in practice have derivatives at all points or almost every point. Early in the history of calculus, many mathematicians assumed that a continuous function was differentiable at most points. Under mild conditions (for example, if the function is a monotone or a Lipschitz function), this is true. However, in 1872, Weierstrass found the first example of a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere. This example is now known as the Weierstrass function. In 1931, Stefan Banach proved that the set of functions that have a derivative at some point is a meager set in the space of all continuous functions. Informally, this means that hardly any random continuous functions have a derivative at even one point.\nNotation.\nOne common way of writing the derivative of a function is Leibniz notation, introduced by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1675, which denotes a derivative as the quotient of two differentials, such as formula_79 and . It is still commonly used when the equation formula_80 is viewed as a functional relationship between dependent and independent variables. The first derivative is denoted by , read as \"the derivative of formula_81 with respect to \". This derivative can alternately be treated as the application of a differential operator to a function, formula_82 Higher derivatives are expressed using the notation formula_83 for the formula_84-th derivative of formula_85. These are abbreviations for multiple applications of the derivative operator; for example, formula_86 Unlike some alternatives, Leibniz notation involves explicit specification of the variable for differentiation, in the denominator, which removes ambiguity when working with multiple interrelated quantities. The derivative of a composed function can be expressed using the chain rule: if formula_87 and formula_88 then formula_89\nAnother common notation for differentiation is by using the prime mark in the symbol of a function . This is known as \"prime notation\", due to Joseph-Louis Lagrange. The first derivative is written as , read as \" prime of , or , read as \" prime\". Similarly, the second and the third derivatives can be written as formula_90 and , respectively. For denoting the number of higher derivatives beyond this point, some authors use Roman numerals in superscript, whereas others place the number in parentheses, such as formula_91 or . The latter notation generalizes to yield the notation formula_92 for the th derivative of .\nIn Newton's notation or the \"dot notation,\" a dot is placed over a symbol to represent a time derivative. If formula_81 is a function of , then the first and second derivatives can be written as formula_94 and , respectively. This notation is used exclusively for derivatives with respect to time or arc length. It is typically used in differential equations in physics and differential geometry. However, the dot notation becomes unmanageable for high-order derivatives (of order 4 or more) and cannot deal with multiple independent variables.\nAnother notation is \"D-notation\", which represents the differential operator by the symbol . The first derivative is written formula_95 and higher derivatives are written with a superscript, so the formula_84-th derivative is . This notation is sometimes called \"Euler notation\", although it seems that Leonhard Euler did not use it, and the notation was introduced by Louis Fran\u00e7ois Antoine Arbogast. To indicate a partial derivative, the variable differentiated by is indicated with a subscript, for example given the function , its partial derivative with respect to formula_97 can be written formula_98 or . Higher partial derivatives can be indicated by superscripts or multiple subscripts, e.g. formula_99 and .\nRules of computation.\nIn principle, the derivative of a function can be computed from the definition by considering the difference quotient and computing its limit. Once the derivatives of a few simple functions are known, the derivatives of other functions are more easily computed using \"rules\" for obtaining derivatives of more complicated functions from simpler ones. This process of finding a derivative is known as differentiation.\nRules for basic functions.\nThe following are the rules for the derivatives of the most common basic functions. Here, formula_2 is a real number, and formula_101 is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately. \nRules for combined functions.\nGiven that the formula_10 and formula_119 are the functions. The following are some of the most basic rules for deducing the derivative of functions from derivatives of basic functions.\nComputation example.\nThe derivative of the function given by formula_135 is\nformula_136\nHere the second term was computed using the chain rule and the third term using the product rule. The known derivatives of the elementary functions formula_137, formula_138, formula_139, formula_140, and formula_141, as well as the constant formula_142, were also used.\nHigher-order derivatives.\n\"Higher order derivatives\" are the result of differentiating a function repeatedly. Given that formula_10 is a differentiable function, the derivative of formula_10 is the first derivative, denoted as . The derivative of formula_23 is the second derivative, denoted as , and the derivative of formula_90 is the third derivative, denoted as . By continuing this process, if it exists, the th derivative is the derivative of the th derivative or the \"derivative of order \". As has been discussed above, the generalization of derivative of a function formula_10 may be denoted as . A function that has formula_148 successive derivatives is called \"formula_148 times differentiable\". If the th derivative is continuous, then the function is said to be of differentiability class . A function that has infinitely many derivatives is called \"infinitely differentiable\" or \"smooth\". Any polynomial function is infinitely differentiable; taking derivatives repeatedly will eventually result in a constant function, and all subsequent derivatives of that function are zero.\nOne application of higher-order derivatives is in physics. Suppose that a function represents the position of an object at the time. The first derivative of that function is the velocity of an object with respect to time, the second derivative of the function is the acceleration of an object with respect to time, and the third derivative is the jerk.\nIn other dimensions.\nVector-valued functions.\nA vector-valued function formula_150 of a real variable sends real numbers to vectors in some vector space formula_151. A vector-valued function can be split up into its coordinate functions formula_152, meaning that formula_153. This includes, for example, parametric curves in formula_154 or formula_155. The coordinate functions are real-valued functions, so the above definition of derivative applies to them. The derivative of formula_156 is defined to be the vector, called the tangent vector, whose coordinates are the derivatives of the coordinate functions. That is,\nformula_157\nif the limit exists. The subtraction in the numerator is the subtraction of vectors, not scalars. If the derivative of formula_150 exists for every value of , then formula_159 is another vector-valued function.\nPartial derivatives.\nFunctions can depend upon more than one variable. A partial derivative of a function of several variables is its derivative with respect to one of those variables, with the others held constant. Partial derivatives are used in vector calculus and differential geometry. As with ordinary derivatives, multiple notations exist: the partial derivative of a function formula_160 with respect to the variable formula_97 is variously denoted by\namong other possibilities. It can be thought of as the rate of change of the function in the formula_97-direction. Here \u2202 is a rounded \"d\" called the partial derivative symbol. To distinguish it from the letter \"d\", \u2202 is sometimes pronounced \"der\", \"del\", or \"partial\" instead of \"dee\". For example, let , then the partial derivative of function formula_10 with respect to both variables formula_17 and formula_81 are, respectively:\nformula_166\nIn general, the partial derivative of a function formula_167 in the direction formula_168 at the point formula_169 is defined to be:\nformula_170\nThis is fundamental for the study of the functions of several real variables. Let formula_167 be such a real-valued function. If all partial derivatives formula_10 with respect to formula_173 are defined at the point , these partial derivatives define the vector\nformula_174\nwhich is called the gradient of formula_10 at formula_2. If formula_10 is differentiable at every point in some domain, then the gradient is a vector-valued function formula_178 that maps the point formula_179 to the vector formula_180. Consequently, the gradient determines a vector field.\nDirectional derivatives.\nIf formula_10 is a real-valued function on , then the partial derivatives of formula_10 measure its variation in the direction of the coordinate axes. For example, if formula_10 is a function of formula_17 and , then its partial derivatives measure the variation in formula_10 in the formula_17 and formula_81 direction. However, they do not directly measure the variation of formula_10 in any other direction, such as along the diagonal line . These are measured using directional derivatives. Given a vector , then the directional derivative of formula_10 in the direction of formula_190 at the point formula_191 is:\nformula_192\nIf all the partial derivatives of formula_10 exist and are continuous at , then they determine the directional derivative of formula_10 in the direction formula_190 by the formula:\nformula_196\nTotal derivative, total differential and Jacobian matrix.\nWhen formula_10 is a function from an open subset of formula_151 to , then the directional derivative of formula_10 in a chosen direction is the best linear approximation to formula_10 at that point and in that direction. However, when , no single directional derivative can give a complete picture of the behavior of formula_10. The total derivative gives a complete picture by considering all directions at once. That is, for any vector formula_190 starting at , the linear approximation formula holds:\nformula_203\nSimilarly with the single-variable derivative, formula_204 is chosen so that the error in this approximation is as small as possible. The total derivative of formula_10 at formula_206 is the unique linear transformation formula_207 such that\nformula_208\nHere formula_209 is a vector in , so the norm in the denominator is the standard length on formula_151. However, formula_211 is a vector in , and the norm in the numerator is the standard length on formula_212. If formula_213 is a vector starting at , then formula_214 is called the pushforward of formula_190 by formula_10.\nIf the total derivative exists at , then all the partial derivatives and directional derivatives of formula_10 exist at , and for all , formula_218 is the directional derivative of formula_10 in the direction . If formula_10 is written using coordinate functions, so that , then the total derivative can be expressed using the partial derivatives as a matrix. This matrix is called the Jacobian matrix of formula_10 at formula_206:\nformula_223\nGeneralizations.\nThe concept of a derivative can be extended to many other settings. The common thread is that the derivative of a function at a point serves as a linear approximation of the function at that point."}
{"id": "7922", "revid": "45520563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7922", "title": "Dravidian languages", "text": "The Dravidian languages are a family of languages spoken by 250 million people, mainly in South India, north-east Sri Lanka, and south-west Pakistan, with pockets elsewhere in South Asia.\nDravidian is first attested in the 2nd century BCE, as inscriptions in Tamil-Brahmi script on cave walls in the Madurai and Tirunelveli districts of Tamil Nadu.\nThe most commonly spoken Dravidian languages are (in descending order) Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and Malayalam, all of which have long literary traditions.\nSmaller literary languages are Tulu and Kodava.\nTogether with several smaller languages such as Gondi, these languages cover the southern part of India and the northeast of Sri Lanka, and account for the overwhelming majority of speakers of Dravidian languages.\nMalto and Kurukh are spoken in isolated pockets in eastern India.\nKurukh is also spoken in parts of Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. Brahui is mostly spoken in the Balochistan region of Pakistan, Iranian Balochistan, Afghanistan and around the Marw oasis in Turkmenistan. \nDuring the colonial period in India, Dravidian speakers were exploited by the colonial empires and sent as indentured servants to Southeast Asia, Mauritius, South Africa, Fiji and the Caribbean to work on plantations, and to East Africa to work on British railroads. There are more-recent Dravidian-speaking diaspora communities in the Middle East, Europe, North America and Oceania.\nThe reconstructed proto-language of the family is known as proto-Dravidian. Dravidian place names along the Arabian Sea coast and clear signs of Dravidian phonological and grammatical influence (e.g. retroflex consonants and clusivity) in the Indo-Aryan languages suggest that Dravidian languages were spoken more widely across the Indian subcontinent before the spread of the Indo-Aryan languages. Though some scholars have argued that the Dravidian languages may have been brought to India by migrations from the Iranian plateau in the fourth or third millennium BCE, or even earlier, the reconstructed vocabulary of proto-Dravidian suggests that the family is indigenous to India. Despite many attempts, the family has not been shown to be related to any other.\nDravidian studies.\nThe 14th-century Sanskrit text \"Lilatilakam\", a grammar of Manipravalam, states that the spoken languages of present-day Kerala and Tamil Nadu were similar, terming them as \"Drami\u1e0da\". The author does not consider the \"Kar\u1e47\u1e47\u0101\u1e6da\" (Kannada) and the \"\u0100ndhra\" (Telugu) languages as \"Drami\u1e0da\", because they were very different from the language of the \"Tamil Veda\" (\"Tiruvaymoli\"), but states that some people would include them in the \"Drami\u1e0da\" category.\nIn 1816, Francis Whyte Ellis argued that Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Tulu and Kodava descended from a common, non-Indo-European ancestor. He supported his argument with a detailed comparison of non-Sanskrit vocabulary in Telugu, Kannada and Tamil, and also demonstrated that they shared grammatical structures. In 1844, Christian Lassen discovered that Brahui was related to these languages. In 1856, Robert Caldwell published his \"Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian Family of Languages\", which considerably expanded the Dravidian umbrella and established Dravidian as one of the major language groups of the world.\nIn 1961, T. Burrow and M. B. Emeneau published the \"Dravidian Etymological Dictionary\", with a major revision in 1984.\nName.\nRobert Caldwell coined the term \"Dravidian\" for this family of languages, based on the usage of the Sanskrit word in the work \"Tantrav\u0101rttika\" by :\nThe origin of the Sanskrit word ' is the Tamil word '. Kamil Zvelebil cites the forms such as \"dramila\" (in 's Sanskrit work \"Avantisundar\u012bkath\u0101\") and ' (found in the Sri Lankan (Ceylonese) chronicle \"Mahavamsa\") and then goes on to say, \"The forms \"dami\u1e37a\"/\"damila\" almost certainly provide a connection of '\" with the indigenous name of the Tamil language, the likely derivation being \"*' &gt; *' &gt; '- / \"damila\"- and further, with the intrusive, 'hypercorrect' (or perhaps analogical) -\"r\"-, into '. The -\"m\"-/-\"v\"- alternation is a common enough phenomenon in Dravidian phonology\".\nBhadriraju Krishnamurti states in his reference book \"The Dravidian languages\": \nBased on what Krishnamurti states (referring to a scholarly paper published in the \"International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics\"), the Sanskrit word ' itself appeared later than ', since the dates for the forms with -r- are centuries later than the dates for the forms without -r- (', '-, \"damela\"- etc.).\nClassification.\nThe Dravidian languages form a close-knit family. Most scholars agree on four groups:\nThere are different proposals regarding the relationship between these groups. Earlier classifications grouped Central and South-Central Dravidian in a single branch. On the other hand, Krishnamurti groups South-Central and South Dravidian together. There are other disagreements, including whether there is a Toda-Kota branch or whether Kota diverged first and later Toda (claimed by Krishnamurti).\nSome authors deny that North Dravidian forms a valid subgroup, splitting it into Northeast (Kurukh\u2013Malto) and Northwest (Brahui). Their affiliation has been proposed based primarily on a small number of common phonetic developments, including:\nMcAlpin (2003) notes that no exact conditioning can be established for the first two changes, and proposes that distinct Proto-Dravidian *q and *k\u02b2 should be reconstructed behind these correspondences, and that Brahui, Kurukh-Malto, and the rest of Dravidian may be three coordinate branches, possibly with Brahui being the earliest language to split off. A few morphological parallels between Brahui and Kurukh-Malto are also known, but according to McAlpin they are analysable as shared archaisms rather than shared innovations.\nIn addition, \"Glottolog\" lists several unclassified Dravidian languages: Kumbaran, Kakkala (both of Tamil-Malayalam) and Khirwar.\nA computational phylogenetic study of the Dravidian language family was undertaken by Kolipakam, et al. (2018). They support the internal coherence of the four Dravidian branches South (or South Dravidian I), South-Central (or South Dravidian II), Central, and North, but is uncertain about the precise relationships of these four branches to each other. The date of Dravidian is estimated to be 4,500 years old.\nDistribution.\nDravidian languages are mostly located in the southern and central parts of south Asia with 2 main outliers, Brahui having speakers in Balochistan and as far north are Merv, Turkmenistan and Kurukh to the east in Jharkhand and as far northeast as Bhutan, Nepal and Assam. Historically Maharashtra, Gujarat and Sindh also had Dravidian speaking populations from the evidence of place names (like \"-v(a)li, -ko\u1e6d\" from Dravidian \"pa\u1e37\u1e37i, k\u014d\u1e6d\u1e6dai\"), grammatical features in Marathi, Gujarati, and Sindhi and Dravidian like kinship systems in southern Indo\u2013Aryan languages. Proto-Dravidian could have been spoken in a wider area, perhaps into Central India or the western Deccan which may have had other forms of early Dravidian/pre-Proto-Dravidian or other branches of Dravidian which are currently unknown.\nSince 1981, the Census of India has reported only languages with more than 10,000 speakers, including 17 Dravidian languages. In 1981, these accounted for approximately 24% of India's population.\nIn the 2001 census, they included 214 million people, about 21% of India's total population of 1.02 billion. In addition, the largest Dravidian-speaking group outside India, Tamil speakers in Sri Lanka, number around 4.7 million. The total number of speakers of Dravidian languages is around 227 million people, around 13% of the population of the Indian subcontinent.\nThe largest group of the Dravidian languages is South Dravidian, with almost 150 million speakers. Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam make up around 98% of the speakers, with 75 million, 44 million and 37 million native speakers, respectively.\nThe next-largest is the South-Central branch, which has 78 million native speakers, the vast majority of whom speak Telugu. The total number of speakers of Telugu, including those whose first language is not Telugu, is around 85 million people. This branch also includes the tribal language Gondi spoken in central India.\nThe second-smallest branch is the Northern branch, with around 6.3 million speakers. This is the only sub-group to have a language spoken in Pakistan \u2013 Brahui.\nThe smallest branch is the Central branch, which has only around 200,000 speakers. These languages are mostly tribal, and spoken in central India.\nLanguages recognized as official languages of India appear here in boldface.\nProposed relations with other families.\nResearchers have tried but have been unable to prove a connection between the Dravidian languages with other language families, including Indo-European, Hurrian, Basque, Sumerian, Korean, and Japanese. Comparisons have been made not just with the other language families of the Indian subcontinent (Indo-European, Austroasiatic, Sino-Tibetan, and Nihali), but with all typologically similar language families of the Old World. Nonetheless, although there are no readily detectable genealogical connections, Dravidian shares several areal features with the Indo-Aryan languages, which have been attributed to the influence of a Dravidian substratum on Indo-Aryan.\nDravidian languages display typological similarities with the Uralic language group, and there have been several attempts to establish a genetic relationship in the past. This idea has been popular amongst Dravidian linguists, including Robert Caldwell, Thomas Burrow, Kamil Zvelebil, and Mikhail Andronov. The hypothesis is, however, rejected by most specialists in Uralic languages, and also in recent times by Dravidian linguists such as Bhadriraju Krishnamurti.\nIn the early 1970s, the linguist David McAlpin produced a detailed proposal of a genetic relationship between Dravidian and the extinct Elamite language of ancient Elam (present-day southwestern Iran). The Elamo-Dravidian hypothesis was supported in the late 1980s by the archaeologist Colin Renfrew and the geneticist Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, who suggested that Proto-Dravidian was brought to India by farmers from the Iranian part of the Fertile Crescent. (In his 2000 book, Cavalli-Sforza suggested western India, northern India and northern Iran as alternative starting points.) However, linguists have found McAlpin's cognates unconvincing and criticized his proposed phonological rules as \"ad hoc\". Elamite is generally believed by scholars to be a language isolate, and the theory has had no effect on studies of the language. In 2012, Southworth suggested a \"Zagrosian family\" of West Asian origin including Elamite, Brahui and Dravidian as its three branches.\nDravidian is one of the primary language families in the Nostratic proposal, which would link most languages in North Africa, Europe and Western Asia into a family with its origins in the Fertile Crescent sometime between the Last Glacial Period and the emergence of Proto-Indo-European 4,000\u20136,000 BCE. However, the general consensus is that such deep connections are not, or not yet, demonstrable.\nPrehistory.\nThe origins of the Dravidian languages, as well as their subsequent development and the period of their differentiation are unclear, partially due to the lack of comparative linguistic research into the Dravidian languages. It is thought that the Dravidian languages were the most widespread indigenous languages in the Indian subcontinent before the advance of the Indo-Aryan languages. Though some scholars have argued that the Dravidian languages may have been brought to India by migrations from the Iranian plateau in the fourth or third millennium BCE or even earlier, reconstructed proto-Dravidian vocabulary suggests that the family is indigenous to India.\nProto-Dravidian and onset of diversification.\nAs a proto-language, the Proto-Dravidian language is not itself attested in the historical record. Its modern conception is based solely on reconstruction. It was suggested in the 1980s that the language was spoken in the 4th millennium BCE, and started disintegrating into various branches around the 3rd millennium BCE. According to Krishnamurti, Proto-Dravidian may have been spoken in the Indus civilization, suggesting a \"tentative date of Proto-Dravidian around the early part of the third millennium.\" Krishnamurti further states that South Dravidian I (including pre-Tamil) and South Dravidian II (including Pre-Telugu) split around the 11th century BCE, with the other major branches splitting off at around the same time. Kolipakam et al. (2018) give a similar estimate of 2,500 BCE for Proto-Dravidian.\nHistorically Maharashtra, Gujarat and Sindh also had Dravidian speaking populations from the evidence of place names (like \"-v(a)li, -ko\u1e6d\" from Dravidian \"pa\u1e37\u1e37i, k\u014d\u1e6d\u1e6dai\"), grammatical features in Marathi, Gujarati, and Sindhi and Dravidian like kinship systems in southern Indo\u2013Aryan languages. Proto-Dravidian could have been spoken in a wider area, perhaps into Central India or the western Deccan which may have had other forms of early Dravidian/pre-Proto-Dravidian or other branches of Dravidian which are currently unknown.\nSeveral geneticists have noted a strong correlation between Dravidian and the Ancestral South Indian (ASI) component of South Asian genetic makeup. Narasimhan et al. (2019) argue that the ASI component itself formed in the early 2nd millennium BCE from a mixture of a population associated with the Indus Valley civilization and a population resident in peninsular India. They conclude that one of these two groups may have been the source of proto-Dravidian. An Indus valley origin would be consistent with the location of Brahui and with attempts to interpret the Indus script as Dravidian. On the other hand, reconstructed Proto-Dravidian terms for flora and fauna provide support for a peninsular Indian origin.\nIndus Valley Civilisation.\nThe Indus Valley civilisation (3300\u20131900 BCE), located in the Indus Valley region, is sometimes suggested to have been Dravidian. Already in 1924, after discovering the Indus Valley Civilisation, John Marshall stated that (one of) the language(s) may have been Dravidic. Cultural and linguistic similarities have been cited by researchers Henry Heras, Kamil Zvelebil, Asko Parpola and Iravatham Mahadevan as being strong evidence for a proto-Dravidian origin of the ancient Indus Valley civilisation. The discovery in Tamil Nadu of a late Neolithic (early 2nd millennium BCE, i.e. post-dating Harappan decline) stone celt allegedly marked with Indus signs has been considered by some to be significant for the Dravidian identification.\nYuri Knorozov surmised that the symbols represent a logosyllabic script and suggested, based on computer analysis, an underlying agglutinative Dravidian language as the most likely candidate for the underlying language. Knorozov's suggestion was preceded by the work of Henry Heras, who suggested several readings of signs based on a proto-Dravidian assumption.\nLinguist Asko Parpola writes that the Indus script and Harappan language are \"most likely to have belonged to the Dravidian family\". Parpola led a Finnish team in investigating the inscriptions using computer analysis. Based on a proto-Dravidian assumption, they proposed readings of many signs, some agreeing with the suggested readings of Heras and Knorozov (such as equating the \"fish\" sign with the Dravidian word for fish, \"min\") but disagreeing on several other readings. A comprehensive description of Parpola's work until 1994 is given in his book \"Deciphering the Indus Script\".\nNorthern Dravidian pockets.\nAlthough in modern times speakers of the various Dravidian languages have mainly occupied the southern portion of India, in earlier times they probably were spoken in a larger area. After the Indo-Aryan migrations into north-western India, starting , and the establishment of the Kuru kingdom , a process of Sanskritisation of the masses started, which resulted in a language shift in northern India. Southern India has remained majority Dravidian, but pockets of Dravidian can be found in central India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal.\nThe Kurukh and Malto are pockets of Dravidian languages in central India, spoken by people who may have migrated from south India. They do have myths about external origins. The Kurukh have traditionally claimed to be from the Deccan Peninsula, more specifically Karnataka. The same tradition has existed of the Brahui, who call themselves immigrants. Holding this same view of the Brahui are many scholars such as L.H. Horace Perera and M.Ratnasabapathy.\nThe Brahui population of Pakistan's Balochistan province has been taken by some as the linguistic equivalent of a relict population, perhaps indicating that Dravidian languages were formerly much more widespread and were supplanted by the incoming Indo-Aryan languages. However, it has been argued that the absence of any Old Iranian (Avestan) loanwords in Brahui suggests that the Brahui migrated to Balochistan from central India less than 1,000 years ago. The main Iranian contributor to Brahui vocabulary, Balochi, is a western Iranian language like Kurdish, and arrived in the area from the west only around 1000 CE. Sound changes shared with Kurukh and Malto also suggest that Brahui was originally spoken near them in central India.\nDravidian influence on Sanskrit.\nDravidian languages show extensive lexical (vocabulary) borrowing, but only a few traits of structural (either phonological or grammatical) borrowing from Indo-Aryan, whereas Indo-Aryan shows more structural than lexical borrowings from the Dravidian languages. Many of these features are already present in the oldest known Indo-Aryan language, the language of the \"Rigveda\" (c.1500 BCE), which also includes over a dozen words borrowed from Dravidian.\nVedic Sanskrit has retroflex consonants (/, ) with about 88 words in the \"Rigveda\" having unconditioned retroflexes. Some sample words are ', ', ', ', ' and '.\nSince other Indo-European languages, including other Indo-Iranian languages, lack retroflex consonants, their presence in Indo-Aryan is often cited as evidence of substrate influence from close contact of the Vedic speakers with speakers of a foreign language family rich in retroflex consonants. The Dravidian family is a serious candidate since it is rich in retroflex phonemes reconstructible back to the Proto-Dravidian stage.\nIn addition, a number of grammatical features of Vedic Sanskrit not found in its sister Avestan language appear to have been borrowed from Dravidian languages. These include the gerund, which has the same function as in Dravidian. Some linguists explain this asymmetrical borrowing by arguing that Middle Indo-Aryan languages were built on a Dravidian substratum. These scholars argue that the most plausible explanation for the presence of Dravidian structural features in Indic is language shift, that is, native Dravidian speakers learning and adopting Indic languages due to elite dominance. Although each of the innovative traits in Indic could be accounted for by internal explanations, early Dravidian influence is the only explanation that can account for all of the innovations at once; moreover, it accounts for several of the innovative traits in Indic better than any internal explanation that has been proposed.\nPhonology.\nProto-Dravidian, unlike Sanskrit and other Indo-Iranian languages languages of South Asia, lacked both an aspiration and voicing contrast. The situation varies considerably amongst its daughter languages and often also between registers of any single language. The vast majority of modern Dravidian languages generally have some voicing distinctions amongst stops; as for aspiration, it appears in at least the formal varieties of the so-called \"literary\" Dravidian languages (except Tamil) today, but may be rare or entirely absent in less formal registers, as well as in the many \"non-literary\" Dravidian languages.\nAt one extreme, Tamil, like Proto-Dravidian, does not phonemically distinguish between voiced and voiceless or unaspirated and aspirated sounds, even in formal speech; in fact, the Tamil alphabet lacks symbols for voiced and aspirated stops. At the other end, Brahui is exceptional among the Dravidian languages in possessing and commonly employing the entire inventory of aspirates employed in neighboring Sindhi. While aspirates are particularly concentrated in the Indo-Aryan element of the lexicon, some Brahui words with Dravidian roots have developed aspiration as well.\nMost languages lie in between. Voicing contrasts are quite common in all registers of speech in most Dravidian languages. Aspiration contrasts are less common, but relatively well-established in the phonologies of the higher or more formal registers, as well as in the standard orthographies, of the \"literary\" languages (other than Tamil): Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam. However, in colloquial or non-standard speech, aspiration often appears inconsistently or not at all, even if it occurs in the standard spelling of the word.\nIn the languages in which aspirates are found, they primarily occur in the large numbers of loanwords from Sanskrit and other Indo-Iranian languages, though some are found in etymologically native words as well, often as the result of plosive + laryngeal clusters being reanalysed as aspirates (e.g. Telugu , Kannada / , Adilabad Gondi ).\nDravidian languages are also historically characterized by a three-way distinction between dental, alveolar, and retroflex places of articulation as well as large numbers of liquids. Currently the three-way coronal distinction is only found in Malayalam, Sri Lankan Tamil, and the various languages of the Nilgiri Mountains, all of which belong to the Tamil\u2013Kannada branch of the family.\nAll other Dravidian languages maintain only a two-way distinction between dentals and retroflexes, largely the result of merging the alveolars with the dentals or retroflexes, or via rhotacization. The latter is found primarily among the South and South Central languages, where many languages merged the singular proto-Dravidian alveolar plosive \"*\u1e6f\" with the alveolar trill ; subsequently, in some of these languages, the trill evolved into the alveolar tap or underwent other sound changes (Tulu has as reflexes, Manda-Kui has , and Hill-Maria Gondi has ).\nProto-Dravidian.\nProto-Dravidian had five short and long vowels: \"*a\", \"*\u0101\", \"*i\", \"*\u012b\", \"*u\", \"*\u016b\", \"*e\", \"*\u0113\", \"*o\", \"*\u014d\". There were no diphthongs; \"ai\" and \"au\" are treated as *\"ay\" and *\"av\" (or *\"aw\").\nThe five-vowel system with phonemic length is largely preserved in the descendant subgroups, but there are some notable exceptions. The Nilgiri languages (except Kota but including Kodagu) developing a series of central vowels which formed from vowels near retroflex and alveolar consonants. The short \"u\" phoneme (mostly word finally) became \"\u016d/\u1ee5\" /\u026f~\u0268~\u0259/ and also became phonemic in Tulu and Malayalam, mostly caused by loaning words with rounded /u/. Brahui has slightly poorer vowel system, where short \"e\" and \"o\" merged with other vowels due to the influence of Indo-Aryan languages, leaving only long counterparts.\nThe following consonantal phonemes are reconstructed:\nGrammar.\nThe most characteristic grammatical features of Dravidian languages are:\nNominal morphology.\nNumber and gender.\nThe Dravidian languages have two numbers, singular and plural. The singular is unmarked, the plural is expressed by a suffix. The plural suffixes are \"-(n)k(k)a\" (cf. Kui 'cows', Brahui 'mouths'), *-\u1e37 (cf. Telugu 'trees', Ollari 'hands') and the combination of these two *-(n)k(k)a\u1e37 common in SD (cf. Tamil 'trees', Kannada 'trees').\nThe individual Dravidian languages have different gender systems. What they have in common is that the grammatical gender (genus) always corresponds to the natural gender of the word. In addition to individual special developments, there are three main types in which the categories \"male\" or \"non-male\" as well as \"human\" and \"non-human\" play a central role:\nThe three types are illustrated by the forms of the third-person demonstrative pronouns of the three languages:\nThere is no consensus as to which of these three types is the original.\nThe gender is not explicitly marked for all nouns. Thus in Telugu 'elder brother' is masculine and 'mother' non-masculine, without this being apparent from the pure form of the word. However, many nouns are formed with certain suffixes that express gender and number. For Proto-Dravidian, the suffixes *-an and *-an\u1e6f could be used for the masculine singular (cf. Tamil 'son', Telugu 'younger brother'), *-a\u1e37 and *-i for the singular feminine (cf. Kannada 'daughter', Malto 'girl') and *-ar for human plurals (cf. Malayalam 'two persons', Kurukh 'men').\nCase.\nCase is expressed by suffixes and more loosely connected postpositions. The number of cases varies between four (Telugu) and eleven (Brahui).\nThe nominative is always the unmarked base form of the word. The other cases, collectively called oblique, are formed by adding suffixes to a stem that can either be identical to the nominative or formed by certain suffixes (e.g. Tamil 'tree', oblique ). Several oblique suffixes can be reconstructed for Proto-Dravidian, which are composed of the minimal components *-i- , *-a- , *-n- and *-tt-. In many languages, the oblique is identical to the genitive.\nProto-Dravidian case suffixes can be reconstructed for the three cases accusative, dative and genitive. Other case suffixes only occur in individual branches of Dravidian.\nPronouns.\nPersonal pronouns occur in the 1st and 2nd person. In the 1st person plural there is an inclusive and exclusive form, that is, a distinction is made as to whether the person addressed is included. There is also a reflexive pronoun that refers to the subject of the sentence and is constructed in the same way as personal pronouns. The personal and reflexive pronouns reconstructed for Proto-Dravidian are listed in the table below. In addition, there are special developments in some languages: The south and south-central Dravidian languages have transferred the *\u00f1 initial sound of the 1st person plural inclusive to the 1st person singular (cf. Malayalam \"\u00f1\u0101n\", but oblique \"en\" &lt; *yan). The differences between the forms for the inclusive and exclusive we are partly blurred; Kannada has completely abandoned this distinction. The languages of the Tamil-Kodagu group have formed a new exclusive 'we' by adding the plural suffix (cf. Tamil \"n\u0101m\" 'we (incl.)', \"n\u0101\u1e45-ka\u1e37\" 'we (excl.)').\nThe demonstrative pronouns also serve as personal pronouns of the 3rd person. They consist of an initial vowel expressing the distance and a suffix expressing number and gender. There are three levels of distance: the far distance is formed with the initial vowel *a-, the middle distance with *u- and the near distance with *i-. The same deictic elements also occur in local ('here', 'there') and temporal adverbs ('now', 'then'). The original threefold distinction of the distance (e.g. Kota \"avn\" 'he, that one', \"\u016bn\" 'he, this one', \"ivn\" 'he, this one') has only survived in a few languages spoken today, the yonder distance u- has mostly become obsolete instead a- and i- are used. Interrogative pronouns are formed analogously to the demonstrative pronouns and are characterized by the initial syllable *ya- (e.g. Kota \"evn\" 'which').\nTamil-Telugu made another word \"*\u00f1\u0101n\" for the 1SG pronoun back formed from 1P inclusive \"*\u00f1\u0101m\", in parallel to *y\u0101n; some languages like Tamil retain both forms, \"y\u0101\u1e49, n\u0101\u1e49\".\nVerbal morphology.\nThe Dravidian verb is formed by adding tense, mood and personal suffixes to the root of the word. Thus the Tamil word \"varuki\u1e5f\u0113\u1e49\" 'I come' is composed of the verb stem \"varu-\", the present suffix \"-ki\u1e5f\" and the suffix of the 1st person singular \"-\u0113\u1e49\".\nIn Proto-Dravidian there are only two tenses, past and not past, while many daughter languages have developed a more complex tense system.\nThe negation is expressed synthetically by a special negative verb form (cf. Konda \"kitan\" 'he made', \"ki\u0294etan\" 'he did not').\nThe verb stem can be modified by stem-forming suffixes in many Dravidian languages. Thus Malto derives from the stem \"nud-\" 'to hide' the reflexive verb stem \"nud\u0263r-\" 'to hide'.\nInfinite verb forms depend on either a following verb or a following noun. They serve to form more complex syntactic constructions.\nVerbal compounds can be formed in Dravidian, for example the Tamil \"kon\u1e6duvara\" 'to bring' is composed of an infinite form of the verb \"ko\u1e37\u1e37a\" 'to hold' and the verb \"vara\" 'to come'.\nSyntax.\nCharacteristic of the Dravidian languages is a fixed subject\u2013object\u2013verb word order (SOV). Accordingly, the subject comes first in the sentence (it can at most be preceded by circumstantial determinations of time and place) and the predicate always at the end of the sentence. As is characteristic of SOV languages, in the Dravidian languages, attributes always come before their noun, subordinate clauses before main clauses, main verbs before auxiliary verbs, and postpositions are used instead of prepositions. Only in the North Dravidian languages has the rigid SOV word order been relaxed.\nA simple sentence consists of a subject and a predicate, which can be either a verb or a noun. There is no copula in Dravidian. The subject is usually in the nominative case, but in many Dravidian languages, in a sentence expressing a feeling, perception or possession, the subject is also in the dative case. In all Dravidian languages except Malayalam, a verbal predicate agrees with a nominative subject. Kui and Kuwi developed a system of congruence between object and verb. In some Dravidian languages (Old Tamil, Gondi) even a nominal predicate takes personal endings. Examples of simple sentences from Tamil:\nComplex sentences consist of a main clause and one or more subordinate clauses. In general, a sentence can contain only one finite verb. The Dravidian languages have no conjunctions; subordinate clauses are formed just like parataxes by infinite verb forms. These include the infinitive, the verbal participle, which expresses a sequence of actions, and the conditional, which expresses a conditionality. Relative clauses correspond to constructions with the so-called adnominal participles. Examples from Tamil:\nThese constructions are not possible for subordinate clauses with a nominal predicate, since no infinite forms can be formed for a noun. Here one gets by with the so-called quotative verb (usually an infinite form of 'to say'), through which the nominal subordinate clause is embedded in the sentence structure. Example from Tamil:\nVocabulary.\nWord roots seem to have been monosyllabic in Proto-Dravidian as a rule. Proto-Dravidian words could be simple, derived, or compound. Iterative compounds could be formed by doubling a word, cf. Tamil \"avar\" \"he\" and \"avaravar\" \"everyone\" or \"vantu\" \"coming\" and \"vantu vantu\" \"always coming\". A special form of reduplicated compounds are the so-called echo words, in which the first syllable of the second word is replaced by \"ki\", cf. Tamil \"pustakam\" \"book\" and \"pustakam-kistakam\" \"books and the like\".\nToday's Dravidian languages have, in addition to the inherited Dravidian vocabulary, a large number of words from Sanskrit or later Indo-Aryan languages. In Tamil, they make up a relatively small proportion, not least because of targeted linguistic puristic tendencies in the early 20th century, while in Telugu and Malayalam the number of Indo-Aryan loanwords is large. In Brahui, which was strongly influenced by its neighboring languages due to its distance from the other Dravidian languages, only a tenth of the vocabulary is of Dravidian origin. [16] More recently, like all the languages of India, the Dravidian languages also have words borrowed from English on a large scale; less numerous are the loanwords from Portuguese.\nDravidian words that have found their way into English are \"orange\" (via Sanskrit \"n\u0101ra\u1e45ga\", cf. Tamil \"n\u0101ra\u1e45k\u0430\u0304y\" &lt; \"n\u0101ram-k\u0430\u0304y\"), \"catamaran\" (Tamil \"ka\u1e6d\u1e6dumaram\" \"[boat made of] bound logs\"), \"mango\" (Tamil \"m\u0101\u1e45k\u0101y\", Malayalam \"m\u0101\u1e45\u1e45a\", via Portuguese \"manga\"), \"mongoose\" (Telugu \"mu\u1e45gisa\", Kannada \"mu\u1e45gisi\") and \"curry\" (Tamil \"ka\u1e5fi\").\nNumerals.\nThe numerals from 1 to 10 in various Dravidian and Indo-Iranian languages (here exemplified by Indo-Aryan language Sanskrit and Iranian language Persian).\nLiterature.\nFour Dravidian languages, viz. Tamil, Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam, have lengthy literary traditions. Literature in Tulu and Kodava is more recent. Recently old literature in Gondi has been discovered as well.\nThe earliest known Dravidian inscriptions are 76 Old Tamil inscriptions on cave walls in Madurai and Tirunelveli districts in Tamil Nadu, dating from the 2nd century BCE. These inscriptions are written in a variant of the Brahmi script called Tamil Brahmi. In 2019, the Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department released a report on excavations at Keeladi, near Madurai, Tamil Nadu, including a description of potsherds dated to the 6th century BCE inscribed with personal names in the Tamil-Brahmi script. However, the report lacks the detail of a full archaeological study, and other archaeologists have disputed whether the oldest dates obtained for the site can be assigned to these potsherds. The earliest long text in Old Tamil is the \"Tolk\u0101ppiyam\", a work on Tamil grammar and poetics preserved in a 5th-century CE redaction, whose oldest layers could date from the late 2nd century or 1st century BCE.\nKannada's earliest known inscription is the lion balustrade (\"Simhakatanjana\") inscription excavated at the Pranaveshwara temple complex at Talagunda near Shiralakoppa of Shivamogga district, dated to 370 CE which replaced the Halmidi inscription in Hassan district (450 CE). A 9th-century treatise on poetics, the \"Kavirajamarga\", is the first known literary work. The earliest Telugu inscription, from Erragudipadu in Kadapa district, is dated 575. The first literary work is an 11th-century translation of part of the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\". The earliest Malayalam text is the Vazhappally copper plate (9th century). The first literary work is \"R\u0101macaritam\" (12th century)."}
{"id": "7923", "revid": "30547507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7923", "title": "Dracula", "text": "Dracula is a 1897 Gothic horror novel by Irish author Bram Stoker. An epistolary novel, the narrative is related through letters, diary entries, and newspaper articles. It has no single protagonist and opens with solicitor Jonathan Harker taking a business trip to stay at the castle of a Transylvanian nobleman, Count Dracula. Harker escapes the castle after discovering that Dracula is a vampire, and the Count moves to England and plagues the seaside town of Whitby. A small group, led by Abraham Van Helsing, investigate and hunt the vampire.\n\"Dracula\" was mostly written in the 1890s. Stoker produced over a hundred pages of notes for the novel, drawing extensively from Transylvanian folklore and history. Some scholars have suggested that the character of Dracula was inspired by historical figures like the Wallachian prince Vlad the Impaler or the Countess Elizabeth B\u00e1thory, but there is widespread disagreement. Stoker's notes mention neither figure. He found the name \"Dracula\" in Whitby's public library while on holiday, thinking it meant \"devil\" in Romanian.\nFollowing publication on 26 May 1897, \"Dracula\" was received as very frightening by positive and negative reviewers. Comparisons were made to other Gothic fiction, with many noting its structural similarity to Wilkie Collins' \"The Woman in White\" (1859). In the 20th century, \"Dracula\" became regarded as a seminal piece of Gothic fiction. Scholars explore the novel within the historical context of the Victorian era and discuss its portrayal of gender, sexuality, religion, and race.\n\"Dracula\" is one of the most famous pieces of English literature. The book's characters have entered popular culture as archetypal versions of their characters: Count Dracula as the quintessential vampire, and Van Helsing as the most iconic vampire hunter. The novel, which is in the public domain, has been adapted for film over 30 times, and its characters have made numerous appearances in virtually all forms of media.\nPlot.\nJonathan Harker, a newly qualified English solicitor, visits Count Dracula at his castle in the Carpathian Mountains to help the Count purchase a house near London. Ignoring the Count's warning, Harker wanders the castle at night and encounters three vampire women; Dracula rescues Harker, and gives the women a small child bound inside a bag. Harker awakens in bed; soon after, Dracula leaves the castle, abandoning him to the women. Harker escapes and ends up delirious in a Budapest hospital. Dracula takes a ship called the \"Demeter\" for England with boxes of earth from his castle. The captain's log narrates the crew's disappearance until he alone remains, bound to the helm to maintain course. An animal resembling a large dog is seen leaping ashore when the ship runs aground at Whitby.\nLucy Westenra's letter to her best friend, Harker's fianc\u00e9e Mina Murray, describes her marriage proposals from Dr. John Seward, Quincey Morris, and Arthur Holmwood. Lucy accepts Holmwood's, but all remain friends. Mina joins Lucy on holiday in Whitby. Lucy begins to sleepwalk. After Dracula's ship lands in Whitby, he stalks Lucy. Mina receives a letter about her missing fianc\u00e9's illness, and goes to Budapest to nurse him. Lucy becomes very ill. Seward's old teacher, Professor Abraham Van Helsing, determines the nature of Lucy's condition, but refuses to disclose it. He diagnoses her with acute blood-loss. Van Helsing places garlic flowers around her room and makes her a necklace of them. Lucy's mother removes the garlic flowers, not knowing they repel vampires. While Seward and Van Helsing are absent, Lucy and her mother are terrified by a wolf and Mrs. Westenra dies of a heart attack; Lucy dies shortly thereafter. After her burial, newspapers report children being stalked in the night by a \"bloofer lady\" (beautiful lady), and Van Helsing deduces it is Lucy. The four go to her tomb and see that she is a vampire. They stake her heart, behead her, and fill her mouth with garlic. Jonathan Harker and his now-wife Mina return and join the campaign against Dracula.\nEveryone stays at Dr. Seward's asylum as the men begin to hunt Dracula. Van Helsing finally reveals that vampires can only rest on earth from their homeland. Dracula communicates with Seward's patient, Renfield, an insane man who eats vermin to absorb their life force. After Dracula learns of the group's plot against him, he uses Renfield to enter the asylum. He secretly attacks Mina three times, drinking her blood each time and forcing Mina to drink his blood on the final visit. She is cursed to become a vampire after her death unless Dracula is killed. As the men find Dracula's properties, they discover many earth boxes within. The vampire hunters open each of the boxes and seal wafers of sacramental bread inside them, rendering them useless to Dracula. The group fail to trap the Count in his Piccadilly house, and learn that Dracula is fleeing to his castle in Transylvania with his last box. Using hypnosis, Van Helsing exploits Mina's faint psychic connection to Dracula to track his movements and they pursue, guided by Mina.\nIn Galatz, Romania, the hunters split up. Van Helsing and Mina go to Dracula's castle, where the professor destroys the vampire women. Jonathan Harker and Arthur Holmwood follow Dracula's boat on the river, while Quincey Morris and John Seward parallel them on land. After Dracula's box is finally loaded onto a wagon by Romani men, the hunters converge and attack it. After routing the Romani, Harker decapitates Dracula as Quincey stabs him in the heart. Dracula crumbles to dust, freeing Mina from her vampiric curse. Quincey is mortally wounded in the fight against the Romani. He dies from his wounds, at peace with the knowledge that Mina is saved. A note by Jonathan Harker seven years later states that the Harkers have a son, named Quincey.\nBackground.\nAuthor.\nAs the acting manager of the Lyceum Theatre in London, Bram Stoker was a recognisable figure: he would greet evening guests, and served as assistant to the stage actor Henry Irving. In a letter to Walt Whitman, Stoker described his own temperament as \"secretive to the world\", but he nonetheless led a relatively public life. Stoker supplemented his income from the theatre by writing romance and sensation novels, and had published 18 books by his death in 1912. \"Dracula\" was Stoker's seventh published book, following \"The Shoulder of Shasta\" (1895) and preceding \"Miss Betty\" (1898). Hall Caine, a close friend of Stoker's, wrote an obituary for him in \"The Daily Telegraph\", saying that\u2014besides his biography on Irving\u2014Stoker wrote only \"to sell\" and \"had no higher aims\".\nInfluences.\nMany figures have been suggested as inspirations for Count Dracula, but there is no consensus. In his 1962 biography of Stoker, Harry Ludlam suggested that \u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry, a professor at the University of Budapest, supplied Stoker with information about Vlad Dr\u0103culea, commonly known as Vlad the Impaler. Professors Raymond T. McNally and Radu Florescu popularised the idea in their 1972 book, \"In Search of Dracula\". Benjamin H. LeBlanc writes that there a reference within the text to V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry, an \"Arminius, of Buda-Pesh University\", who is familiar with the historical Vlad III and is a friend of Abraham Van Helsing, but an investigation by McNally and Florescu found nothing about \"Vlad, Dracula, or vampires\" within V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry's published papers, nor in Stoker's notes about his meeting with V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry. Academic and \"Dracula\" scholar Elizabeth Miller calls the link to Vlad III \"tenuous\", indicating that Stoker incorporated a large amount of \"insignificant detail\" from his research, and rhetorically asking why he would omit Vlad III's infamous cruelty.\nRaymond McNally's \"Dracula Was A Woman\" (1983) suggests another historical figure as an inspiration: Elizabeth B\u00e1thory. McNally argues that the imagery of \"Dracula\" has analogues in B\u00e1thory's described crimes, such as the use of a cage resembling an iron maiden. Gothic critic and lecturer Marie Mulvey-Roberts writes that vampires were traditionally depicted as \"mouldering revenants, who dragged themselves around graveyards\", but\u2014like B\u00e1thory\u2014Dracula uses blood to restore his youth. Recent scholarship has questioned whether B\u00e1thory's crimes were exaggerated by her political opponents, with others noting that very little is concretely known about her life. A book that Stoker used for research, \"The Book of Were-Wolves\", does have some information on B\u00e1thory, but Miller writes that he never took notes on anything from the short section devoted to her. In a facsimile edition of Bram Stoker's original notes for the book, Miller and her co-author Robert Eighteen-Bisang say in a footnote that there is no evidence she inspired Stoker. In 2000, Miller's book-length study, \"Dracula: Sense and Nonsense\", was said by academic Noel Chevalier to correct \"not only leading \"Dracula\" scholars, but non-specialists and popular film and television documentaries\".\nAside from the historical, Count Dracula also has literary progenitors. Academic Elizabeth Signorotti argues that \"Dracula\" is a response to the lesbian vampire of Sheridan Le Fanu's \"Carmilla\" (1872), \"correcting\" its emphasis on female desire. Bram Stoker's great-nephew, broadcaster Daniel Farson, wrote a biography of the author; in it, he doubts that Stoker was aware of the lesbian elements of \"Carmilla\", but nonetheless notes that it influenced him profoundly. Farson writes that an inscription upon a tomb in \"Dracula\" is a direct allusion to \"Carmilla\". Scholar Alison Milbank observes that as Dracula can transform into a dog, Carmilla can become a cat. According to author Patrick McGrath, \"traces of \"Carmilla\"\" can be found in the three female vampires residing in Dracula castle. A short story written by Stoker and published after his death, \"Dracula's Guest\", has been seen as evidence of \"Carmilla\" influence. According to Milbank, the story was a deleted first chapter from early in the original manuscript, and replicates \"Carmilla\" setting of Styria instead of Transylvania.\nTextual history.\nComposition.\nPrior to writing the novel, Stoker researched extensively, assembling over 100 pages of notes, including chapter summaries and plot outlines. The notes were sold by Bram Stoker's widow, Florence, in 1913, to a New York book dealer for \u00a32.2s, (). Following that, the notes became the property of Charles Scribner's Sons, and then disappeared until they were bought by the Rosenbach Museum and Library in Philadelphia in 1970. H. P. Lovecraft wrote that he knew \"an old lady\" who was approached to revise the original manuscript, but that Stoker found her too expensive. Stoker's first biographer, Harry Ludlam, wrote in 1962 that writing commenced on \"Dracula\" around 1895 or 1896. Following the rediscovery of Stoker's notes in 1972 by Raymond T. McNally and Radu Florescu, the two dated the writing of \"Dracula\" to between 1895 and 1897. Later scholarship has questioned these sets of dates. In the first extensive study of the notes, Joseph S. Bierman writes that the earliest date within them is 8 March 1890, for an outline of a chapter that \"differs from the final version in only a few details\". According to Bierman, Stoker always intended to write an epistolary novel, but originally set it in Styria instead of Transylvania; this iteration did not explicitly use the word \"vampire\".\nHarry Ludlam, Bram's first biographer, wrote that the book came to life in August 1895 on the author's third visit to Cruden Bay in Scotland. \u2018And here one day, to the sound of the sea on the Scottish shore, Count Dracula made his entry.\u2019 The Stoker stayed in the Kilmarnock Arms Hotel, signing the guest book, which still survives.\nStoker's notes illuminate much about earlier iterations of the novel. For instance, they indicate that the novel's vampire was intended to be a Count, even before he was given the name \"Dracula\". Stoker likely found the name \"Dracula\" in Whitby's public library while holidaying there with his wife and son in 1880. On the name, Stoker wrote: \"Dracula means devil. Wallachians were accustomed to give it as a surname to any person who rendered himself conspicuous by courage, cruel actions or cunning\". Stoker's initial plans for \"Dracula\" markedly differ from the final novel. Had Stoker completed his original plans, a German professor called Max Windshoeffel \"would have confronted Count Wampyr from Styria\", and one of the Crew of Light would have been slain by a werewolf. Stoker's earliest notes indicate that \"Dracula\" might have originally been intended to be a detective story, with a detective called Cotford and a psychical investigator called Singleton.\nPublication.\n\"Dracula\" was published in London in May 1897 by Archibald Constable and Company. It cost 6 shillings, and was bound in yellow cloth and titled in red letters. In 2002, Barbara Belford, a biographer, wrote that the novel looked \"shabby\", perhaps because the title had been changed at a late stage. Although contracts were typically signed at least 6 months ahead of publication, \"Dracula\" was unusually signed only 6 days prior to publication. For the first thousand sales of the novel, Stoker earned no royalties. Following serialisation by American newspapers, Doubleday &amp; McClure published an American edition in 1899. In the 1930s when Universal Studios purchased the rights to make a film version, it was discovered that Stoker had not fully complied with US copyright law, placing the novel into the public domain. The novelist was required to purchase the copyright and register two copies, but he registered only one. Stoker's mother, Charlotte Stoker, enthused about the novel to Stoker, predicting it would bring him immense financial success. She was wrong; the novel, although reviewed well, did not make Stoker much money and did not cement his critical legacy until after his death. Since its publication, \"Dracula\" has never been out of print.\nIn 1901, Valdimar \u00c1smundsson translated the novel into Icelandic under the title \"Makt Myrkranna\" (\"Powers of Darkness\"); Stoker provided a preface in which he said the novel was a true story, but with the names of people and places changed \"for obvious reasons\". Scholars had been aware of the translation's existence since the 1980s because of Stoker's preface, but none had translated it back into English. \"Makt Myrkranna\" differs significantly from Stoker's novel: character names were changed, the length was abridged, and it was more overtly sexual. Dutch scholar Hans Corneel de Roos compared the translation favourably to Stoker's, describing it as concise and punchy compared to Stoker's original.\nContext and interpretation.\nSexuality.\nSexuality and seduction are two of the novel's most frequently discussed themes, especially as it relates to the corruption of English womanhood. Sexually charged analyses of \"Dracula\" are so frequent that a cottage industry has developed around the topic. Modern critical writings about vampirism widely acknowledge its link to sex and sexuality. Critics have variously linked the novel's sexual themes to homoerotic letters Stoker wrote to Walt Whitman, his close friendship with Oscar Wilde, his intensely emotional relationship with Irving, and contemporary rumours of Stoker's almost sexless marriage. David J. Skal acknowledged the letters' subtext but cautioned against applying anachronistic modern sexual labels to Stoker.\nCritics regularly discuss the novel's representation of transgressive sexuality. Christopher Craft argues that the primary threat posed by Count Dracula is that he will \"seduce, penetrate, [and] drain another male\". Harker's excitement about being penetrated by the vampire women inverts Victorian gender roles: by succumbing, Harker assumes the passive feminine role while the vampires assume the active masculinised role. Craft also reads the scene as a proxy for \"an implicitly homoerotic desire\". John Allen Stevenson states that Dracula's attack on Mina is evocative of fellatio, and points to Lucy's transformation into a sexually aggressive penetrator who drains \"vital fluid\". American professor Carol Senf writes that Lucy's sexual awakening, and thus the subsequent reversal of her sexual role, is what Abraham Van Helsing actually considers a threat.\nGender.\nCritics discuss the novel in relation to the New Woman phenomenon\u2014a late Victorian term describing an emerging class of intellectual women with greater social and economic control over their lives. Literary critic Elaine Showalter suggests that Lucy and Mina represent different sides of the New Woman. Lucy may represent the New Woman's \"sexual daring\", as she wonders why a woman cannot marry three men who all desire her, while Mina represents the New Woman's intellect, citing her occupation as a an assistant schoolmistress and her knowledge of shorthand. Senf regards Stoker as ambivalent towards the New Woman phenomenon: of the novel's five vampires, four are \"wildly erotic\" women driven solely by blood thirst. Senf expands that Mina is the antithesis of the other female characters, playing a singularly important role in Dracula's defeat. Several critics describe the battle against Dracula as a fight for control over women's bodies.\nRace.\n\"Dracula\", and specifically the Count's migration to Victorian England, is frequently read as emblematic of invasion literature, and a projection of fears about racial pollution. Stephen Arata describes the novel's cultural context of mounting anxiety in Britain over the decline of the British Empire, the rise of other world powers, and a \"growing domestic unease\" over the morality of imperial colonisation. Arata regards the novel as an instance of \"reverse colonisation\": fear of other races invading England and weakening its racial purity. Patricia McKee writes that Dracula represents a negation of white culture while Mina Harper represents \"pure whiteness\". Dracula can be said to both kill white bodies and turn them into the racial Other in death. Some critics connect the racialisation of Dracula to his depiction as a degenerate criminal.\nCritics frequently identify antisemitic themes and imagery in the novel. Between 1891 and 1900, the number of Jews living in England increased sixfold, mainly due to antisemitic legislation and pogroms in eastern Europe. Examples cited by Jack Halberstam of antisemitic connections include Dracula's appearance, wealth, parasitic bloodlust, and \"lack of allegiance\" to one country. Dracula's appearance may resembles some other cultural depictions of Jews, such as Fagin in Charles Dickens's \"Oliver Twist\" (1838), and Svengali of George du Maurier's \"Trilby\" (1895). Jewish people were frequently described as parasites in Victorian literature; Halberstam highlights fears that Jews would spread diseases of the blood, and one journalist's description of Jews as \"Yiddish bloodsuckers\". Daniel Renshaw writes that Dracula is not himself Jewish and that the novel represents a general suspicion of all foreigners. He argues that any antisemitism is \"semi-subliminal\" and mainly reflects the 19th-century antisemitic conception of Jewish people.\nThe novel's depiction of Slovaks and Romani people has attracted limited scholarly attention. In the novel, Harker describes the Slovaks as \"barbarians\" and their boats as \"primitive\", reflecting his imperialistic condescension towards other cultures. Peter Arnds writes that the Count's control over the Romani and his abduction of young children evoke folk superstitions about Romani people stealing children, and that his ability to transform into a wolf is related to xenophobic beliefs about the Romani as animalistic. Croley argues that Dracula's association with the Romani made him suspect in the eyes of Victorian England, where they were stigmatised owing to beliefs that they ate \"unclean meat\" and lived among animals.\nReligion, superstition and science.\n\"Dracula\" is saturated with religious imagery. Christopher Herbert regards the novel as a parable about conflict with an enemy who opposes Christ and Christianity. Scholars discuss the novel's depiction of religion in relation to late Victorian anxieties about the threat which secularism, scientific rationalism and the occult posed to Christian beliefs and morality. Stoker himself had a lifelong interest in supernatural inquiry, and Herbert writes that he mixes the supernatural and superstitious beliefs with religious elements, resulting in metaphors about moral uncleanness becoming literal elements of the text's \"occult reality\". Herbert also draws a parallel between the vampire's drinking of blood and the blood of Christ in Christian ritual and imagery. \nThe vampire hunters use many weapons\u2014including Christian practices and symbols (prayer, crucifixes and consecrated hosts), folkloric practices (garlic, staking and decapitation) and contemporary technology (typewriters, phonographs, telegrams, blood transfusions and Winchester rifles)\u2014in their battle against Dracula. Sanders argues that Stoker presents Christianity as a religion that can be instrumentalised and incorporated into scientific knowledge. Herbert describes Van Helsing's \"Christian purification\" of Lucy as punitively addressing her promiscuity, and the resulting framing of Christianity as a means towards the \"eradication of deviancy\".\nDisease.\nSome scholars contend that the novel's depiction of vampirism symbolises Victorian anxieties about disease. Martin Willis argues that vampirism represents both an initial infection and resulting illness. Herbert relates the portrayal of disease to social degeneration, highlighting Victorian-era beliefs that poor moral character was transmissible like a pathogen. Mathias Clasen draws parallels between vampirism and sexually transmitted diseases, specifically syphilis. Stoker's grand-nephew noted that there is some evidence Stoker died from syphilis, and that the disease's slow progression means he could have contracted it prior to writing \"Dracula\". Brian Aldiss writes that Count Dracula represents the disease itself, while other characters represent particular aspects of it, such as Renfield's madness resembling the effects of tertiary syphilis.\nStyle.\nNarrative.\nAs an epistolary novel, \"Dracula\" is narrated through a series of documents. The novel's first four chapters are related as the journals of Jonathan Harker. Scholar David Seed notes that Harker's accounts function as an attempt to translocate the \"strange\" events of his visit to Dracula's castle into the nineteenth-century tradition of travelogue writing. For Harker's description of the Slovaks, Stoker drew heavily from a travel memoir by a British major. John Seward, Mina Murray and Jonathan Harker all keep a crystalline account of the period as an act of self-preservation; David Seed notes that Harker's narrative is written in shorthand to remain inscrutable to the Count, protecting his own identity, which Dracula threatens to destroy. Harker's journal, for example, embodies the only advantage during his stay at Dracula's castle: that he knows more than the Count thinks he does. The novel's disparate accounts approach a kind of narrative unity as the narrative unfolds. In the novel's first half, each narrator has a strongly characterised narrative voice, with Lucy's showing her verbosity, Seward's businesslike formality, and Harker's excessive politeness. These narrative styles also highlight the power struggle between vampire and his hunters; the increasing prominence of Van Helsing's broken English as Dracula gathers power represents the entrance of the foreigner into Victorian society.\nGenre.\n\"Dracula\" is a common reference text in discussions of Gothic fiction. Jerrold E. Hogle notes Gothic fiction's tendency to blur boundaries, pointing to sexual orientation, race, class, and even species. Relating this to \"Dracula\", he highlights that the Count \"can disgorge blood from his breasts\" in addition to his teeth; that he is attracted to both Jonathan Harker and Mina Murray; appears both racially western and eastern; and how he is an aristocrat able to mingle with homeless vagrants. Stoker drew extensively from folklore in crafting Count Dracula, but many of the Count's physical attributes were typical of Gothic villains during Stoker's lifetime. In particular, his hooked nose, pale complexion, large moustache and thick eyebrows were likely inspired by the villains of Gothic fiction. Likewise, Stoker's selection of Transylvania has roots in the Gothic. Writers of the mode were drawn to Eastern Europe as a setting because travelogues presented it as a land of primitive superstitions. \"Dracula\" deviates from Gothic tales before it by firmly establishing its time\u2014that being the modern era. The novel is an example of the Urban Gothic subgenre.\n\"Dracula\" became the subject of critical interest into Irish fiction during the early 1990s. \"Dracula\" is set largely in England, but Stoker was born in Ireland, which was at that time part of the British Empire, and lived there for the first 30 years of his life. As a result, a significant body of writing exists on \"Dracula\", Ireland, England, and colonialism. Calvin W. Keogh writes that Harker's voyage into Eastern Europe \"bears comparison with the Celtic fringe to the west\", highlighting them both as \"othered\" spaces. Keogh notes that the Eastern Question has been both symbolically and historically associated with the Irish question. In this reading, Transylvania functions as a stand-in for Ireland. Several critics have described Count Dracula as an Anglo-Irish landlord, or discussed Dracula in relation to the Irish folkloric revenant Abhartach.\nReception.\nUpon publication, \"Dracula\" was well received. Reviewers frequently compared the novel to other Gothic writers, and mentions of novelist Wilkie Collins and \"The Woman in White\" (1859) were especially common because of similarities in structure and style. A review appearing in \"The Bookseller\" notes that the novel could almost have been written by Collins, and an anonymous review in \"Saturday Review of Politics, Literature, Science and Art\" wrote that \"Dracula\" improved upon the style of Gothic pioneer Ann Radcliffe. Another anonymous writer described Stoker as \"the Edgar Allan Poe of the nineties\". Other favourable comparisons to other Gothic novelists include the Bront\u00eb sisters and Mary Shelley.\nMany of these early reviews were charmed by Stoker's unique treatment of the vampire myth. One called it the best vampire story ever written. \"The Daily Telegraph\" reviewer noted that while earlier Gothic works, like \"The Castle of Otranto\", had kept the supernatural far away from the novelists' home countries, \"Dracula\" horrors occurred both in foreign lands\u2014in the far-away Carpathian Mountains\u2014and at home, in Whitby and Hampstead Heath. An Australian paper, \"The Advertiser\", regarded the novel as simultaneously sensational and domestic. One reviewer praised the \"considerable power\" of Stoker's prose and describing it as impressionistic. They were less fond of the parts set in England, finding the vampire suited better to tales set far away from home. The British magazine \"Vanity Fair\" noted that the novel was, at times, unintentionally funny, pointing to Dracula's disdain for garlic.\n\"Dracula\" was widely considered to be frightening. A review appearing in \"The Manchester Guardian\" in 1897 praised its capacity to entertain, but concluded that Stoker erred in including so much horror. Likewise, \"Vanity Fair\" opined that the novel was \"praiseworthy\" and absorbing, but could not recommend it to those who were not \"strong\". Stoker's prose was commended as effective in sustaining the novel's horror by many publications. A reviewer for the \"San Francisco Wave\" called the novel a \"literary failure\"; they elaborated that coupling vampires with frightening imagery, such as insane asylums and \"unnatural appetites\", made the horror too overt, and that other works in the genre, such as \"The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\", had more restraint.\nModern critics frequently write that \"Dracula\" had a mixed critical reception upon publication. Carol Margaret Davison, for example, notes an \"uneven\" response from critics contemporary to Stoker. John Edgar Browning, a scholar whose research focuses on \"Dracula\" and literary vampires, conducted a review of the novel's early criticism in 2012 and determined that \"Dracula\" had been \"a critically acclaimed novel\". Browning writes that the misconception of \"Dracula\" mixed reception stems from a low sample size. Of 91 contemporary reviews, Browning identified 10 as \"generally positive\"; 4 as \"mixed\" in their assessment; 3 as \"wholly or mostly negative\"; and the rest as positive and possessing no negative reservations. Among the positive reviews, Browning writes that 36 were unreserved in their praise, including publications like \"The Daily Mail\", \"The Daily Telegraph\", and \"Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper\". Other critical works have rejected the narrative of \"Dracula\" mixed response. Raymond T. McNally and Radu Florescu's \"In Search of Dracula\" mentions the novel's \"immediate success\". Other works about \"Dracula\", coincidentally also published in 1972, concur; Gabriel Ronay says the novel was \"recognised by fans and critics alike as a horror writer's stroke of genius\", and Anthony Masters mentions the novel's \"enormous popular appeal\". Since the 1970s, \"Dracula\" has been the subject of significant academic interest, evidenced by its own peer-reviewed journal and the numerous books and articles discussing the novel.\nLegacy.\nAdaptations.\nThe story of \"Dracula\" has been the basis for numerous films and plays. Stoker himself wrote the first theatrical adaptation, which was presented at the Lyceum Theatre on 18 May 1897 under the title \"Dracula, or The Undead\" shortly before the novel's publication and performed only once, in order to establish his own copyright for such adaptations. Although the manuscript was believed lost, the British Library possesses a copy. It consists of extracts from the novel's galley proof with Stoker's own handwriting providing direction and dialogue attribution.\nThe first film to feature Count Dracula was K\u00e1roly Lajthay's \"Drakula hal\u00e1la\" (), a Hungarian silent film which allegedly premiered in 1921, though this release date has been questioned by some scholars. Very little of the film has survived, and David J. Skal notes that the cover artist for the 1926 Hungarian edition of the novel was more influenced by the second adaptation of \"Dracula\", F. W. Murnau's \"Nosferatu\". Critic Wayne E. Hensley writes that the narrative of \"Nosferatu\" differs significantly from the novel, but that characters have clear counterparts. Bram Stoker's widow, Florence, initiated legal action against the studio behind \"Nosferatu\", Prana. The legal case lasted two or three years, and in May 1924, Prana agreed to destroy all copies of the film.\nVisual representations of the Count have changed significantly over time. Early treatments of Dracula's appearance were established by theatrical productions in London and New York. Later prominent portrayals of the character by B\u00e9la Lugosi (in a 1931 adaptation) and Christopher Lee (firstly in the 1958 film and later its sequels) built upon earlier versions. Chiefly, Dracula's early visual style involved a black-red colour scheme and slicked back hair. Lee's portrayal was overtly sexual, and also popularised fangs on screen. Gary Oldman's portrayal in \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" (1992), directed by Francis Ford Coppola and costumed by Eiko Ishioka, established a new default look for the character\u2014a Romanian accent and long hair. The assortment of adaptations feature many different dispositions and characteristics of the Count.\n\"Dracula\" has been adapted a large number of times across virtually all forms of media. John Edgar Browning and Caroline Joan S. Picart write that the novel and its characters have been adapted for film, television, video games and animation over 700 times, with nearly 1000 additional appearances in comic books and on the stage. Roberto Fern\u00e1ndez Retamar deemed Count Dracula\u2014along with characters such as Frankenstein's monster, Mickey Mouse and Superman\u2014to be a part of the \"hegemonic Anglo-Saxon world['s] cinematic fodder\". Across the world, completed new adaptations can be produced as often as every week.\nInfluence.\n\"Dracula\" is one of the most famous and influential pieces of English literature. It was not the first novel to depict vampires, but dominates both popular and scholarly treatments of vampire fiction. Count Dracula is the first character to come to mind when people discuss vampires. \"Dracula\" succeeded by drawing together folklore, legend, vampire fiction and the conventions of the Gothic novel. Wendy Doniger described the novel as vampire literature's \"centrepiece, rendering all other vampires BS or AS\". It profoundly shaped the popular understanding of how vampires function, including their strengths, weaknesses, and other characteristics. Bats had been associated with vampires before \"Dracula\" as a result of the vampire bat's existence\u2014for example, \"Varney the Vampire\" (1847) included an image of a bat on its cover illustration. But Stoker deepened the association by making Dracula able to transform into one. That was, in turn, quickly taken up by film studios looking for opportunities to use special effects. Patrick McGrath notes that many of the Count's characteristics have been adopted by artists succeeding Stoker in depicting vampires, turning those fixtures into clich\u00e9s. Aside from the Count's ability to transform, McGrath specifically highlights his hatred of garlic, sunlight, and crucifixes. William Hughes writes critically of the Count's cultural omnipresence, noting that the character of Dracula has \"seriously inhibited\" discussions of the undead in Gothic fiction.\nAdaptations of the novel and its characters have contributed to its enduring popularity. Even within academic discussions, the boundaries between Stoker's novel and the character's adaptation across a range of media have effectively been blurred. Stoker's failure to comply with United States copyright law may have contributed to its enduring status because writers and producers did not need to pay a licence fee to use the character."}
{"id": "7925", "revid": "36510957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7925", "title": "David Hume", "text": "David Hume (; born David Home; \u2013 25 August 1776) was a Scottish philosopher, historian, economist, and essayist who was best known for his highly influential system of empiricism, philosophical scepticism and metaphysical naturalism. Beginning with \"A Treatise of Human Nature\" (1739\u201340), Hume strove to create a naturalistic science of man that examined the psychological basis of human nature. Hume followed John Locke in rejecting the existence of innate ideas, concluding that all human knowledge derives solely from experience. This places him with Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and George Berkeley as an empiricist.\nHume argued that inductive reasoning and belief in causality cannot be justified rationally; instead, they result from custom and mental habit. We never actually perceive that one event causes another but only experience the \"constant conjunction\" of events. This problem of induction means that to draw any causal inferences from past experience, it is necessary to presuppose that the future will resemble the past; this metaphysical presupposition cannot itself be grounded in prior experience.\nAn opponent of philosophical rationalists, Hume held that passions rather than reason govern human behaviour, famously proclaiming that \"Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions.\" Hume was also a sentimentalist who held that ethics are based on emotion or sentiment rather than abstract moral principle. He maintained an early commitment to naturalistic explanations of moral phenomena and is usually accepted by historians of European philosophy to have first clearly expounded the is\u2013ought problem, or the idea that a statement of fact alone can never give rise to a normative conclusion of what \"ought\" to be done.\nHume denied that humans have an actual conception of the self, positing that we experience only a bundle of sensations, and that the self is nothing more than this bundle of perceptions connected by an association of ideas. Hume's compatibilist theory of free will takes causal determinism as fully compatible with human freedom. His philosophy of religion, including his rejection of miracles, and of the argument from design for God's existence, were especially controversial for their time. Hume left a legacy that affected utilitarianism, logical positivism, the philosophy of science, early analytic philosophy, cognitive science, theology, and many other fields and thinkers. Immanuel Kant credited Hume as the inspiration that had awakened him from his \"dogmatic slumbers.\"\nEarly life.\nHume was born on 26 April 1711, as David Home, in a tenement on the north side of Edinburgh's Lawnmarket. He was the second of two sons born to Catherine Home (n\u00e9e Falconer), daughter of Sir David Falconer of Newton, Midlothian and his wife Mary Falconer (n\u00e9e Norvell), and Joseph Home of Chirnside in the County of Berwick, an advocate of Ninewells. Joseph died just after David's second birthday. Catherine, who never remarried, raised the two brothers and their sister on her own.\nHume changed his family name's spelling in 1734, as the surname 'Home' (pronounced as 'Hume') was not well-known in England. Hume never married and lived partly at his Chirnside family home in Berwickshire, which had belonged to the family since the 16th century. His finances as a young man were very \"slender\", as his family was not rich; as a younger son he had little patrimony to live on.\nHume attended the University of Edinburgh at an unusually early ageeither 12 or possibly as young as 10at a time when 14 was the typical age. Initially, Hume considered a career in law, because of his family. However, in his words, he came to have:\n...an insurmountable aversion to everything but the pursuits of Philosophy and general Learning; and while [my family] fanceyed I was poring over Voet and Vinnius, Cicero and Virgil were the Authors which I was secretly devouring.\nHe had little respect for the professors of his time, telling a friend in 1735 that \"there is nothing to be learnt from a Professor, which is not to be met with in Books\". He did not graduate.\n\"Disease of the learned\".\nAt around age 18, Hume made a philosophical discovery that opened up to him \"a new Scene of Thought\", inspiring him \"to throw up every other Pleasure or Business to apply entirely to it\". As he did not recount what this scene exactly was, commentators have offered a variety of speculations. One prominent interpretation among contemporary Humean scholarship is that this new \"scene of thought\" was Hume's realisation that Francis Hutcheson's theory of \"moral sense\" could be applied to the understanding of morality as well.\nFrom this inspiration, Hume set out to spend a minimum of 10 years reading and writing. He soon came to the verge of a mental breakdown, first starting with a coldnesswhich he attributed to a \"Laziness of Temper\"that lasted about nine months. Scurvy spots later broke out on his fingers, persuading Hume's physician to diagnose him with the \"Disease of the Learned\".\nHume wrote that he \"went under a Course of Bitters and Anti-Hysteric Pills\", taken along with a pint of claret every day. He also decided to have a more active life to better continue his learning. His health improved somewhat, but in 1731, he was afflicted with a ravenous appetite and palpitations. After eating well for a time, he went from being \"tall, lean and raw-bon'd\" to being \"sturdy, robust [and] healthful-like.\" Indeed, Hume would become well known for being obese and having a fondness for good port and cheese, often using them as philosophical metaphors for his conjectures.\nCareer.\nDespite having noble ancestry, Hume had no source of income and no learned profession by age 25. As was common at his time, he became a merchant's assistant, despite having to leave his native Scotland. He travelled via Bristol to La Fl\u00e8che in Anjou, France. There he had frequent discourse with the Jesuits of the College of La Fl\u00e8che.\nHume was derailed in his attempts to start a university career by protests over his alleged \"atheism\", also lamenting that his literary debut, \"A Treatise of Human Nature\", \"fell dead-born from the press.\" However, he found literary success in his lifetime as an essayist, and a career as a librarian at the University of Edinburgh. These successes provided him much needed income at the time. His tenure there, and the access to research materials it provided, resulted in Hume's writing the massive six-volume \"The History of England\", which became a bestseller and the standard history of England in its day. For over 60 years, Hume was the dominant interpreter of English history. He described his \"love for literary fame\" as his \"ruling passion\" and judged his two late works, the so-called \"first\" and \"second\" enquiries, \"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\" and \"An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals\", as his greatest literary and philosophical achievements. He would ask of his contemporaries to judge him on the merits of the later texts alone, rather than on the more radical formulations of his early, youthful work, dismissing his philosophical debut as juvenilia: \"A work which the Author had projected before he left College.\" Despite Hume's protestations, a consensus exists today that his most important arguments and philosophically distinctive doctrines are found in the original form they take in the \"Treatise\". Though he was only 23 years old when starting this work, it is now regarded as one of the most important in the history of Western philosophy.\n1730s.\nHume worked for four years on his first major work, \"A Treatise of Human Nature\", subtitled \"Being an Attempt to Introduce the Experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects\", completing it in 1738 at age 28. Although many scholars today consider the \"Treatise\" to be Hume's most important work and one of the most important books in Western philosophy, critics in Great Britain at the time described it as \"abstract and unintelligible\". As Hume had spent most of his savings during those four years, he resolved \"to make a very rigid frugality supply [his] deficiency of fortune, to maintain unimpaired [his] independency, and to regard every object as contemptible except the improvements of [his] talents in literature\".\nDespite the disappointment, Hume later wrote: \"Being naturally of a cheerful and sanguine temper, I soon recovered from the blow and prosecuted with great ardour my studies in the country.\" There, in an attempt to make his larger work better known and more intelligible, he published the \"An Abstract of a Book lately Published\" as a summary of the main doctrines of the \"Treatise\", without revealing its authorship. This work contained the same ideas, but with a shorter and clearer explanation. Although there has been some academic speculation as to the pamphlet's true author, it is generally regarded as Hume's creation.\n1740s.\nAfter the publication of \"Essays Moral and Political\" in 1741included in the later edition as \"Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary\"Hume applied for the Chair of Pneumatics and Moral Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. However, the position was given to William Cleghorn after Edinburgh ministers petitioned the town council not to appoint Hume because he was seen as an atheist.\nIn 1745, during the Jacobite risings, Hume tutored the Marquess of Annandale, an engagement that ended in disarray after about a year. The Marquess could not follow with Hume's lectures, his father saw little need for philosophy, and on a personal level, the Marquess found Hume's dietary tendencies to be bizarre. Hume then started his great historical work, \"The History of England\", which took fifteen years and ran to over a million words. During this time, he was also involved with the Canongate Theatre through his friend John Home, a preacher.\nIn this context, he associated with Lord Monboddo and other thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment in Edinburgh. From 1746, Hume served for three years as secretary to General James St Clair, who was envoy to the courts of Turin and Vienna. At that time Hume wrote \"Philosophical Essays Concerning Human Understanding\", later published as \"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\". Often called the \"First Enquiry\", it proved little more successful than the \"Treatise\", perhaps because of the publication of his short autobiography \"My Own Life\", which \"made friends difficult for the first Enquiry\". By the end of this period Hume had attained his well-known corpulent stature; \"the good table of the General and the prolonged inactive life had done their work\", leaving him \"a man of tremendous bulk\".\nIn 1749 he went to live with his brother in the countryside, although he continued to associate with the aforementioned Scottish Enlightenment figures.\n1750s\u20131760s.\nHume's religious views were often suspect and, in the 1750s, it was necessary for his friends to avert a trial against him on the charge of heresy, specifically in an ecclesiastical court. However, he \"would not have come and could not be forced to attend if he said he was not a member of the Established Church\". Hume failed to gain the chair of philosophy at the University of Glasgow due to his religious views. By this time, he had published the \"Philosophical Essays\", which were decidedly anti-religious. This represented a turning point in his career and the various opportunities made available to him. Even Adam Smith, his personal friend who had vacated the Glasgow philosophy chair, was against his appointment out of concern that public opinion would be against it. In 1761, all his works were banned on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum.\nHume returned to Edinburgh in 1751. In the following year, the Faculty of Advocates hired him to be their Librarian, a job in which he would receive little to no pay, but which nonetheless gave him \"the command of a large library\". This resource enabled him to continue historical research for \"The History of England\". Hume's volume of \"Political Discourses\", written in 1749 and published by Kincaid &amp; Donaldson in 1752, was the only work he considered successful on first publication.\nIn 1753, Hume moved from his house on Riddles Court on the Lawnmarket to a house on the Canongate at the other end of the Royal Mile. Here he lived in a tenement known as Jack's Land, immediately west of the still surviving Shoemakers Land.\nEventually, with the publication of his six-volume \"The History of England\" between 1754 and 1762, Hume achieved the fame that he coveted. The volumes traced events from the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution of 1688 and was a bestseller in its day. Hume was also a longtime friend of bookseller Andrew Millar, who sold Hume's \"History\" (after acquiring the rights from Scottish bookseller Gavin Hamilton), although the relationship was sometimes complicated. Letters between them illuminate both men's interest in the success of the \"History\". In 1762 Hume moved from Jack's Land on the Canongate to James Court on the Lawnmarket. He sold the house to James Boswell in 1766.\nLater life.\nFrom 1763 to 1765, Hume was invited to attend Lord Hertford in Paris, where he became secretary to the British embassy in France. Hume was well received among Parisian society, and while there he met with Isaac de Pinto. In 1765, Hume served as a charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Paris, writing \"despatches to the British Secretary of State\". He wrote of his Paris life, \"I really wish often for the plain roughness of The Poker Club of Edinburgh... to correct and qualify so much lusciousness.\" Upon returning to Britain in 1766, Hume wrote a letter to Lord Hertford after being asked to by George Colebrooke; the letter informed Lord Hertford that he had an opportunity to invest in one of Colebrooke's slave plantations in the West Indies, though Hertford ultimately decided not to do so. In June of that year, Hume facilitated the purchase of a slave plantation in Martinique on behalf of his friend, the wine merchant John Stewart, by writing to the colony's governor Victor-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Charpentier.\nAccording to Felix Waldmann, a former Hume Fellow at the University of Edinburgh, Hume's \"puckish scepticism about the existence of religious miracles played a significant part in defining the critical outlook which underpins the practice of modern science.\" Waldmann also argued that Hume's views \"served to reinforce the institution of racialised slavery in the later 18th century.\" In 1766, Hume left Paris to accompany Jean-Jacques Rousseau to England. Once there, he and Rousseau fell out, leaving Hume sufficiently worried about the damage to his reputation from the quarrel with Rousseau that he would author an account of the dispute, titling it \"A concise and genuine account of the dispute between Mr. Hume and Mr. Rousseau\".\nIn 1767, Hume was appointed Under Secretary of State for the Northern Department. Here, he wrote that he was given \"all the secrets of the Kingdom\". In 1769 he returned to James' Court in Edinburgh, where he would live from 1771 until his death in 1776. Hume's nephew and namesake, David Hume of Ninewells (1757\u20131838), was a co-founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783. He was a Professor of Scots Law at Edinburgh University and rose to be Principal Clerk of Session in the Scottish High Court and Baron of the Exchequer. He is buried with his uncle in Old Calton Cemetery.\nAutobiography.\nIn the last year of his life, Hume wrote an extremely brief autobiographical essay titled \"My Own Life\", summing up his entire life in \"fewer than 5 pages\"; it contains many interesting judgments that have been of enduring interest to subsequent readers of Hume. Donald Seibert (1984), a scholar of 18th-century literature, judged it a \"remarkable autobiography, even though it may lack the usual attractions of that genre. Anyone hankering for startling revelations or amusing anecdotes had better look elsewhere.\"\nDespite condemning vanity as a dangerous passion, in his autobiography Hume confesses his belief that the \"love of literary fame\" had served as his \"ruling passion\" in life, and claims that this desire \"never soured my temper, notwithstanding my frequent disappointments\". One such disappointment Hume discusses in this account is in the initial literary reception of the \"Treatise\", which he claims to have overcome by means of the success of the \"Essays\": \"the work was favourably received, and soon made me entirely forget my former disappointment\". Hume, in his own retrospective judgment, argues that his philosophical debut's apparent failure \"had proceeded more from the manner than the matter\". He thus suggests that \"I had been guilty of a very usual indiscretion, in going to the press too early.\"\nHume also provides an unambiguous self-assessment of the relative value of his works: that \"my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals; which, in my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that subject) is of all my writings, historical, philosophical, or literary, incomparably the best.\" He also wrote of his social relations: \"My company was not unacceptable to the young and careless, as well as to the studious and literary\", noting of his complex relation to religion, as well as to the state, that \"though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury\". He goes on to profess of his character: \"My friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct.\" Hume concludes the essay with a frank admission:\nI cannot say there is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself, but I hope it is not a misplaced one; and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained.\nDeath.\nDiarist and biographer James Boswell saw Hume a few weeks before his death from a form of abdominal cancer. Hume told him that he sincerely believed it a \"most unreasonable fancy\" that there might be life after death. Hume asked that his body be interred in a \"simple Roman tomb\", requesting in his will that it be inscribed only with his name and the year of his birth and death, \"leaving it to Posterity to add the Rest\".\nDavid Hume died at the southwest corner of St. Andrew's Square in Edinburgh's New Town, at what is now 21 Saint David Street. A popular story, consistent with some historical evidence and with the help of coincidence, suggests that the street was named after Hume.\nHis tomb stands, as he wished it, on the southwestern slope of Calton Hill, in the Old Calton Cemetery. Adam Smith later recounted Hume's amusing speculation that he might ask Charon, Hades' ferryman, to allow him a few more years of life in order to see \"the downfall of some of the prevailing systems of superstition\". The ferryman replied, \"You loitering rogue, that will not happen these many hundred years.\u2026 Get into the boat this instant.\"\nWritings.\n\"A Treatise of Human Nature\" begins with the introduction: \"'Tis evident, that all the sciences have a relation, more or less, to human nature.\u2026 Even Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Natural Religion, are in some measure dependent on the science of Man.\" The science of man, as Hume explains, is the \"only solid foundation for the other sciences\" and that the method for this science requires both experience and observation as the foundations of a logical argument. In regards to this, philosophical historian Frederick Copleston (1999) suggests that it was Hume's aim to apply to the science of man the method of experimental philosophy (the term that was current at the time to imply natural philosophy), and that \"Hume's plan is to extend to philosophy in general the methodological limitations of Newtonian physics.\"\nUntil recently, Hume was seen as a forerunner of logical positivism, a form of anti-metaphysical empiricism. According to the logical positivists (in summary of their verification principle), unless a statement could be verified by experience, or else was true or false by definition (i.e., either tautological or contradictory), then it was meaningless. Hume, on this view, was a protopositivist, who, in his philosophical writings, attempted to demonstrate the ways in which ordinary propositions about objects, causal relations, the self, and so on, are semantically equivalent to propositions about one's experiences.\nMany commentators have since rejected this understanding of Humean empiricism, stressing an epistemological (rather than a semantic) reading of his project. According to this opposing view, Hume's empiricism consisted in the idea that it is our knowledge, and not our ability to conceive, that is restricted to what can be experienced. Hume thought that we can form beliefs about that which extends beyond any possible experience, through the operation of faculties such as custom and the imagination, but he was sceptical about claims to knowledge on this basis.\nImpressions and ideas.\nA central doctrine of Hume's philosophy, stated in the very first lines of the \"Treatise of Human Nature\", is that the mind consists of perceptions, or the mental objects which are present to it, and which divide into two categories: \"All the perceptions of the human mind resolve themselves into two distinct kinds, which I shall call and .\" Hume believed that it would \"not be very necessary to employ many words in explaining this distinction\", which commentators have generally taken to mean the distinction between \"feeling\" and \"thinking\". Controversially, Hume, in some sense, may regard the distinction as a matter of degree, as he takes \"impressions\" to be distinguished from ideas on the basis of their force, liveliness, and vivacitywhat Henry E. Allison (2008) calls the \"FLV criterion.\" \"Ideas\" are therefore \"faint\" impressions. For example, experiencing the painful sensation of touching a hot pan's handle is more forceful than simply thinking about touching a hot pan. According to Hume, \"impressions\" are meant to be the original form of all our ideas. From this, Don Garrett (2002) has coined the term \"copy principle,\" referring to Hume's doctrine that all ideas are ultimately copied from some original impression, whether it be a passion or sensation, from which they derive.\nSimple and complex.\nAfter establishing the forcefulness of impressions and ideas, these two categories are further broken down into \"simple\" and \"complex\": \"simple perceptions or impressions and ideas are such as admit of no distinction nor separation\", whereas \"the complex are the contrary to these, and may be distinguished into parts\". When looking at an apple, a person experiences a variety of colour-sensationswhat Hume notes as a complex impression. Similarly, a person experiences a variety of taste-sensations, tactile-sensations, and smell-sensations when biting into an apple, with the overall sensationagain, a complex impression. Thinking about an apple allows a person to form complex ideas, which are made of similar parts as the complex impressions they were developed from, but which are also less forceful. Hume believes that complex perceptions can be broken down into smaller and smaller parts until perceptions are reached that have no parts of their own, and these perceptions are thus referred to as simple.\nPrinciples of association.\nRegardless of how boundless it may seem; a person's imagination is confined to the mind's ability to recombine the information it has already acquired from the body's sensory experience (the ideas that have been derived from impressions). In addition, \"as our imagination takes our most basic ideas and leads us to form new ones, it is directed by three principles of association, namely, resemblance, contiguity, and cause and effect\":\nHume elaborates more on the last principle, explaining that, when somebody observes that one object or event consistently produces the same object or event, that results in \"an expectation that a particular event (a 'cause') will be followed by another event (an 'effect') previously and constantly associated with it\". Hume calls this principle \"custom\", or \"habit\", saying that \"custom...renders our experience useful to us, and makes us expect, for the future, a similar train of events with those which have appeared in the past\". However, even though custom can serve as a guide in life, it still only represents an expectation. In other words:\nExperience cannot establish a necessary connection between cause and effect, because we can imagine without contradiction a case where the cause does not produce its usual effect\u2026the reason why we mistakenly infer that there is something in the cause that necessarily produces its effect is because our past experiences have habituated us to think in this way. \nContinuing this idea, Hume argues that \"only in the pure realm of ideas, logic, and mathematics, not contingent on the direct sense awareness of reality, [can] causation safely\u2026be applied\u2014all other sciences are reduced to probability\". He uses this scepticism to reject metaphysics and many theological views on the basis that they are not grounded in fact and observations, and are therefore beyond the reach of human understanding.\nInduction and causation.\nThe cornerstone of Hume's epistemology is the problem of induction. This may be the area of Hume's thought where his scepticism about human powers of reason is most pronounced. The problem revolves around the plausibility of inductive reasoning, that is, reasoning from the observed behaviour of objects to their behaviour when unobserved. As Hume wrote, induction concerns how things behave when they go \"beyond the present testimony of the senses, or the records of our memory\". Hume argues that we tend to believe that things behave in a regular manner, meaning that patterns in the behaviour of objects seem to persist into the future, and throughout the unobserved present. Hume's argument is that we cannot rationally justify the claim that nature will continue to be uniform, as justification comes in only two varieties\u2014demonstrative reasoning and probable reasoning\u2014and both of these are inadequate. With regard to demonstrative reasoning, Hume argues that the uniformity principle cannot be demonstrated, as it is \"consistent and conceivable\" that nature might stop being regular. Turning to probable reasoning, Hume argues that we cannot hold that nature will continue to be uniform because it has been in the past. As this is using the very sort of reasoning (induction) that is under question, it would be circular reasoning. Thus, no form of justification will rationally warrant our inductive inferences.\nHume's solution to this problem is to argue that, rather than reason, natural instinct explains the human practice of making inductive inferences. He asserts that \"Nature, by an absolute and uncontroulable necessity has determin'd us to judge as well as to breathe and feel.\" In 1985, and in agreement with Hume, John D. Kenyon writes:\nReason might manage to raise a doubt about the truth of a conclusion of natural inductive inference just for a moment\u00a0... but the sheer agreeableness of animal faith will protect us from excessive caution and sterile suspension of belief.\nOthers, such as Charles Sanders Peirce, have demurred from Hume's solution, while some, such as Kant and Karl Popper, have thought that Hume's analysis has \"posed a most fundamental challenge to all human knowledge claims\".\nThe notion of causation is closely linked to the problem of induction. According to Hume, we reason inductively by associating constantly conjoined events. It is the mental act of association that is the basis of our concept of causation. At least three interpretations of Hume's theory of causation are represented in the literature:\nHume acknowledged that there are events constantly unfolding, and humanity cannot guarantee that these events are caused by prior events or are independent instances. He opposed the widely accepted theory of causation that 'all events have a specific course or reason'. Therefore, Hume crafted his own theory of causation, formed through his empiricist and sceptic beliefs. He split causation into two realms: \"All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds, to wit, Relations of Ideas, and Matters of Fact.\" Relations of Ideas are \"a priori\" and represent universal bonds between ideas that mark the cornerstones of human thought. Matters of Fact are dependent on the observer and experience. They are often not universally held to be true among multiple persons. Hume was an Empiricist, meaning he believed \"causes and effects are discoverable not by reason, but by experience\". He goes on to say that, even with the perspective of the past, humanity cannot dictate future events because thoughts of the past are limited, compared to the possibilities for the future. Hume's separation between Matters of Fact and Relations of Ideas is often referred to as \"Hume's fork.\"\nHume explains his theory of causation and causal inference by division into three different parts. In these three branches he explains his ideas and compares and contrasts his views to his predecessors. These branches are the Critical Phase, the Constructive Phase, and Belief. In the Critical Phase, Hume denies his predecessors' theories of causation. Next, he uses the Constructive Phase to resolve any doubts the reader may have had while observing the Critical Phase. \"Habit or Custom\" mends the gaps in reasoning that occur without the human mind even realising it. Associating ideas has become second nature to the human mind. It \"makes us expect for the future, a similar train of events with those which have appeared in the past\". However, Hume says that this association cannot be trusted because the span of the human mind to comprehend the past is not necessarily applicable to the wide and distant future. This leads him to the third branch of causal inference, Belief. Belief is what drives the human mind to hold that expectancy of the future is based on past experience. Throughout his explanation of causal inference, Hume is arguing that the future is not certain to be repetition of the past and that the only way to justify induction is through uniformity.\nThe logical positivist interpretation is that Hume analyses causal propositions, such as \"A causes B\", in terms of regularities in perception: \"A causes B\" is equivalent to \"Whenever A-type events happen, B-type ones follow\", where \"whenever\" refers to all possible perceptions. In his \"Treatise of Human Nature\", Hume wrote:\nPower and necessity\u2026are\u2026qualities of perceptions, not of objects\u2026felt by the soul and not perceiv'd externally in bodies.\nThis view is rejected by sceptical realists, who argue that Hume thought that causation amounts to more than just the regular succession of events. Hume said that, when two events are causally conjoined, a necessary connection underpins the conjunction:\nShall we rest contented with these two relations of contiguity and succession, as affording a complete idea of causation? By no means\u2026there is a \"necessary connexion\" to be taken into consideration.\nAngela Coventry writes that, for Hume, \"there is nothing in any particular instance of cause and effect involving external objects which suggests the idea of power or necessary connection\" and \"we are ignorant of the powers that operate between objects\". However, while denying the possibility of knowing the powers between objects, Hume accepted the causal principle, writing: \"I never asserted so absurd a proposition as that something could arise without a cause.\"\nIt has been argued that, while Hume did not think that causation is reducible to pure regularity, he was not a fully-fledged realist either. Simon Blackburn calls this a quasi-realist reading, saying that \"Someone talking of cause is voicing a distinct mental set: he is by no means in the same state as someone merely describing regular sequences.\" In Hume's words, \"nothing is more usual than to apply to external bodies every internal sensation, which they occasion\".\n'Self'.\nEmpiricist philosophers, such as Hume and Berkeley, favoured the bundle theory of personal identity. In this theory, \"the mind itself, far from being an independent power, is simply 'a bundle of perceptions' without unity or cohesive quality\". The self is nothing but a bundle of experiences linked by the relations of causation and resemblance; or, more accurately, the empirically warranted idea of the self is just the idea of such a bundle. According to Hume:\nThis view is supported by, for example, positivist interpreters, who have seen Hume as suggesting that terms such as \"self\", \"person\", or \"mind\" refer to collections of \"sense-contents\". A modern-day version of the bundle theory of the mind has been advanced by Derek Parfit in his \"Reasons and Persons\".\nHowever, some philosophers have criticised Hume's bundle-theory interpretation of personal identity. They argue that distinct selves can have perceptions that stand in relation to similarity and causality. Thus, perceptions must already come parcelled into distinct \"bundles\" before they can be associated according to the relations of similarity and causality. In other words, the mind must already possess a unity that cannot be generated, or constituted, by these relations alone. Since the bundle-theory interpretation portrays Hume as answering an ontological question, philosophers like Galen Strawson see Hume as not very concerned with such questions and have queried whether this view is really Hume's. Instead, Strawson suggests that Hume might have been answering an epistemological question about the causal origin of our concept of the self. In the Appendix to the \"Treatise\", Hume declares himself dissatisfied with his earlier account of personal identity in Book 1. Corliss Swain notes that \"Commentators agree that if Hume did find some new problem\" when he reviewed the section on personal identity, \"he wasn't forthcoming about its nature in the Appendix.\" One interpretation of Hume's view of the self, argued for by philosopher and psychologist James Giles, is that Hume is not arguing for a bundle theory, which is a form of reductionism, but rather for an eliminative view of the self. Rather than reducing the self to a bundle of perceptions, Hume rejects the idea of the self altogether. On this interpretation, Hume is proposing a \"no-self theory\" and thus has much in common with Buddhist thought (see \"anatt\u0101\"). Psychologist Alison Gopnik has argued that Hume was in a position to learn about Buddhist thought during his time in France in the 1730s.\nPractical reason.\n\"Practical reason\" relates to whether standards or principles exist that are also authoritative for all rational beings, dictating people's intentions and actions. Hume is mainly considered an anti-rationalist, denying the possibility for practical reason, although other philosophers such as Christine Korsgaard, Jean Hampton, and Elijah Millgram claim that Hume is not so much of an anti-rationalist as he is just a sceptic of practical reason.\nHume denied the existence of practical reason as a principle because he claimed reason does not have any effect on morality, since morality is capable of producing effects in people that reason alone cannot create. As Hume explains in \"A Treatise of Human Nature\" (1740):\nMorals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason of itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.\"\nSince practical reason is supposed to regulate our actions (in theory), Hume denied practical reason on the grounds that reason cannot directly oppose passions. As Hume puts it, \"Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.\" Reason is less significant than any passion because reason has no original influence, while \"A passion is an original existence, or, if you will, modification of existence.\"\nPractical reason is also concerned with the value of actions rather than the truth of propositions, so Hume believed that reason's shortcoming of affecting morality proved that practical reason could not be authoritative for all rational beings, since morality was essential for dictating people's intentions and actions.\nEthics.\nHume's writings on ethics began in the 1740 \"Treatise\" and were refined in his \"An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals\" (1751). He understood \"feeling\", rather than \"knowing\", as that which governs ethical actions, stating that \"moral decisions are grounded in moral sentiment.\" Arguing that reason cannot be behind morality, he wrote:\nMorals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.\nHume's \"moral sentimentalism\" was shared by his close friend Adam Smith, and the two were mutually influenced by the moral reflections of their older contemporary, Francis Hutcheson. Peter Singer claims that Hume's argument that morals cannot have a rational basis alone \"would have been enough to earn him a place in the history of ethics.\"\nHume also put forward the \"is\u2013ought problem\", later known as \"Hume's Law\", denying the possibility of logically deriving what \"ought\" to be from what \"is\". According to the \"Treatise\" (1740), in every system of morality that Hume has read, the author begins by stating facts about the world as it \"is\" but always ends up suddenly referring to what \"ought\" to be the case. Hume demands that a reason should be given for inferring what \"ought to be\" the case, from \"what is\" the case. This is because it \"seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others.\"\nHume's theory of ethics has been influential in modern-day meta-ethical theory, helping to inspire emotivism, and ethical expressivism and non-cognitivism, as well as Allan Gibbard's general theory of moral judgment and judgments of rationality.\nAesthetics.\nHume's ideas about aesthetics and the theory of art are spread throughout his works, but are particularly connected with his ethical writings, and also the essays \"Of the Standard of Taste\" and \"Of Tragedy\" (1757). His views are rooted in the work of Joseph Addison and Francis Hutcheson. In the \"Treatise\" (1740), he touches on the connection between beauty and deformity and vice and virtue. His later writings on the subject continue to draw parallels of beauty and deformity in art with conduct and character.\nIn \"Standard of Taste\", Hume argues that no rules can be drawn up about what is a tasteful object. However, a reliable critic of taste can be recognised as objective, sensible and unprejudiced, and as having extensive experience. \"Of Tragedy\" addresses the question of why humans enjoy tragic drama. Hume was concerned with the way spectators find pleasure in the sorrow and anxiety depicted in a tragedy. He argued that this was because the spectator is aware that he is witnessing a dramatic performance. There is pleasure in realising that the terrible events that are being shown are actually fiction. Furthermore, Hume laid down rules for educating people in taste and correct conduct, and his writings in this area have been very influential on English and Anglo-Saxon aesthetics.\nFree will, determinism, and responsibility.\nHume, along with Thomas Hobbes, is cited as a classical compatibilist about the notions of freedom and determinism. \"Compatibilism\" seeks to reconcile human freedom with the mechanist view that human beings are part of a deterministic universe, which is completely governed by physical laws. Hume, on this point, was influenced greatly by the scientific revolution, particularly by Sir Isaac Newton. Hume argued that the dispute between freedom and determinism continued over 2000 years due to ambiguous terminology. He wrote: \"From this circumstance alone, that a controversy has been long kept on foot\u2026we may presume that there is some ambiguity in the expression,\" and that different disputants use different meanings for the same terms.\nHume defines the concept of necessity as \"the uniformity, observable in the operations of nature; where similar objects are constantly conjoined together,\" and liberty as \"a power of acting or not acting, according to the determinations of the will.\" He then argues that, according to these definitions, not only are the two compatible, but liberty \"requires\" necessity. For if our actions were not necessitated in the above sense, they would \"have so little in connexion with motives, inclinations and circumstances, that one does not follow with a certain degree of uniformity from the other.\" But if our actions are not thus connected to the will, then our actions can never be free: they would be matters of \"chance; which is universally allowed to have no existence.\" Australian philosopher John Passmore writes that confusion has arisen because \"necessity\" has been taken to mean \"necessary connexion.\" Once this has been abandoned, Hume argues that \"liberty and necessity will be found not to be in conflict one with another.\"\nMoreover, Hume goes on to argue that in order to be held morally responsible, it is required that our behaviour be caused or necessitated, for, as he wrote:\nActions are, by their very nature, temporary and perishing; and where they proceed not from some \"cause\" in the character and disposition of the person who performed them, they can neither redound to his honour, if good; nor infamy, if evil.\nHume describes the link between causality and our capacity to rationally make a decision from this an inference of the mind. Human beings assess a situation based upon certain predetermined events and from that form a choice. Hume believes that this choice is made spontaneously. Hume calls this form of decision making the liberty of spontaneity.\nEducation writer Richard Wright considers that Hume's position rejects a famous moral puzzle attributed to French philosopher Jean Buridan. The Buridan's ass puzzle describes a donkey that is hungry. This donkey has separate bales of hay on both sides, which are of equal distances from him. The problem concerns which bale the donkey chooses. Buridan was said to believe that the donkey would die, because he has no autonomy. The donkey is incapable of forming a rational decision as there is no motive to choose one bale of hay over the other. However, human beings are different, because a human who is placed in a position where he is forced to choose one loaf of bread over another will make a decision to take one in lieu of the other. For Buridan, humans have the capacity of autonomy, and he recognises the choice that is ultimately made will be based on chance, as both loaves of bread are exactly the same. However, Wright says that Hume completely rejects this notion, arguing that a human will spontaneously act in such a situation because he is faced with impending death if he fails to do so. Such a decision is not made on the basis of chance, but rather on necessity and spontaneity, given the prior predetermined events leading up to the predicament.\nHume's argument is supported by modern-day compatibilists such as R. E. Hobart, a pseudonym of philosopher Dickinson S. Miller. However, P. F. Strawson argued that the issue of whether we hold one another morally responsible does not ultimately depend on the truth or falsity of a metaphysical thesis such as determinism. This is because our so holding one another is a non-rational human sentiment that is not predicated on such theses.\nReligion.\nPhilosopher Paul Russell (2005) contends that Hume wrote \"on almost every central question in the philosophy of religion\", and that these writings \"are among the most important and influential contributions on this topic.\" Touching on the philosophy, psychology, history, and anthropology of religious thought, Hume's 1757 dissertation \"The Natural History of Religion\" argues that the monotheistic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all derive from earlier polytheistic religions. He went on to suggest that all religious belief \"traces, in the end, to dread of the unknown\". Hume had also written on religious subjects in the first \"Enquiry\", as well as later in the \"Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion\".\nReligious views.\nAlthough he wrote a great deal about religion, Hume's personal views have been the subject of much debate. Some modern critics have described Hume's religious views as agnostic or have described him as a \"Pyrrhonian skeptic\". Contemporaries considered him to be an atheist, or at least un-Christian, enough so that the Church of Scotland seriously considered bringing charges of infidelity against him. Evidence of his un-Christian beliefs can especially be found in his writings on miracles, in which he attempts to separate historical method from the narrative accounts of miracles. Nevertheless, modern scholars have tended to dismiss the claims of Hume's contemporaries describing him as an atheist as coming from religiously intolerant people who did not understand Hume\u2019s philosophy. The fact that contemporaries suspected him of atheism is exemplified by a story Hume liked to tell:\nThe best theologian he ever met, he used to say, was the old Edinburgh fishwife who, having recognized him as Hume the atheist, refused to pull him out of the bog into which he had fallen until he declared he was a Christian and repeated the Lord's prayer.\nHowever, in works such as \"Of Superstition and Enthusiasm\", Hume specifically seems to support the standard religious views of his time and place. This still meant that he could be very critical of the Catholic Church, dismissing it with the standard Protestant accusations of superstition and idolatry, as well as dismissing as idolatry what his compatriots saw as uncivilised beliefs. He also considered extreme Protestant sects, the members of which he called \"enthusiasts\", to be corrupters of religion. By contrast, in \"The Natural History of Religion\", Hume presents arguments suggesting that polytheism had much to commend it over monotheism. Additionally, when mentioning religion as a factor in his \"History of England\", Hume uses it to show the deleterious effect it has on human progress. In his \"Treatise of Human Nature\", Hume wrote: \"Generally speaking, the errors in religions are dangerous; those in philosophy only ridiculous.\"\nLou Reich (1998) argues that Hume was a religious naturalist and rejects interpretations of Hume as an atheist. Paul Russell (2008) writes that Hume was plainly sceptical about religious belief, although perhaps not to the extent of complete atheism. He suggests that Hume's position is best characterised by the term \"irreligion,\" while philosopher David O'Connor (2013) argues that Hume's final position was \"weakly deistic\". For O'Connor, Hume's \"position is deeply ironic. This is because, while inclining towards a weak form of deism, he seriously doubts that we can ever find a sufficiently favourable balance of evidence to justify accepting any religious position.\" He adds that Hume \"did not believe in the God of standard theism ... but he did not rule out all concepts of deity\", and that \"ambiguity suited his purposes, and this creates difficulty in definitively pinning down his final position on religion\".\nDesign argument.\nOne of the traditional topics of natural theology is that of the existence of God, and one of the \"a posteriori\" arguments for this is the \"argument from design\" or the teleological argument. The argument is that the existence of God can be proved by the design that is obvious in the complexity of the world, which \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" states is \"the most popular\", because it is:\n...the most accessible of the theistic arguments ... which identifies evidences of design in nature, inferring from them a divine designer ... The fact that the universe as a whole is a coherent and efficiently functioning system likewise, in this view, indicates a divine intelligence behind it.\nIn \"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\", Hume wrote that the design argument seems to depend upon our experience, and its proponents \"always suppose the universe, an effect quite singular and unparalleled, to be the proof of a Deity, a cause no less singular and unparalleled\". Philosopher Louise E. Loeb (2010) notes that Hume is saying that only experience and observation can be our guide to making inferences about the conjunction between events. However, according to Hume: \nWe observe neither God nor other universes, and hence no conjunction involving them. There is no observed conjunction to ground an inference either to extended objects or to God, as unobserved causes.\nHume also criticised the argument in his \"Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion\" (1779). Hume proposes a finite universe with a finite number of particles. Given infinite time, these particles could randomly fall into any arrangement, including our seemingly designed world.\nA century later, the idea of order without design was rendered more plausible by Charles Darwin's discovery that the adaptations of the forms of life result from the natural selection of inherited characteristics. For philosopher James D. Madden, it is \"Hume, rivaled only by Darwin, [who] has done the most to undermine in principle our confidence in arguments from design among all figures in the Western intellectual tradition\".\nFinally, Hume discussed a version of the anthropic principle, which is the idea that theories of the universe are constrained by the need to allow for man's existence in it as an observer. Hume has his sceptical mouthpiece Philo suggest that there may have been many worlds, produced by an incompetent designer, whom he called a \"stupid mechanic\". In his \"Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion\", Hume wrote:\nMany worlds might have been botched and bungled throughout an eternity, ere this system was struck out: much labour lost: many fruitless trials made: and a slow, but continued improvement carried on during infinite ages in the art of world-making.\nAmerican philosopher Daniel Dennett has suggested that this mechanical explanation of teleology, although \"obviously\u00a0... an amusing philosophical fantasy\", anticipated the notion of natural selection, the 'continued improvement' being like \"any Darwinian selection algorithm\".\nProblem of miracles.\nIn his discussion of miracles, Hume argues that we should not believe miracles have occurred and that they do not therefore provide us with any reason to think God exists. In \"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\" (Section 10), Hume defines a miracle as \"a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent\". Hume says we believe an event that has frequently occurred is likely to occur again, but we also take into account those instances where the event did not occur:\nA wise man ... considers which side is supported by the greater number of experiments. ... A hundred instances or experiments on one side, and fifty on another, afford a doubtful expectation of any event; though a hundred uniform experiments, with only one that is contradictory, reasonably beget a pretty strong degree of assurance. In all cases, we must balance the opposite experiments ... and deduct the smaller number from the greater, in order to know the exact force of the superior evidence.\nHume discusses the testimony of those who report miracles. He wrote that testimony might be doubted even from some great authority in case the facts themselves are not credible: \"[T]he evidence, resulting from the testimony, admits of a diminution, greater or less, in proportion as the fact is more or less unusual.\"\nAlthough Hume leaves open the possibility for miracles to occur and be reported, he offers various arguments against this ever having happened in history. He points out that people often lie, and they have good reasons to lie about miracles occurring either because they believe they are doing so for the benefit of their religion or because of the fame that results. Furthermore, people by nature enjoy relating miracles they have heard without caring for their veracity and thus miracles are easily transmitted even when false. Also, Hume notes that miracles seem to occur mostly in \"ignorant and barbarous nations\" and times, and the reason they do not occur in the civilised societies is such societies are not awed by what they know to be natural events. Hume recognizes that over a long period of time, various coincidences can provide the appearance of intention. Finally, the miracles of each religion argue against all other religions and their miracles, and so even if a proportion of all reported miracles across the world fit Hume's requirement for belief, the miracles of each religion make the other less likely.\nHume was extremely pleased with his argument against miracles in his \"Enquiry\". He states, \"I flatter myself, that I have discovered an argument of a like nature, which, if just, will, with the wise and learned, be an everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusion, and consequently, will be useful as long as the world endures.\" Thus, Hume's argument against miracles had a more abstract basis founded upon the scrutiny, not just primarily of miracles, but of all forms of belief systems. It is a commonsense notion of veracity based upon epistemological evidence, and founded on a principle of rationality, proportionality and reasonability.\nThe criterion for assessing Hume's belief system is based on the balance of probability whether something is more likely than not to have occurred. Since the weight of empirical experience contradicts the notion for the existence of miracles, such accounts should be treated with scepticism. Further, the myriad of accounts of miracles contradict one another, as some people who receive miracles will aim to prove the authority of Jesus, whereas others will aim to prove the authority of Muhammad or some other religious prophet or deity. These various differing accounts weaken the overall evidential power of miracles.\nDespite all this, Hume observes that belief in miracles is popular, and that \"the gazing populace\u2026 receive greedily, without examination, whatever soothes superstition, and promotes wonder.\"\nCritics have argued that Hume's position assumes the character of miracles and natural laws prior to any specific examination of miracle claims, thus it amounts to a subtle form of begging the question. To assume that testimony is a homogeneous reference group seems unwise- to compare private miracles with public miracles, unintellectual observers with intellectual observers and those who have little to gain and much to lose with those with much to gain and little to lose is not convincing to many. Indeed, many have argued that miracles not only do not contradict the laws of nature but require the laws of nature to be intelligible as miraculous, and thus subverting the law of nature. For example, William Adams remarks that \"there must be an ordinary course of nature before anything can be extraordinary. There must be a stream before anything can be interrupted.\" They have also noted that it requires an appeal to inductive inference, as none have observed every part of nature nor examined every possible miracle claim, for instance those in the future. This, in Hume's philosophy, was especially problematic.\nLittle appreciated is the voluminous literature either foreshadowing Hume, in the likes of Thomas Sherlock or directly responding to and engaging with Hume\u2014from William Paley, William Adams, John Douglas, John Leland, and George Campbell, among others. Regarding the latter, it is rumoured that, having read Campbell's Dissertation, Hume remarked that \"the Scotch theologue had beaten him.\"\nHume's main argument concerning miracles is that miracles by definition are singular events that differ from the established laws of nature. Such natural laws are codified as a result of past experiences. Therefore, a miracle is a violation of all prior experience and thus incapable on this basis of reasonable belief. However, the probability that something has occurred in contradiction of all past experience should always be judged to be less than the probability that either one's senses have deceived one, or the person recounting the miraculous occurrence is lying or mistaken, Hume would say, all of which he had past experience of. For Hume, this refusal to grant credence does not guarantee correctness. He offers the example of an Indian Prince, who, having grown up in a hot country, refuses to believe that water has frozen. By Hume's lights, this refusal is not wrong and the prince \"reasoned justly;\" it is presumably only when he has had extensive experience of the freezing of water that he has warrant to believe that the event could occur.\nSo, for Hume, either the miraculous event will become a recurrent event or else it will never be rational to believe it occurred. The connection to religious belief is left unexplained throughout, except for the close of his discussion where Hume notes the reliance of Christianity upon testimony of miraculous occurrences. He makes an ironic remark that anyone who \"is moved by faith to assent\" to revealed testimony \"is conscious of a continued miracle in his own person, which subverts all principles of his understanding, and gives him a determination to believe what is most contrary to custom and experience.\" Hume writes that \"All the testimony whichever was really given for any miracle, or ever will be given, is a subject of derision.\"\nAs a historian of England.\nFrom 1754 to 1762 Hume published \"The History of England\", a six-volume work, that extends (according to its subtitle) \"From the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in 1688.\" Inspired by Voltaire's sense of the breadth of history, Hume widened the focus of the field away from merely kings, parliaments, and armies, to literature and science as well. He argued that the quest for liberty was the highest standard for judging the past, and concluded that after considerable fluctuation, England at the time of his writing had achieved \"the most entire system of liberty that was ever known amongst mankind\". It \"must be regarded as an event of cultural importance. In its own day, moreover, it was an innovation, soaring high above its very few predecessors.\" Hume's \"History of England\" made him famous as a historian before he was ever considered a serious philosopher. In this work, Hume uses history to tell the story of the rise of England and what led to its greatness and the disastrous effects that religion has had on its progress. For Hume, the history of England's rise may give a template for others who would also like to rise to its current greatness.\nHume's \"The History of England\" was profoundly impacted by his Scottish background. The science of sociology, which is rooted in Scottish thinking of the eighteenth century, had never before been applied to British philosophical history. Because of his Scottish background, Hume was able to bring an outsider's lens to English history that the insulated English whigs lacked.\nHume's coverage of the political upheavals of the 17th century relied in large part on the Earl of Clarendon's \"History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England\" (1646\u201369). Generally, Hume took a moderate royalist position and considered revolution unnecessary to achieve necessary reform. Hume was considered a Tory historian and emphasised religious differences more than constitutional issues. Laird Okie explains that \"Hume preached the virtues of political moderation, but\u00a0... it was moderation with an anti-Whig, pro-royalist coloring.\" For \"Hume shared the\u00a0... Tory belief that the Stuarts were no more high-handed than their Tudor predecessors\". \"Even though Hume wrote with an anti-Whig animus, it is, paradoxically, correct to regard the \"History\" as an establishment work, one which implicitly endorsed the ruling oligarchy\".\nHistorians have debated whether Hume posited a universal unchanging human nature, or allowed for evolution and development.\nThe debate between Tory and the Whig historians can be seen in the initial reception to Hume's \"History of England\". The whig-dominated world of 1754 overwhelmingly disapproved of Hume's take on English history. In later editions of the book, Hume worked to \"soften or expunge many villainous whig strokes which had crept into it.\"\nHume did not consider himself a pure Tory. Before 1745, he was more akin to an \"independent whig.\" In 1748, he described himself as \"a whig, though a very skeptical one.\" This description of himself as in between whiggism and toryism, helps one understand that his \"History of England\" should be read as his attempt to work out his own philosophy of history.\nRobert Roth argues that Hume's histories display his biases against Presbyterians and Puritans. Roth says his anti-Whig pro-monarchy position diminished the influence of his work, and that his emphasis on politics and religion led to a neglect of social and economic history.\nHume was an early cultural historian of science. His short biographies of leading scientists explored the process of scientific change. He developed new ways of seeing scientists in the context of their times by looking at how they interacted with society and each other. He covers over forty scientists, with special attention paid to Francis Bacon, Robert Boyle, and Isaac Newton. Hume particularly praised William Harvey, writing about his treatise of the circulation of the blood: \"Harvey is entitled to the glory of having made, by reasoning alone, without any mixture of accident, a capital discovery in one of the most important branches of science.\"\nThe \"History\" became a best-seller and made Hume a wealthy man who no longer had to take up salaried work for others. It was influential for nearly a century, despite competition from imitations by Smollett (1757), Goldsmith (1771) and others. By 1894, there were at least 50 editions as well as abridgements for students, and illustrated pocket editions, probably produced specifically for women.\nPolitical theory.\nMany of Hume's political ideas, such as limited government, private property when there is scarcity, and constitutionalism, are first principles of liberalism. Thomas Jefferson banned the \"History\" from University of Virginia, feeling that it had \"spread universal toryism over the land.\" By comparison, Samuel Johnson thought Hume to be \"a Tory by chance [...] for he has no principle. If he is anything, he is a Hobbist.\" A major concern of Hume's political philosophy is the importance of the rule of law. He also stresses throughout his political essays the importance of moderation in politics, public spirit, and regard to the community.\nThroughout the period of the American Revolution, Hume had varying views. For instance, in 1768 he encouraged total revolt on the part of the Americans. In 1775, he became certain that a revolution would take place and said that he believed in the American principle and wished the British government would let them be. Hume's influence on some of the Founders can be seen in Benjamin Franklin's suggestion at the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 that no high office in any branch of government should receive a salary, which is a suggestion Hume had made in his emendation of James Harrington's \"Oceana\".\nThe legacy of religious civil war in 18th-century Scotland, combined with the relatively recent memory of the 1715 and 1745 Jacobite risings, had fostered in Hume a distaste for enthusiasm and factionalism. These appeared to him to threaten the fragile and nascent political and social stability of a country that was deeply politically and religiously divided. Hume thought that society is best governed by a general and impartial system of laws; he is less concerned about the form of government that administers these laws, so long as it does so fairly. However, he also clarified that a republic must produce laws, while \"monarchy, when absolute, contains even something repugnant to law.\"\nHume expressed suspicion of attempts to reform society in ways that departed from long-established custom, and he counselled peoples not to resist their governments except in cases of the most egregious tyranny. However, he resisted aligning himself with either of Britain's two political parties, the Whigs and the Tories, explaining that \"my views of \"things\" are more conformable to Whig principles; my representations of \"persons\" to Tory prejudices\".\nThe scholar Jerry Z. Muller argues that Hume's political thoughts have characteristics that later became typical for American and British conservatism, which contain more positive views of capitalism than conservatism does elsewhere. Canadian philosopher Neil McArthur writes that Hume believed that we should try to balance our demands for liberty with the need for strong authority, without sacrificing either. McArthur characterises Hume as a \"precautionary conservative,\" whose actions would have been \"determined by prudential concerns about the consequences of change, which often demand we ignore our own principles about what is ideal or even legitimate.\" Hume supported the liberty of the press, and was sympathetic to democracy, when suitably constrained. American historian Douglass Adair has argued that Hume was a major inspiration for James Madison's writings, and the essay \"Federalist No. 10\" in particular.\nHume offered his view on the best type of society in an essay titled \"Idea of a Perfect Commonwealth\", which lays out what he thought was the best form of government. He hoped that \"in some future age, an opportunity might be afforded of reducing the theory to practice, either by a dissolution of some old government, or by the combination of men to form a new one, in some distant part of the world\". He defended a strict separation of powers, decentralisation, extending the franchise to anyone who held property of value and limiting the power of the clergy. The system of the Swiss militia was proposed as the best form of protection. Elections were to take place on an annual basis and representatives were to be unpaid. Political philosophers Leo Strauss and Joseph Cropsey, writing of Hume's thoughts about \"the wise statesman\", note that he \"will bear a reverence to what carries the marks of age.\" Also, if he wishes to improve a constitution, his innovations will take account of the \"ancient fabric\", in order not to disturb society.\nIn the political analysis of philosopher George Holland Sabine, the scepticism of Hume extended to the doctrine of government by consent. He notes that \"allegiance is a habit enforced by education and consequently as much a part of human nature as any other motive.\"\nIn the 1770s, Hume was critical of British policies toward the American colonies and advocated for American independence. He wrote in 1771 that \"our union with America\u2026in the nature of things, cannot long subsist.\"\nContributions to economic thought.\nHume expressed his economic views in his \"Political Discourses\", which were incorporated in \"Essays and Treatises\" as Part II of \"Essays, Moral and Political\". To what extent he was influenced by Adam Smith is difficult to assess; however, both of them had similar principles supported from historical events. At the same time Hume did not demonstrate concrete system of economic theory which could be observed in Smith's \"Wealth of Nations\". However, he introduced several new ideas around which the \"classical economics\" of the 18th century was built. Through his discussions on politics, Hume developed many ideas that are prevalent in the field of economics. This includes ideas on private property, inflation, and foreign trade. Referring to his essay \"Of the Balance of Trade\", economist Paul Krugman (2012) has remarked that \"David Hume created what I consider the first true economic model.\"\nIn contrast to Locke, Hume believes that private property is not a natural right. Hume argues it is justified, because resources are limited. Private property would be an unjustified, \"idle ceremonial,\" if all goods were unlimited and available freely. Hume also believed in an unequal distribution of property, because perfect equality would destroy the ideas of thrift and industry. Perfect equality would thus lead to impoverishment.\nDavid Hume anticipated modern monetarism. First, Hume contributed to the theory of quantity and of interest rate. Hume has been credited with being the first to prove that, on an abstract level, there is no quantifiable amount of nominal money that a country needs to thrive. He understood that there was a difference between \"nominal\" and \"real\" money.\nSecond, Hume has a theory of causation which fits in with the Chicago-school \"black box\" approach. According to Hume, cause and effect are related only through correlation. Hume shared the belief with modern monetarists that changes in the supply of money can affect consumption and investment.\nLastly, Hume was a vocal advocate of a stable private sector, though also having some non-monetarist aspects to his economic philosophy. Having a stated preference for rising prices, for instance, Hume considered government debt to be a sort of substitute for actual money, referring to such debt as \"a kind of paper credit.\" He also believed in heavy taxation, believing that it increases effort. Hume's economic approach evidently resembles his other philosophies, in that he does not choose one side indefinitely, but sees gray in the situation\nLegacy.\nDue to Hume's vast influence on contemporary philosophy, a large number of approaches in contemporary philosophy and cognitive science are today called \"Humean.\"\nThe writings of Thomas Reid, a Scottish philosopher and contemporary of Hume, were often critical of Hume's scepticism. Reid formulated his \"common sense\" philosophy, in part, as a reaction against Hume's views.\nHume influenced, and was influenced by, the Christian philosopher Joseph Butler. Hume was impressed by Butler's way of thinking about religion, and Butler may well have been influenced by Hume's writings.\nAttention to Hume's philosophical works grew after the German philosopher Immanuel Kant, in his \"Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics\" (1783), credited Hume with awakening him from his \"dogmatic slumber.\"\nAccording to Arthur Schopenhauer, \"there is more to be learned from each page of David Hume than from the collected philosophical works of Hegel, Herbart and Schleiermacher taken together.\"\nA. J. Ayer, while introducing his classic exposition of logical positivism in 1936, claimed that his views were \"the logical outcome of the empiricism of Berkeley and David Hume\".\nAlbert Einstein, in 1915, wrote that he was inspired by Hume's positivism when formulating his theory of special relativity.\nHume's problem of induction was also of fundamental importance to the philosophy of Karl Popper. In his autobiography, \"Unended Quest\", he wrote: \"Knowledge\u00a0... is \"objective\"; and it is hypothetical or conjectural. This way of looking at the problem made it possible for me to reformulate Hume's \"problem of induction\".\" This insight resulted in Popper's major work \"The Logic of Scientific Discovery\". In his \"Conjectures and Refutations\", he wrote that he \"approached the problem of induction through Hume\", since Hume was \"perfectly right in pointing out that induction cannot be logically justified\".\nHume's rationalism in religious subjects influenced, via German-Scottish theologian Johann Joachim Spalding, the German neology school and rational theology, and contributed to the transformation of German theology in the Age of Enlightenment. Hume pioneered a comparative history of religion, tried to explain various rites and traditions as being based on deception and challenged various aspects of rational and natural theology, such as the argument from design.\nDanish theologian and philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard adopted \"Hume's suggestion that the role of reason is not to make us wise but to reveal our ignorance,\" though taking it as a reason for the necessity of religious faith, or \"fideism\". The \"fact that Christianity is contrary to reason\u2026is the necessary precondition for true faith.\" Political theorist Isaiah Berlin, who has also pointed out the similarities between the arguments of Hume and Kierkegaard against rational theology, has written about Hume's influence on what Berlin calls the \"counter-Enlightenment\" and on German anti-rationalism. Berlin has also once said of Hume that \"no man has influenced the history of philosophy to a deeper or more disturbing degree.\"\nIn 2003, philosopher Jerry Fodor described Hume's \"Treatise\" as \"the founding document of cognitive science.\"\nHume engaged with contemporary intellectuals including Jean-Jacques Rousseau, James Boswell, and Adam Smith (who acknowledged Hume's influence on his economics and political philosophy).\nMorris and Brown (2019) write that Hume is \"generally regarded as one of the most important philosophers to write in English.\"\nIn September 2020, the David Hume Tower, a University of Edinburgh building, was renamed to 40 George Square; this was following a campaign led by students of the university to rename it, in objection to Hume's writings related to race."}

One of the Hollywood Ten, he refused to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1947 during the committee's investigation of alleged Communist influences in the motion picture industry.\nTrumbo, the other members of the Hollywood Ten, and hundreds of other professionals in the industry were blacklisted by Hollywood. He continued working clandestinely on major films, writing under pseudonyms or other authors' names. His uncredited work won two Academy Awards for Best Story: for \"Roman Holiday\" (1953), which was presented to a front writer, and for \"The Brave One\" (1956), which was awarded to a pseudonym used by Trumbo. When he was given public screen credit for both \"Exodus\" and \"Spartacus\" in 1960, it marked the beginning of the end of the Hollywood Blacklist for Trumbo and other affected screenwriters. He finally was given full credit by the Writers' Guild for \"Roman Holiday\" in 2011, nearly 60 years after the fact, and 35 years after his death.\nOrigins.\nTrumbo was born in Montrose, Colorado, on December 9, 1905, the son of Orus Bonham Trumbo and Maud (n\u00e9e Tillery) Trumbo. His family moved to Grand Junction, Colorado, in 1908.\nHis paternal immigrant ancestor, a Protestant of Swiss origin named Jacob Trumbo, settled in the colony of Virginia in 1736. Orus Trumbo worked variously as a shoe clerk and collection agent, never earning enough to keep the family far from poverty.\nTrumbo graduated from Grand Junction High School. While still in high school, he worked for Walter Walker as a cub reporter for the \"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel,\" covering courts, the high school, the mortuary and civic organizations. He attended the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1924 and 1925, working as a reporter for the \"Boulder Daily Camera\" and contributing to the school's humor magazine, yearbook, and newspaper. He was a member of Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity.\nIn 1924, Orus Trumbo relocated the family to California. Shortly after, he fell ill and died, leaving Dalton to support his mother and siblings. For nine years after his father died, Trumbo worked the night shift wrapping bread at a Los Angeles bakery and attended the University of California, Los Angeles (1926) and the University of Southern California (1928\u20131930). During this time, he wrote movie reviews, 88 short stories, and six novels, all of which were rejected for publication.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nTrumbo began his professional writing career in the early 1930s, when several of his articles and stories were published in mainstream magazines, including \"McCall's\", \"Vanity Fair\", the \"Hollywood Spectator\" and \"The Saturday Evening Post\". Trumbo was hired as managing editor of the \"Hollywood Spectator\" in 1934. Later he left the magazine to become a reader in the story department at Warner Bros. studio.\nHis first published novel, \"Eclipse\" (1935), was released during the Great Depression. Writing in the social realist style, Trumbo drew on his years in Grand Junction to portray a town and its people. The book was controversial in his hometown, where many people took issue with his fictional portrayal.\nTrumbo started working in movies in 1937 but continued writing prose. His anti-war novel \"Johnny Got His Gun\" won one of the early National Book Awards: the Most Original Book of 1939. It was inspired by an article Trumbo had read several years earlier: an account of a hospital visit by the Prince of Wales to a Canadian soldier who had lost all his limbs in World War I.\nDuring the late 1930s and early 1940s, Trumbo became one of Hollywood's highest-paid screenwriters, at about $4,000 per week while on assignment, and earning as much as $80,000 in one year. He worked on such films as \"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\" (1944), \"Our Vines Have Tender Grapes\" (1945), and \"Kitty Foyle\" (1940), for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.\nPolitical advocacy and blacklisting.\nAligned with the Communist Party USA before the 1940s, Trumbo was an isolationist. He joined the Communist Party in 1943, and remained active until 1947. He reaffiliated himself with the party in 1954. His novel \"The Remarkable Andrew\" featured the ghost of President Andrew Jackson appearing to caution the United States against getting involved in World War II and in support of the Nazi-Soviet pact.\nShortly after Operation Barbarossa, the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Trumbo and his publisher decided to suspend reprinting \"Johnny Got His Gun\" until the end of the war. During the war, Trumbo received letters from individuals \"denouncing Jews\" and using \"Johnny\" to support their arguments for \"an immediate negotiated peace\" with Nazi Germany; Trumbo reported these correspondents to the FBI. Trumbo regretted this decision, which he called \"foolish\". After two FBI agents showed up at his home, he understood that \"their interest lay not in the letters but in me\".\nIn a 1946 article titled \"The Russian Menace\" published in Rob Wagner's \"Script Magazine\", Trumbo wrote from the perspective of a post-World War II Russian citizen. He argued that Russians were likely fearful of the mass of U.S. military power that surrounded them, at a time when any sympathetic view toward Communist countries was viewed with suspicion. He ended the article by stating, \"If I were a Russian ... I would be alarmed, and I would petition my government to take measures at once against what would seem an almost certain blow aimed at my existence. This is how it must appear in Russia today\". He argued that the U.S. was a \"menace\" to Russia, rather than the more popular American view of Russia as the \"red menace\". According to author Kenneth Billingsley, Trumbo had bragged in \"The Daily Worker\" that Communist influence in Hollywood had prevented films from being made from anti-Communist books, such as Arthur Koestler's \"Darkness at Noon\" and \"The Yogi and the Commissar\".\nWilliam R. Wilkerson, publisher and founder of \"The Hollywood Reporter\", published a July 29, 1946, \"TradeView\" column entitled \"A Vote For Joe Stalin\". It named Trumbo and several others as Communist sympathizers, the first persons identified on what became known as \"Billy's Blacklist\". In October 1947, drawing upon these names, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) summoned Trumbo and nine others to testify for their investigation as to whether Communist agents and sympathizers had surreptitiously planted propaganda in U.S. films. The writers refused to give information about their own or any other person's involvement and were convicted for contempt of Congress. They appealed the conviction to the Supreme Court on First Amendment grounds and lost. Trumbo served eleven months in the federal penitentiary in Ashland, Kentucky, in 1950. In the 1976 documentary \"Hollywood On Trial\", Trumbo said: \"As far as I was concerned, it was a completely just verdict. I had contempt for that Congress and have had contempt for it ever since. And on the basis of guilt or innocence, I could never really complain very much. That this was a crime or misdemeanor was the complaint, my complaint.\"\nThe MPAA issued a statement that Trumbo and his compatriots would not be permitted to work in the industry unless they disavowed Communism under oath. After completing his sentence, Trumbo sold his ranch and moved his family to Mexico City with Hugo Butler and his wife Jean Rouverol, who had also been blacklisted. In Mexico, Trumbo wrote 30 scripts (under pseudonyms) for B-movie studios such as King Brothers Productions. In the case of \"Gun Crazy\" (1950), adapted from a short story by MacKinlay Kantor, Kantor agreed to be the front for Trumbo's screenplay. Trumbo's role in the screenplay was not revealed until 1992.\nDuring this blacklist period, Trumbo also wrote \"The Brave One\" (1956) for the King Brothers. Like \"Roman Holiday\", it received an Academy Award for Best Story he could not claim. The script was credited to Robert Rich, a name borrowed from a nephew of the producers. Trumbo recalled earning an average fee of $1,750 per film for 18 screenplays written in two years and said, \"None was very good\".\nHe published \"The Devil in the Book\", an analysis of the conviction of 14 California Smith Act defendants, in 1956. The statute set criminal penalties for advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government and required all non-citizen adult residents to register with the government.\nLater career.\nIngo Preminger, the brother of producer-director Otto Preminger, was Dalton Trumbo's agent. Otto Preminger hired Trumbo to write a screenplay for the film he intended to adapt from Leon Uris' 1958 novel \"Exodus\" when the script he had commissioned from Uris was deemed unusable. The producer-director decided to give Trumbo the screen credit. Shortly thereafter, actor Kirk Douglas announced Trumbo had written the screenplay for Stanley Kubrick's film \"Spartacus\" (also 1960), adapted from the 1951 novel by Howard Fast. With these actions, Preminger and Douglas helped end the power of the blacklist.\nTrumbo was reinstated into the Writers Guild of America, West and was credited on all subsequent scripts. The guild finally gave him full credit for the script of the 1953 film \"Roman Holiday\" in 2011. Trumbo directed the 1971 film adaptation of his novel \"Johnny Got His Gun\", starring Timothy Bottoms, Diane Varsi, Jason Robards and Donald Sutherland. One of the last films Trumbo wrote, \"Executive Action\" (1973), was based on the John F. Kennedy assassination. The Academy officially recognized Trumbo as the winner of the Oscar for the 1956 film \"The Brave One\" in 1975, presenting him with a statuette.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1938, Trumbo married Cleo Fincher, who was born in Fresno, California, on July 17, 1916, and had moved with her divorced mother and her brother and sister to Los Angeles. The Trumbos had three children: Nikola Trumbo (1939\u20132018), who became a psychotherapist; Christopher Trumbo (1940\u20132011), a filmmaker and screenwriter who became an expert on the Hollywood blacklist; and Melissa Trumbo (1945), known as Mitzi, a photographer. Mitzi Trumbo dated comedian Steve Martin when they were both in their early 20s, which is recounted in Martin's 2007 book \"Born Standing Up\". Martin wrote of her: \"Mitzi became my official photographer, and she snapped dozens of rolls of film, all to find the perfect publicity photo.\"\nCleo Trumbo died of natural causes at the age of 93 on October 9, 2009, at the home she shared with Mitzi Trumbo in Los Altos, California.\nDeath and legacy.\nTrumbo died in 1976, in Los Angeles of a heart attack at the age of 70. He donated his body to scientific research.\nIn 1993, Trumbo was posthumously awarded the Academy Award for writing \"Roman Holiday\" (1953). The screen credit and award were previously given to Ian McLellan Hunter, who had been a front for Trumbo. A new statue was made for this award because Hunter's son refused to hand over the one his father had received.\nIn 2003, Christopher Trumbo mounted an Off-Broadway play based on his father's letters, called \"Trumbo: Red, White and Blacklisted\", in which a wide variety of actors played his father during the run, including Nathan Lane, Tim Robbins, Brian Dennehy, Ed Harris, Chris Cooper and Gore Vidal. He adapted it as the documentary \"Trumbo\" (2007), which added archival footage and new interviews.\nA dramatization of Trumbo's life, also called \"Trumbo\", was released in November 2015. It starred Bryan Cranston in the title role and was directed by Jay Roach. For his portrayal of Trumbo, Cranston was nominated for Best Actor at the 88th Academy Awards.\nThe moving image collection of Trumbo is held at the Academy Film Archive and consists primarily of extensive 35\u00a0mm production materials relating to the 1971 anti-war film \"Johnny Got His Gun\". In 2016, more than a hundred years after his birth, Trumbo was honored by the installation of a statue of him in front of the Avalon Theater on Main Street in Grand Junction, Colorado, his home town. He was depicted writing a screenplay in a bathtub.\nTrumbo is featured in the 2024 biographical historical drama \"Reagan\" about U.S. president Ronald Reagan.

{"id": "7930", "revid": "7131173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7930", "title": "Delaware", "text": "Delaware ( ) is a state in the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic regions of the United States. It borders Maryland to its south and west, Pennsylvania to its north, New Jersey to its northeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to its east. The state's name derives from the adjacent Delaware Bay, which in turn was named after Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and the Colony of Virginia's first colonial-era governor.\nDelaware occupies the northeastern portion of the Delmarva Peninsula, and some islands and territory within the Delaware River. It is the second-smallest and sixth-least populous state, but also the sixth-most densely populated. Delaware's most populous city is Wilmington, and the state's capital is Dover, the second-most populous city in Delaware. The state is divided into three counties, the fewest number of counties of any of the 50 U.S. states; from north to south, the three counties are: New Castle County, Kent County, and Sussex County. The southern two counties, Kent and Sussex counties, historically have been predominantly agrarian economies. New Castle is more urbanized and is considered part of the Delaware Valley metropolitan statistical area that surrounds Philadelphia. Delaware is considered part of the Southern United States by the U.S. Census Bureau, but the state's geography, culture, and history are a hybrid of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern regions of the country.\nBefore the Delaware coastline was explored and developed by Europeans in the 16th century, the state was inhabited by several Native American tribes, including the Lenape in the north and Nanticoke in the south. The state was first colonized by Dutch traders at Zwaanendael, near present-day Lewes, Delaware, in 1631. Delaware was one of the Thirteen Colonies that participated in the American Revolution against Great Britain, which established the United States as an independent nation. On December 7, 1787, Delaware was the first state to ratify the Constitution of the United States, earning it the nickname \"The First State\".\nSince the turn of the 20th century, Delaware has become an onshore corporate haven whose corporate laws are deemed appealing to corporations; over half of all New York Stock Exchange-listed corporations and over three-fifths of the \"Fortune\" 500 are legally incorporated in Delaware. Over 90% of all U.S. based companies that went public in 2021 incorporated themselves in Delaware.\nEtymology.\nDelaware was named after its location on the Delaware Bay, which in turn derived its name from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr (1577\u20131618), the first governor of the Colony of Virginia. The Delaware people, a name used by Europeans for Lenape people Indigenous to the Delaware Valley, also derive their name from the same source.\nThe name \"de La Warr\" was derived from Sussex and is of Anglo-French origin. It came probably from a Norman lieu-dit \"La Guerre\". This toponymic likely derived from Latin \"ager\", the Breton \"gwern\" or from the Late Latin (fallow). The toponyms Gara, Gare, Gaire, (the sound [\u00e4] often mutated in [\u00e6]) also appear in historical texts cited by Lucien Musset, where the word \"ga(i)ra\" means gore. It could also be linked with a patronymic from the Old Norse \"verr\".\nHistory.\nNative Americans.\nBefore Delaware was settled by European colonists, the present-day state was home to the Eastern Algonquian tribes known as the Unami Lenape, or Delaware, who lived mostly along the coast, and the Nanticoke who occupied much of the southern Delmarva Peninsula. John Smith also shows two Iroquoian tribes, the Kuskarawock and Tockwogh, living north of the Nanticoke\u2014they may have held small portions of land in the western part of the state before migrating across the Chesapeake Bay. The Kuskarawocks were most likely the Tuscarora.\nThe Unami Lenape in the Delaware Valley were closely related to Munsee Lenape tribes along the Hudson River. They had a settled hunting and agricultural society, and they rapidly became middlemen in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their ancient enemy, the Minqua or Susquehannock. With the loss of their lands on the Delaware River and the destruction of the Minqua by the Iroquois of the Five Nations in the 1670s, the remnants of the Lenape who wished to remain identified as such left the region and moved over the Allegheny Mountains by the mid-18th century. Generally, those who did not relocate out of the state of Delaware were baptized, became Christian and were grouped together with other persons of color in official records and in the minds of their non-Native American neighbors.\nColonial Delaware.\nThe Dutch were the first Europeans to settle in present-day Delaware in the middle region by establishing a trading post at Zwaanendael, near the site of Lewes in 1631. Within a year, all the settlers were killed in a dispute with Native American tribes living in the area. In 1638, New Sweden, a Swedish trading post and colony, was established at Fort Christina (now in Wilmington) by Peter Minuit at the head of a group of Swedes, Finns and Dutch. The colony of New Sweden lasted 17 years. In 1651, the Dutch, reinvigorated by the leadership of Peter Stuyvesant, established a fort at present-day New Castle and, in 1655, they conquered the New Sweden colony, annexing it into the Dutch New Netherland. Only nine years later, in 1664, the Dutch were conquered by a fleet of English ships by Sir Robert Carr under the direction of James, the Duke of York. Fighting off a prior claim by Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, Proprietor of Maryland, the Duke passed his somewhat dubious ownership on to William Penn in 1682. Penn strongly desired access to the sea for his Pennsylvania province and leased what then came to be known as the \"Lower Counties on the Delaware\" from the Duke.\nPenn established representative government and briefly combined his two possessions under one General Assembly in 1682. However, by 1704 the province of Pennsylvania had grown so large their representatives wanted to make decisions without the assent of the Lower Counties, and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own, one at Philadelphia, and the other at New Castle. Penn and his heirs remained proprietors of both and always appointed the same person Governor for their province of Pennsylvania and their territory of the Lower Counties. The fact that Delaware and Pennsylvania shared the same governor was not unique; from 1703 to 1738, New York and New Jersey shared a governor. Massachusetts and New Hampshire also shared a governor for some time.\nDependent in early years on indentured labor, Delaware imported more slaves as the number of English immigrants decreased with better economic conditions in England. The colony became a slave society and cultivated tobacco as a cash crop, although English immigrants continued to arrive.\nAmerican Revolution.\nLike the other middle colonies, the Lower Counties on the Delaware initially showed little enthusiasm for a break with Britain. The citizenry had a good relationship with the Proprietary government, and generally were allowed more independence of action in their Colonial Assembly than in other colonies. Merchants at the port of Wilmington had trading ties with the British.\nNew Castle lawyer Thomas McKean denounced the Stamp Act in the strongest terms, and Kent County native John Dickinson became the \"Penman of the Revolution\". Anticipating the Declaration of Independence, Patriot leaders Thomas McKean and Caesar Rodney convinced the Colonial Assembly to declare itself separated from British and Pennsylvania rule on June 15, 1776. The person best representing Delaware's majority, George Read, could not bring himself to vote for a Declaration of Independence. Only the dramatic overnight ride of Caesar Rodney gave the delegation the votes needed to cast Delaware's vote for independence.\nInitially led by John Haslet, Delaware provided one of the premier regiments in the Continental Army, known as the \"Delaware Blues\" and nicknamed the \"Blue Hen's Chicks\". In August 1777 General Sir William Howe led a British army through Delaware on his way to a victory at the Battle of Brandywine and capture of the city of Philadelphia. The only real engagement on Delaware soil was the Battle of Cooch's Bridge, fought on September 3, 1777, at Cooch's Bridge in New Castle County, although there was a minor Loyalist rebellion in 1778.\nFollowing the Battle of Brandywine, Wilmington was occupied by the British, and State President John McKinly was taken prisoner. The British remained in control of the Delaware River for much of the rest of the war, disrupting commerce and providing encouragement to an active Loyalist portion of the population, particularly in Sussex County. Because the British promised slaves of rebels freedom for fighting with them, escaped slaves flocked north to join their lines.\nFollowing the American Revolution, statesmen from Delaware were among the leading proponents of a strong central United States with equal representation for each state.\nSlavery and race.\nMany colonial settlers came to Delaware from Maryland and Virginia, where the population had been increasing rapidly. The economies of these colonies were chiefly based on labor-intensive tobacco and increasingly dependent on African slaves because of a decline in working class immigrants from England. Most of the English colonists had arrived as indentured servants (contracted for a fixed period to pay for their passage), and in the early years the line between servant and slave was fluid.\nMost of the free African-American families in Delaware before the Revolution had migrated from Maryland to find more affordable land. They were descendants chiefly of relationships or marriages between white servant women and enslaved, servant or free African or African-American men. Under slavery law, children took the social status of their mothers, so children born to white women were free, regardless of their paternity, just as children born to enslaved women were born into slavery. As the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in England, more slaves were imported for labor and the caste lines hardened.\nBy the end of the colonial period, the number of enslaved people in Delaware began to decline. Shifts in the agriculture economy from tobacco to mixed farming resulted in less need for slaves' labor. In addition local Methodists and Quakers encouraged slaveholders to free their slaves following the American Revolution, and many did so in a surge of individual manumissions for idealistic reasons. By 1810, three-quarters of all blacks in Delaware were free. When John Dickinson freed his slaves in 1777, he was Delaware's largest slave owner with 37 slaves. By 1860, the largest slaveholder owned 16 slaves.\nAlthough attempts to abolish slavery failed by narrow margins in the legislature, in practical terms the state had mostly ended the practice. By the 1860 census on the verge of the Civil War, 91.7% of the black population were free; 1,798 were slaves, as compared to 19,829 \"free colored persons\".\nAn independent black denomination was chartered in 1813 by freed slave Peter Spencer as the \"Union Church of Africans\". This followed the 1793 establishment in Philadelphia of the African Methodist Episcopal Church by Richard Allen, which had ties to the Methodist Episcopal Church until 1816. Spencer built a church in Wilmington for the new denomination. This was renamed as the African Union First Colored Methodist Protestant Church and Connection, more commonly known as the A.U.M.P. Church. In 1814, Spencer called for the first annual gathering, known as the Big August Quarterly, which continues to draw members of this denomination and their descendants together in a religious and cultural festival.\nDelaware voted against secession on January 3, 1861, and so remained in the Union. While most Delaware citizens who fought in the war served in the regiments of the state, some served in companies on the Confederate side in Maryland and Virginia Regiments. Delaware is notable for being the only slave state from which no Confederate regiments or militia groups were assembled. Delaware essentially freed the few slaves who were still in bondage shortly after the Civil War but rejected the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution; the 13th Amendment was rejected on February 8, 1865, the 14th Amendment was rejected on February 8, 1867, and the 15th Amendment was rejected on March 18, 1869. Delaware officially ratified the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments on February 12, 1901, decades after they had already come into force.\nReconstruction and industrialization.\nDuring the Reconstruction Era that followed the Civil War, Democratic Redeemer governments led by the South's Bourbon aristocracy continued to dominate the region and imposed explicitly white supremacist regimes in the former slave states. The Delaware legislature declared Black people to be second-class citizens in 1866, and restricted their voting rights despite the 15th Amendment, ensuring continued Democratic success in the state throughout most of the 19th century. Fearful that the 1875 Civil Rights Act passed by Congress might establish racial equality, Delaware legislators passed Jim Crow laws that mandated segregation in public facilities. The state's educational system was segregated by operation of law. Delaware's segregation was written into the state constitution, which, while providing at Article X, Section 2, that \"no distinction shall be made on account of race or color\", nonetheless required that \"separate schools for white and colored children shall be maintained.\"\nBeginning in the late 19th century, the Wilmington area grew into a manufacturing center. Investment in manufacturing in the city grew from $5.5\u00a0million in 1860 to $44\u00a0million in 1900. The most notable manufacturer in the state was the chemical company DuPont, which to this day is heavily credited with making the state what it is today in many ways. Because of Wilmington's growth, local politicians from the city and New Castle County pressured the state government to adopt a new constitution providing the north with more representation. However, the subsequent 1897 constitution did not proportionally represent the north and continued to give the southern counties disproportionate influence.\nAs manufacturing expanded, businesses became major players in state affairs and funders of politicians through families such as the Du Ponts. Republican John Addicks attempted to buy a US Senate seat multiple times in a rivalry with the Du Ponts until the passage of the 17th Amendment. The allegiance of industries with the Republican party allowed them to gain control of the state's governorship throughout most of the 20th century. The GOP ensured black people could vote because of their general support for Republicans and thus undid restrictions on Black suffrage.\nDelaware benefited greatly from World War I because of the state's large gunpowder industry. DuPont, the most dominant business in the state by WWI, produced an estimated 40% of all gunpowder used by the Allies during the war. It produced nylon in the state after the war and began investments into General Motors. Additionally, the company invested heavily in the expansion of public schools in the state and colleges such as the University of Delaware in the 1910s and 1920s. This included primary and secondary schools for Black people and women. Delaware suffered less during the Great Depression than other states, but the depression spurred further migration from the rural south to urban areas.\nWorld War II to present.\nLike in World War I, the state enjoyed a big stimulus to its gunpowder and shipyard industries in World War II. New job opportunities during and after the war in the Wilmington area coaxed Black people from the southern counties to move to the city. The proportion of blacks constituting the city's population rose from 15% in 1950 to over 50% by 1980. The surge of Black migrants to the north sparked white flight, in which middle class whites moved from the city to suburban areas, leading to \"de facto\" segregation of Northern Delaware's society. In the 1940s and 1950s, Delaware attempted to integrate its schools, although the last segregated school in the state did not close until 1970. The University of Delaware admitted its first black student in 1948, and local courts ruled that primary schools had to be integrated. Delaware's integration efforts partially inspired the US Supreme Court's decision in \"Brown v. Board of Education\", which found racial segregation in United States public schools to be unconstitutional. The result of the \"Brown\" ruling was that Delaware became fully integrated, albeit with time and much effort.\nIn October 1954, the city of Milford became the scene of one of the country's first pro-segregation boycotts after eleven Black students were enrolled in the previously all-white Milford High School. Mass protests continued in Milford; the school board eventually ceded to the protestors, expelling the Black students. The ensuing unrest, which included cross burnings, rallies, and pro-segregation demonstrations, contributed to desegregation in most of Southern Delaware being delayed for another ten years. Sussex County did not start closing or integrating its segregated schools until 1965, 11 years after the \"Brown\" ruling. Throughout the state, integration only encouraged more white flight, and poor economic conditions for the black population led to some violence during the 1960s. Riots broke out in Wilmington in 1967 and again in 1968 in response to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr, after which the National Guard occupied the city for nine months to prevent further violence.\nSince WWII, the state has been generally economically prosperous and enjoyed relatively high per capita income because of its location between major cities like Philadelphia, New York, and Washington, DC. Its population grew rapidly, particularly in the suburbs in the north where New Castle county became an extension of the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Americans, including migrants from Puerto Rico, and immigrants from Latin America flocked to the state. By 1990, only 50% of Delaware's population consisted of natives to the state.\nGeography.\nDelaware is long and ranges from across, with a land area of and a total area of , making it the second-smallest state by either metric in the United States after Rhode Island. Delaware is bounded to the north by Pennsylvania; to the east by the Delaware River, Delaware Bay, New Jersey, and the Atlantic Ocean; and to the west and south by Maryland. Small portions of Delaware are also situated on the eastern side of the Delaware River sharing land boundaries with New Jersey. The state of Delaware, together with the Eastern Shore counties of Maryland and two counties of Virginia, form the Delmarva Peninsula, which stretches down the Mid-Atlantic Coast.\nThe definition of the northern boundary of the state is unusual. Most of the boundary between Delaware and Pennsylvania was originally defined by an arc extending from the cupola of the courthouse in the city of New Castle. This boundary is often referred to as the Twelve-Mile Circle. Although the Twelve-Mile Circle is often claimed to be the only territorial boundary in the U.S. that is a true arc, the Mexican boundary with Texas includes several arcs, and many cities in the South (such as Plains, Georgia) also have circular boundaries.\nThis border extends all the way east to the low-tide mark on the New Jersey shore, then continues south along the shoreline until it again reaches the arc in the south; then the boundary continues in a more conventional way in the middle of the main channel (thalweg) of the Delaware River.\nOn the west, Delaware and Maryland are mostly separated by a line running from the midpoint of the Transpeninsular Line, going slightly west of due north up to its tangent point on the Twelve-Mile Circle. The border follows the Circle for a short distance and then continues in a straight line due north until reaching the southern border of Pennsylvania. The Wedge of land between the northwest part of the arc and the Maryland border was claimed by both Delaware and Pennsylvania until 1921, when Delaware's claim was confirmed.\nTopography.\nDelaware is on a level plain, with the lowest mean elevation of any state in the nation. Its highest elevation, located at Ebright Azimuth, near Concord High School, is less than above sea level. The northernmost part of the state is part of the Piedmont Plateau with hills and rolling surfaces.\nThe Atlantic Seaboard fall line approximately follows the Robert Kirkwood Highway between Newark and Wilmington; south of this road is the Atlantic Coastal Plain with flat, sandy, and, in some parts, swampy ground. A ridge about high extends along the western boundary of the state and separates the watersheds that feed Delaware River and Bay to the east and the Chesapeake Bay to the west.\nClimate.\nSince almost all of Delaware is a part of the Atlantic coastal plain, the effects of the ocean moderate its climate. The state lies in the humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Cfa\") zone. Despite its small size (roughly from its northernmost to southernmost points), there is significant variation in mean temperature and amount of snowfall between Sussex County and New Castle County. Moderated by the Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Bay, the southern portion of the state has a milder climate and a longer growing season than the northern portion of the state.\nSummers are long, hot, and humid in Delaware, often with intense (but brief) late day thundershowers. Delaware averages 2,300 hrs of sunshine annually (higher than the USA average). Winters are modestly cool to cold in northern Delaware, and cool to mild in southern Delaware. The normal seasonal snowfall ranges from about 20.0 inches in Wilmington to only 10.0 inches in Lewes. In many winters no snow will fall in coastal Delaware. Northern Delaware falls into USDA Garden Zone 7a, while southern and coastal areas fall into USDA zone 7b and 8a. The milder climate in southern Delaware allows for subtropical flora such as the windmill palm, needle palm, and dwarf palmetto.\nDelaware's all-time record high of was recorded at Millsboro on July 21, 1930. The all-time record low of was also recorded at Millsboro, on January 17, 1893. The hardiness zones are 7B and 8A at the Delaware Beaches.\nEnvironment.\nThe transitional climate of Delaware supports a wide variety of vegetation. In the northern third of the state are found Northeastern coastal forests and mixed oak forests typical of the northeastern United States. In the southern two-thirds of the state are found Middle Atlantic coastal forests. Trap Pond State Park, along with areas in other parts of Sussex County, for example, support the northernmost stands of bald cypress trees in North America.\nEnvironmental management.\nDelaware provides government subsidy support for the clean-up of property \"lightly contaminated\" by hazardous waste, the proceeds for which come from a tax on wholesale petroleum sales.\nMunicipalities.\nWilmington is the state's most populous city (70,635) and its economic hub. It is located within commuting distance of both Philadelphia and Baltimore. Dover is the state capital and the second most populous city (38,079).\nUnincorporated places.\nThe table below lists the ten largest municipalities in the state based on the 2020 United States census.\nDemographics.\nThe United States Census Bureau determined that the population of Delaware was 989,948 on April 1, 2020, an increase from the 2010 census figure of 897,934.\nDelaware's history as a border state has led it to exhibit characteristics of both the Northern and the Southern regions of the United States. Generally, the rural Southern (or \"Slower Lower\") regions of Delaware below the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal embody a Southern culture, while densely-populated Northern Delaware above the canal\u2014particularly Wilmington, a part of the Philadelphia metropolitan area\u2014has more in common with that of the Northeast and the North. The U.S. Census Bureau designates Delaware as one of the South Atlantic States, but it is commonly associated with the Mid-Atlantic States or northeastern United States by other federal agencies, the media, and some residents.\nDelaware is the sixth most densely populated state, with a population density of 442.6 people per square mile, 356.4 per square mile more than the national average, and ranking 45th in population. Delaware is one of five U.S. states (Maine, Vermont, West Virginia, Wyoming) that do not have a single city with a population over 100,000 as of the 2010 census. The center of population of Delaware is in New Castle County, in the town of Townsend.\nAccording to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 2,369 homeless people in Delaware.\nRace and ethnicity.\nAccording to the 2010 United States census, the racial composition of the state was 68.9% White American (65.3% Non-Hispanic White, 3.6% White Hispanic), 21.4% Black or African American, 0.5% American Indian and Alaska Native, 3.2% Asian American, 0.0% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 3.4% some other race, and 2.7% of multiracial origin. People of Hispanic or Latino origin, of any race, made up 8.2% of the population.\nThe 2022 American Community Survey estimated the state had a racial and ethnic makeup of 60.6% non-Hispanic whites, 23.6% Black or African American, 0.7% American Indian or Alaska Native, 4.2% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 2.9% multiracial, and 10.1% Hispanic or Latin American of any race.\nIn the Native American community, the state has a Native American group, called in their own language Lenape, which was influential in the colonial period of the United States and is today headquartered in Cheswold, Kent County, Delaware. A band of the Nanticoke tribe of American Indians today resides in Sussex County and is headquartered in Millsboro, Sussex County, Delaware.\nDelaware's population mainly consisted of people from the British Isles, African slaves, Germans and a few remaining Native Americans during the colonial era. Irish, Germans, Italians, Poles, and Russian Jewish immigrants were attracted by the industries in the Wilmington area. In the late 20th century a Puerto Rican community formed in Wilmington. Guatemalan people migrated to Sussex county to work in Delaware's poultry industry. A group of Native Americans in Delaware of mixed ethnicity, the Moors, live in Cheswold. The descendants of the Nanticoke people live around Millsboro. There is also a small numbers of Asians in New Castle county who work as scientific and engineering professionals.\nThe top countries of origin for Delaware's immigrants in 2018 were Mexico, India, Guatemala, China, and Jamaica.\nBirth data.\n\"Note: Births in table do not add up because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.\"\nLanguages.\nIn 2000, 91% of Delaware residents of age5 and older spoke only English at home; 5% spoke Spanish. French was the third most spoken language, used by 0.7% of the population, followed by Chinese (0.5%) and German (0.5%). Legislation has been proposed in both the House and the Senate in Delaware to designate English as the official language. Neither bill was passed in the legislature.\nSexual orientation.\nA 2012 Gallup poll found that Delaware's proportion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender adults stood at 3.4% of the population. This constitutes a total LGBT adult population estimate of 23,698 people. The number of same-sex couple households in 2010 stood at 2,646. This grew by 41.65% from a decade earlier. On July 1, 2013, same-sex marriage was legalized, and all civil unions were converted into marriages.\nReligion.\nThe predominant religion practiced in Delaware is Christianity. A 2014 estimate by the Pew Research Center found that members of Protestant churches accounted for almost half of the population, though the Roman Catholic Church was the largest single denomination in the state. By 2020, the Public Religion Research Institute determined 61% of the population was Christian. In 2022, the Public Religion Research Institute's survey revealed 60% were Christian, followed by Jews (3%), Hindus (1%), and New Agers (1%).\nThe Association of Religion Data Archives reported in 2010 that the three largest Christian denominational groups in Delaware by number of adherents are the Catholic Church at 182,532 adherents, the United Methodist Church with 53,656 members reported, and non-denominational evangelical Protestants, who numbered 22,973. In 2020, the Association of Religion Data Archives reported the largest Christian denominations were the Catholic Church with 197,094; non-denominational Protestants with 49,392, and United Methodists with 39,959.\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilmington and the Episcopal Diocese of Delaware oversee the parishes within their denominations. The A.U.M.P. Church, the oldest African-American denomination in the nation, was founded in Wilmington. It still has a substantial presence in the state. Reflecting new immigrant populations, an Islamic mosque has been built in the Ogletown area, and a Hindu temple in Hockessin.\nDelaware is home to an Amish community which resides west of Dover in Kent County, consisting of nine church districts and about 1,650 people. The Amish first settled in Kent County in 1915. In recent years, increasing development has led to the decline in the number of Amish living in the community.\nA 2012 survey of religious attitudes in the United States found that 34% of Delaware residents considered themselves \"moderately religious\", 33% \"very religious\", and 33% as \"non-religious\". At the 2014 Pew Research survey, 23% of the population were irreligious; the 2020 Public Religion Research Institute's survey determined 31% of the population were irreligious. In 2022, the same study showed 33% of the population as irreligious.\nEconomy.\nAffluence.\nAccording to a 2020 study by Kiplinger, Delaware had the 17th most millionaires per capita in the United States; altogether, there were 25,937 such individuals. The median income for Delaware households as of 2020 was $64,805.\nAgriculture.\nDelaware's agricultural output consists of poultry, nursery stock, soybeans, dairy products and corn.\nIndustries.\n, the state's unemployment rate was 3.7%.\nThe state's largest employers are:\nIndustrial decline.\nSince the mid-2000s, Delaware has seen the departure of the state's automotive manufacturing industry (General Motors Wilmington Assembly and Chrysler Newark Assembly), the corporate buyout of a major bank holding company (MBNA), the departure of the state's steel industry (Evraz Claymont Steel), the bankruptcy of a fiber mill (National Vulcanized Fiber), and the diminishing presence of AstraZeneca in Wilmington.\nIn late 2015, DuPont announced that 1,700 employees, nearly a third of its footprint in Delaware, would be laid off in early 2016. The merger of E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. and Dow Chemical Company into DowDuPont took place on September 1, 2017.\nIncorporation in Delaware.\nMore than half of all U.S. publicly traded companies, and 63% of the Fortune 500, are incorporated in Delaware. The state's attractiveness as a corporate haven is largely because of its business-friendly corporation law. Franchise taxes on Delaware corporations supply about a fifth of the state's revenue. Although \"USA (Delaware)\" ranked as the world's most opaque jurisdiction on the Tax Justice Network's 2009 Financial Secrecy Index, the same group's 2011 Index ranks the U.S. fifth and does not specify Delaware. In Delaware, there are more than a million registered corporations, meaning there are more corporations than people.\nFood and drink.\n stipulates that alcoholic liquor be sold only in specifically licensed establishments, and only between 9:00a.m. and 1:00a.m. Until 2003, Delaware was among the several states enforcing blue laws and banned the sale of liquor on Sunday.\nMedia.\nNewspapers.\nTwo daily newspapers are based in Delaware, the \"Delaware State News\", based in Dover and covering the two southern counties, and \"The News Journal\" covering Wilmington and northern Delaware. The state is also served by several weekly, monthly and online publications.\nTelevision.\nNo standalone television stations are based solely in Delaware. The northern part of the state is served by network stations in Philadelphia and the southern part by network stations in Salisbury, Maryland. Philadelphia's ABC affiliate, WPVI-TV, maintains a news bureau in downtown Wilmington. Salisbury's CBS affiliate, WBOC-TV, maintains bureaus in Dover and Milton. Three Philadelphia-market stations\u2014PBS member WHYY-TV, Ion affiliate WPPX, and MeTV affiliate WDPN-TV\u2014all have Wilmington as their city of license, but maintain transmitters at the market antenna farm in Roxborough, Philadelphia and do not produce any Delaware-centric programming.\nRadio.\nThere are a numerous radio stations licensed in Delaware. WDDE 91.1 FM, WDEL 1150AM, WHGE-LP 95.3 FM, WILM 1450 AM, WVCW 99.5, WMPH 91.7 FM, WSTW 93.7 FM, WTMC 1380 AM and WWTX 1290AM are licensed from Wilmington. WRDX 92.9 FM is licensed from Smyrna. WDOV 1410AM, WDSD 94.7 FM and WRTX 91.7 FM are licensed from Dover.\nTourism.\nDelaware is home to First State National Historical Park, a National Park Service unit composed of historic sites across the state including the New Castle Court House, Green, and Sheriff's House, Dover Green, Beaver Valley, Fort Christina, Old Swedes' Church, John Dickinson Plantation, and the Ryves Holt House. Delaware has several museums, , , , , and other .\nRehoboth Beach, together with the towns of Lewes, Dewey Beach, Bethany Beach, South Bethany, and Fenwick Island, comprise Delaware's beach resorts. Rehoboth Beach often bills itself as \"The Nation's Summer Capital\" because it is a frequent summer vacation destination for Washington, D.C., residents as well as visitors from Maryland, Virginia, and in lesser numbers, Pennsylvania. Vacationers are drawn for many reasons, including the town's charm, artistic appeal, nightlife, and tax-free shopping. According to SeaGrant Delaware, the Delaware beaches generate $6.9billion annually and over $711million in tax revenue.\nDelaware is home to several festivals, fairs, and events. Some of the more notable festivals are the Riverfest held in Seaford, the World Championship Punkin Chunkin formerly held at various locations throughout the state since 1986, the Rehoboth Beach Chocolate Festival, the Bethany Beach Jazz Funeral to mark the end of summer, the Apple Scrapple Festival held in Bridgeville, the Clifford Brown Jazz Festival in Wilmington, the Rehoboth Beach Jazz Festival, the Sea Witch Halloween Festival and Parade in Rehoboth Beach, the Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival, the Nanticoke Indian Pow Wow in Oak Orchard, Firefly Music Festival, and the Return Day Parade held after every election in Georgetown.\nIn 2015, tourism in Delaware generated $3.1billion, which makes up five percent of the state's GDP. Delaware saw 8.5million visitors in 2015, with the tourism industry employing 41,730 people, making it the 4th largest private employer in the state. Major origin markets for Delaware tourists include Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York City, Washington, D.C., and Harrisburg, with 97% of tourists arriving to the state by car and 75% of tourists coming from a distance of or less.\nDelaware is also home to two large sporting venues. Dover Motor Speedway is a race track in Dover, and Frawley Stadium in Wilmington is the home of the Wilmington Blue Rocks, a Minor League Baseball team that is currently affiliated with the Washington Nationals.\nEducation.\nIn the early 1920s, Pierre S. du Pont served as president of the state board of education. At the time, state law prohibited money raised from white taxpayers from being used to support the state's schools for black children. Appalled by the condition of the black schools, du Pont donated four million dollars to construct 86 new school buildings.\nDelaware was the origin of \"Belton v. Gebhart\" (1952), one of the four cases which were combined into \"Brown v. Board of Education\", the Supreme Court of the United States decision that led to the end of officially segregated public schools. Significantly, \"Belton\" was the only case in which the state court found for the plaintiffs, thereby ruling that segregation is unconstitutional.\nUnlike many states, Delaware's educational system is centralized in a state Superintendent of Education, with local school boards retaining control over taxation and some curriculum decisions. This centralized system, combined with the small size of the state, likely contributed to Delaware becoming the first state, after completion of a three-year, $30million program ending in 1999, to wire every K-12 classroom in the state to the Internet.\n, the Delaware Department of Education had authorized the founding of 25 charter schools in the state, one of them being all-girls.\nAll teachers in the State's public school districts are unionized. , none of the State's charter schools are members of a teachers union. One of the State's teachers' unions is Delaware State Education Association (DSEA).\nTransportation.\nThe transportation system in Delaware is under the governance and supervision of the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT). Funding for DelDOT projects is drawn, in part, from the Delaware Transportation Trust Fund, established in 1987 to help stabilize transportation funding; the availability of the Trust led to a gradual separation of DelDOT operations from other Delaware state operations. DelDOT manages programs such as a Delaware Adopt-a-Highway program, major road route snow removal, traffic control infrastructure (signs and signals), toll road management, Delaware Division of Motor Vehicles, the Delaware Transit Corporation (branded as \"DART First State\", the state government public transportation organization), and others.\nIn 2009, DelDOT maintained 13,507 lane-miles, totaling 89 percent of the state's public roadway system, the rest being under the supervision of individual municipalities. This far exceeds the national average (20 percent) for state department of transportation maintenance responsibility.\nRoads.\nOne major branch of the U.S. Interstate Highway System, Interstate95 (I-95), crosses Delaware southwest-to-northeast across New Castle County. Two Auxiliary Interstate Highway routes are also located in the state. Interstate 495 (I-495) is an eastern bypass of Wilmington. Interstate 295 (I-295) is a bypass of Philadelphia which begins south of Wilmington. In addition to Interstate highways, there are six U.S. highways that serve Delaware: U.S.9, U.S.13, U.S.40, U.S.113, U.S.202, and U.S.301. There are also several state highways that cross the state of Delaware; a few of them include DE1, DE9, and DE404. U.S.13 and DE1 are primary north\u2013south highways connecting Wilmington and Pennsylvania with Maryland, with DE1 serving as the main route between Wilmington and the Delaware beaches. DE9 is a north\u2013south highway connecting Dover and Wilmington via a scenic route along the Delaware Bay. U.S.40 is a primary east\u2013west route, connecting Maryland with New Jersey. DE404 is another primary east\u2013west highway connecting the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in Maryland with the Delaware beaches. The state also operates three toll highways, the Delaware Turnpike, which is I-95, between Maryland and New Castle; the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway, which is DE1, between Wilmington and Dover; and the U.S. 301 toll road between the Maryland border and DE1 in New Castle County.\nA bicycle route, Delaware Bicycle Route\u00a01, spans the north\u2013south length of the state from the Maryland border in Fenwick Island to the Pennsylvania border north of Montchanin. It is the first of several signed bike routes planned in Delaware.\nDelaware has about 875 bridges, 95 percent of which are under the supervision of DelDOT. About 30 percent of all Delaware bridges were built before 1950, and about 60 percent of the number are included in the National Bridge Inventory. Some bridges not under DelDOT supervision includes the four bridges on the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, which are under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Delaware Memorial Bridge, which is under the bi-state Delaware River and Bay Authority.\nIt has been noted that the tar and chip composition of secondary roads in Sussex County makes them more prone to deterioration than are the asphalt roadways in almost the rest of the state. Among these roads, Sussex (county road) 236 is among the most problematic.\nFerries.\nThree ferries operate in the state of Delaware:\nRail and bus.\nAmtrak has two stations in Delaware along the Northeast Corridor; the relatively quiet Newark Rail Station in Newark, and the busier Wilmington Station in Wilmington. The Northeast Corridor is also served by SEPTA's Wilmington/Newark Line, part of SEPTA Regional Rail, which serves Claymont, Wilmington, Churchmans Crossing, and Newark.\nTwo Class I railroads, Norfolk Southern and CSX, provide freight rail service in northern New Castle County. Norfolk Southern provides freight service along the Northeast Corridor and to industrial areas in Edgemoor, New Castle, and Delaware City. CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision passes through northern New Castle County parallel to the Amtrak Northeast Corridor. Multiple short-line railroads provide freight service in Delaware. The Delmarva Central Railroad operates the most trackage of the short-line railroads, running from an interchange with Norfolk Southern in Porter south through Dover, Harrington, and Seaford to Delmar, with another line running from Harrington to Frankford and branches from Ellendale to Milton and from Georgetown to Gravel Hill. The Delmarva Central Railroad connects with the Maryland and Delaware Railroad, which serves local customers in Sussex County. CSX connects with the freight/heritage operation, the Wilmington and Western Railroad, based in Wilmington and the East Penn Railroad, which operates a line from Wilmington to Coatesville, Pennsylvania.\nThe last north\u2013south passenger trains through the main part of Delaware was the Pennsylvania Railroad's local Wilmington-Delmar train in 1965. This was a successor to the \"Del-Mar-Va Express\" and \"Cavalier\", which had run from Philadelphia through the state's interior, to the end of the Delmarva Peninsula until the mid-1950s.\nThe DART First State public transportation system was named \"Most Outstanding Public Transportation System\" in 2003 by the American Public Transportation Association. Coverage of the system is broad within northern New Castle County with close association to major highways in Kent and Sussex counties. The system includes bus, subsidized passenger rail operated by Philadelphia transit agency SEPTA, and subsidized taxi and paratransit modes. The paratransit system, consisting of a statewide door-to-door bus service for the elderly and disabled, has been described by a Delaware state report as \"the most generous paratransit system in the United States\". , fees for the paratransit service have not changed since 1988.\nAir.\n, Delaware is served exclusively by Avelo Airlines out of Wilmington Airport, launching five routes to Florida on February 1. This put an end to an eight-month period during which Delaware had no scheduled air service, one of several since 1991. Various airlines had served Wilmington Airport, the latest departure being Frontier Airlines in June 2022.\nDelaware is centrally situated in the Northeast megalopolis region of cities along I-95. Therefore, Delaware commercial airline passengers most frequently use Philadelphia International Airport (PHL), Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI) and Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD) for domestic and international transit. Residents of Sussex County will also use Wicomico Regional Airport (SBY), as it is located less than from the Delaware border. Atlantic City International Airport (ACY), Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) are also within a radius of New Castle County.\nOther general aviation airports in Delaware include Summit Airport near Middletown, Delaware Airpark near Cheswold, and Delaware Coastal Airport near Georgetown.\nDover Air Force Base, one of the largest in the country, is home to the 436th Airlift Wing and the 512th Airlift Wing. In addition to its other responsibilities in the Air Mobility Command, it serves as the entry point and mortuary for U.S. military personnel (and some civilians) who die overseas.\nLaw and government.\nDelaware's fourth and current constitution, adopted in 1897, provides for executive, judicial and legislative branches.\nLegislative branch.\nThe Delaware General Assembly consists of a House of Representatives with 41 members and a Senate with 21 members. It sits in Dover, the state capital. Representatives are elected to two-year terms, while senators are elected to four-year terms. The Senate confirms judicial and other nominees appointed by the governor.\nDelaware's U.S. Senators are Lisa Blunt Rochester (Democrat) and Chris Coons (Democrat). Delaware's single U.S. Representative is Sarah McBride (Democrat).\nJudicial branch.\nThe Delaware Constitution establishes a number of courts:\nMinor non-constitutional courts include the Justice of the Peace Courts and Aldermen's Courts.\nSignificantly, Delaware has one of the few remaining Courts of Chancery in the nation, which has jurisdiction over equity cases, the vast majority of which are corporate disputes, many relating to mergers and acquisitions. The Court of Chancery and the Delaware Supreme Court have developed a worldwide reputation for rendering concise opinions concerning corporate law which generally (but not always) grant broad discretion to corporate boards of directors and officers. In addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law, which forms the basis of the Courts' opinions, is widely regarded as giving great flexibility to corporations to manage their affairs. For these reasons, Delaware is considered to have the most business-friendly legal system in the United States; therefore a great number of companies are incorporated in Delaware, including 60% of the companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nDelaware was the last U.S. state to use judicial corporal punishment, in 1952.\nExecutive branch.\nThe executive branch is headed by the Governor of Delaware. The current governor is Matt Meyer (Democrat), who took office January 21, 2025. The lieutenant governor is Kyle Evans Gay. The governor presents a \"State of the State\" speech to a joint session of the Delaware legislature annually.\nThe executive branch also consists of the Attorney General of Delaware currently held by Kathy Jennings, the State Treasurer currently held by Colleen Davis, the Auditor of Accounts currently held by Lydia York and the Insurance Commissioner currently held by Trinidad Navarro.\nCounties.\nDelaware is subdivided into three counties; from north to south they are New Castle, Kent and Sussex. This is the fewest among all states. Each county elects its own legislative body (known in New Castle and Sussex counties as County Council, and in Kent County as Levy Court), which deal primarily in zoning and development issues. Most functions which are handled on a county-by-county basis in other states\u2014such as court and law enforcement\u2014have been centralized in Delaware, leading to a significant concentration of power in the Delaware state government. The counties were historically divided into hundreds, which were used as tax reporting and voting districts until the 1960s, but now serve no administrative role, their only current official legal use being in real estate title descriptions.\nPolitics.\nThe Democratic Party holds a plurality of registrations in Delaware. Currently, Democrats hold all positions of authority in Delaware, as well as majorities in the state Senate and House. The Democrats have held the governorship since 1993, having won the last seven gubernatorial elections. Democrats presently hold all the nine statewide elected offices, while the Republicans last won any statewide offices in 2014, State Auditor and State Treasurer.\nDuring the First and Second Party Systems, Delaware was a stronghold for the Federalist and Whig Parties, respectively. After a relatively brief adherence to the Democratic Solid South following the US Civil War, Delaware became a Republican-leaning state from 1896 through 1948, voting for losing Republicans Charles Evans Hughes in 1916, Herbert Hoover in 1932, and Thomas Dewey in 1948.\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, Delaware was a bellwether state, voting for the winner of every presidential election from 1952 through 1996. Delaware's bellwether status came to an end when Delaware voted for Al Gore in 2000 by 13%. Subsequent elections have continued to demonstrate Delaware's current strong Democratic lean: John Kerry carried the First State by 8% in 2004; Barack Obama carried it by 25% and by 19% in his two elections of 2008 and 2012; and Hillary Clinton carried it by 11% as she lost the Electoral College in 2016. In 2020, Delaware native (and Barack Obama's former vice president and running mate) Joe Biden headed the Democratic ticket; he carried his home state by just shy of 19% en route to a national 4.5% win.\nThe dominant factor in Delaware's political shift has been the strong Democratic trend in heavily urbanized New Castle County, home to 55% of Delaware's population. New Castle County has not voted Republican in a presidential election since 1988, and has given Democrats over 60% of its vote in every election from 2004 on. In 1992, 2000, 2004, and 2016, the Republican presidential candidate carried both Kent and Sussex but lost by double digits each time in New Castle County, which was a large enough margin to tip the state to the Democrats. New Castle County also elects a substantial majority of the state legislature; 27 of the 41 state house districts and 14 of the 21 state senate districts are based in New Castle County.\nIn a 2020 study, Delaware was ranked as the 18th hardest state for citizens to vote in.\nFreedom of information.\nEach of the 50 states of the United States has passed some form of freedom of information legislation, which provides a mechanism for the general public to request information of the government. In 2011 Delaware passed legislation placing a 15 business day time limit on addressing freedom-of-information requests, to either produce information or an explanation of why such information would take longer than this time to produce. A bill aimed at restricting Freedom of Information Act requests, Senate Bill 155, was discussed in committee.\nTaxation.\nTax is collected by the Delaware Division of Revenue.\nDelaware has six different income tax brackets, ranging from 2.2% to 5.95%. The state does not assess sales tax on consumers. The state does, however, impose a tax on the gross receipts of most businesses. Business and occupational license tax rates range from 0.096% to 1.92%, depending on the category of business activity.\nDelaware does not assess a state-level tax on real or personal property. Real estate is subject to county property taxes, school district property taxes, vocational school district taxes, and, if located within an incorporated area, municipal property taxes.\nGambling provides significant revenue to the state. For instance, the casino at Delaware Park Racetrack provided more than $100million to the state in 2010.\nIn June 2018, Delaware became the first U.S. state to legalize sports betting following the Supreme Court ruling to overturn the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA).\nCulture and entertainment.\nSports.\nAs Delaware has no franchises in the major American professional sports leagues, many Delawareans follow either Philadelphia or Baltimore teams. In the WNBA, the Washington Mystics enjoy a major following due to the presence of Wilmington native and University of Delaware product Elena Delle Donne. The University of Delaware's football team has a large following throughout the state, with the Delaware State University and Wesley College teams also enjoying a smaller degree of support.\nDelaware is home to Dover Motor Speedway and Bally's Dover. Dover Motor Speedway, also known as the \"Monster Mile\", is one of only 10 tracks in the nation to have hosted 100 or more NASCAR Cup Series races. Bally's Dover is a popular harness racing facility. It is the only co-located horse- and car-racing facility in the nation, with the Bally's Dover track located inside the Dover Motor Speedway track.\nDelaware is represented in rugby by the Delaware Black Foxes, a 2015 expansion club.\nDelaware has been home to professional wrestling outfit Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW). CZW has been affiliated with the annual Tournament of Death and ECWA with its annual Super8 Tournament.\nDelaware's official state sport is bicycling.\nForeign Affairs.\nSister State.\nDelaware has had a foreign sister state in Japan, named Miyagi Prefecture. These two have shared relations since 1997, and have had exchange programs available for students that were briefly paused in wake of the earthquake and the tsunami that ensued in the prefecture during March 2011.\nDelawareans.\nProminent Delawareans include the du Pont family of politicians and businesspersons, and the 46th president of the United States Joe Biden. Biden\u2019s family moved to Delaware during his childhood, and he later represented Delaware for 36 years in the United States Senate from 1973 to 2009, before being 47th vice president of the United States from 2009 to 2017."}
{"id": "7931", "revid": "45620980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7931", "title": "Dictionary", "text": "A dictionary is a listing of lexemes from the lexicon of one or more specific languages, often arranged alphabetically (or by consonantal root for Semitic languages or radical and stroke for logographic languages), which may include information on definitions, usage, etymologies, pronunciations, translation, etc. It is a lexicographical reference that shows inter-relationships among the data.\nA broad distinction is made between general and specialized dictionaries. Specialized dictionaries include words in specialist fields, rather than a comprehensive range of words in the language. Lexical items that describe concepts in specific fields are usually called terms instead of words, although there is no consensus whether lexicology and terminology are two different fields of study. In theory, general dictionaries are supposed to be semasiological, mapping word to definition, while specialized dictionaries are supposed to be onomasiological, first identifying concepts and then establishing the terms used to designate them. In practice, the two approaches are used for both types. There are other types of dictionaries that do not fit neatly into the above distinction, for instance bilingual (translation) dictionaries, dictionaries of synonyms (thesauri), and rhyming dictionaries. The word dictionary (unqualified) is usually understood to refer to a general purpose monolingual dictionary.\nThere is also a contrast between \"prescriptive\" or \"descriptive\" dictionaries; the former reflect what is seen as correct use of the language while the latter reflect recorded actual use. Stylistic indications (e.g. \"informal\" or \"vulgar\") in many modern dictionaries are also considered by some to be less than objectively descriptive.\nThe first recorded dictionaries date back to Sumerian times around 2300 BCE, in the form of bilingual dictionaries, and the oldest surviving monolingual dictionaries are Chinese dictionaries . The first purely English alphabetical dictionary was \"A Table Alphabeticall\", written in 1604, and monolingual dictionaries in other languages also began appearing in Europe at around this time. The systematic study of dictionaries as objects of scientific interest arose as a 20th-century enterprise, called lexicography, and largely initiated by Ladislav Zgusta. The birth of the new discipline was not without controversy, with the practical dictionary-makers being sometimes accused by others of having an \"astonishing lack of method and critical self-reflection\".\nHistory.\nThe oldest known dictionaries were cuneiform tablets with bilingual Sumerian\u2013Akkadian wordlists, discovered in Ebla (modern Syria) and dated to roughly 2300 BCE, the time of the Akkadian Empire. The early 2nd millennium BCE \"Urra=hubullu\" glossary is the canonical Babylonian version of such bilingual Sumerian wordlists. A Chinese dictionary, the \"Erya\", is the earliest surviving monolingual dictionary; and some sources cite the \"Shizhoupian\" (probably compiled sometime between 700 BCE to 200 BCE, possibly earlier) as a \"dictionary\", although modern scholarship considers it a calligraphic compendium of Chinese characters from Zhou dynasty bronzes. Philitas of Cos (fl. 4th century BCE) wrote a pioneering vocabulary \"Disorderly Words\" (\u1f0c\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b3\u03bb\u1ff6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9, \"\") which explained the meanings of rare Homeric and other literary words, words from local dialects, and technical terms. Apollonius the Sophist (fl. 1st century CE) wrote the oldest surviving Homeric lexicon. The first Sanskrit dictionary, the Amarako\u015ba, was written by Amarasimha . Written in verse, it listed around 10,000 words. According to the , the first Japanese dictionary was the long-lost 682 CE \"Niina\" glossary of Chinese characters. Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi's 8th century \"Kitab al-'Ayn\" is considered the first dictionary of Arabic. The oldest existing Japanese dictionary, the \"Tenrei Bansh\u014d Meigi\", was also a glossary of written Chinese. In \"Frahang-i Pahlavig\", Aramaic heterograms are listed together with their translation in the Middle Persian language and phonetic transcription in the Pazend alphabet. A 9th-century CE Irish dictionary, Sanas Cormaic, contained etymologies and explanations of over 1,400 Irish words. In the 12th century, The Karakhanid-Turkic scholar Mahmud Kashgari finished his work \"Divan-u L\u00fcgat'it T\u00fcrk\", a dictionary about the Turkic dialects, but especially Karakhanid Turkic. His work contains about 7500 to 8000 words and it was written to teach non Turkic Muslims, especially the Abbasid Arabs, the Turkic language. Al-Zamakhshari wrote a small Arabic dictionary called \"Mu\u1e33addimet\u00fc'l-edeb\" for the Turkic-Khwarazm ruler Atsiz. In the 14th century, the Codex Cumanicus was finished and it served as a dictionary about the Cuman-Turkic language. While in Mamluk Egypt, Eb\u00fb Hayy\u00e2n el-Endel\u00fcs\u00ee finished his work \"Kit\u00e2b\u00fc'l-\u0130dr\u00e2k li-lis\u00e2ni'l-Etr\u00e2k\", a dictionary about the Kipchak and Turcoman languages spoken in Egypt and the Levant. A dictionary called \"Bah\u015fayi\u015f L\u00fcgati\", which is written in old Anatolian Turkish, served also as a dictionary between Oghuz Turkish, Arabic and Persian. But it is not clear who wrote the dictionary or in which century exactly it was published. It was written in old Anatolian Turkish from the Seljuk period and not the late medieval Ottoman period. In India around 1320, Amir Khusro compiled the Khaliq-e-bari, which mainly dealt with Hindustani and Persian words.\nArabic dictionaries were compiled between the 8th and 14th centuries, organizing words in rhyme order (by the last syllable), by alphabetical order of the radicals, or according to the alphabetical order of the first letter (the system used in modern European language dictionaries). The modern system was mainly used in specialist dictionaries, such as those of terms from the Qur'an and hadith, while most general use dictionaries, such as the \"Lisan al-`Arab\" (13th century, still the best-known large-scale dictionary of Arabic) and \"al-Qamus al-Muhit\" (14th century) listed words in the alphabetical order of the radicals. The \"Qamus al-Muhit\" is the first handy dictionary in Arabic, which includes only words and their definitions, eliminating the supporting examples used in such dictionaries as the \"Lisan\" and the \"Oxford English Dictionary\".\nIn medieval Europe, glossaries with equivalents for Latin words in vernacular or simpler Latin were in use (e.g. the Leiden Glossary). The \"Catholicon\" (1287) by Johannes Balbus, a large grammatical work with an alphabetical lexicon, was widely adopted. It served as the basis for several bilingual dictionaries and was one of the earliest books (in 1460) to be printed. In 1502 Ambrogio Calepino's \"Dictionarium\" was published, originally a monolingual Latin dictionary, which over the course of the 16th century was enlarged to become a multilingual glossary. In 1532 Robert Estienne published the \"Thesaurus linguae latinae\" and in 1572 his son Henri Estienne published the \"Thesaurus linguae graecae\", which served up to the 19th century as the basis of Greek lexicography. The first monolingual Spanish dictionary written was Sebasti\u00e1n Covarrubias's \"Tesoro de la lengua castellana o espa\u00f1ola\", published in 1611 in Madrid, Spain. In 1612 the first edition of the \"Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca\", for Italian, was published. It served as the model for similar works in French and English. In 1690 in Rotterdam was published, posthumously, the \"Dictionnaire Universel\" by Antoine Fureti\u00e8re for French. In 1694 appeared the first edition of the (still published, with the ninth edition not complete ). Between 1712 and 1721 was published the \"Vocabulario portughez e latino\" written by Raphael Bluteau. The Royal Spanish Academy published the first edition of the (still published, with a new edition about every decade) in 1780; their \"Diccionario de Autoridades\", which included quotes taken from literary works, was published in 1726. The \"Totius Latinitatis lexicon\" by Egidio Forcellini was firstly published in 1777; it has formed the basis of all similar works that have since been published.\nThe first edition of \"A Greek-English Lexicon\" by Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott appeared in 1843; this work remained the basic dictionary of Greek until the end of the 20th century. And in 1858 was published the first volume of the Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch by the Brothers Grimm; the work was completed in 1961. Between 1861 and 1874 was published the \"Dizionario della lingua italiana\" by Niccol\u00f2 Tommaseo. Between 1862 and 1874 was published the six volumes of \"A magyar nyelv sz\u00f3t\u00e1ra\" (Dictionary of Hungarian Language) by Gergely Czuczor and J\u00e1nos Fogarasi. \u00c9mile Littr\u00e9 published the between 1863 and 1872. In the same year 1863 appeared the first volume of the \"Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal\" which was completed in 1998. Also in 1863 Vladimir Ivanovich Dahl published the \"Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language\". The Duden dictionary dates back to 1880, and is currently the prescriptive source for the spelling of German. The decision to start work on the \"Svenska Akademiens ordbok\" was taken in 1787.\nEnglish dictionaries in Britain.\nThe earliest dictionaries in the English language were glossaries of French, Spanish or Latin words along with their definitions in English. The word \"dictionary\" was invented by an Englishman called John of Garland in 1220 he had written a book \"Dictionarius\" to help with Latin \"diction\". An early non-alphabetical list of 8000 English words was the \"Elementarie\", created by Richard Mulcaster in 1582.\nThe first purely English alphabetical dictionary was \"A Table Alphabeticall\", written by English schoolteacher Robert Cawdrey in 1604. The only surviving copy is found at the Bodleian Library in Oxford. This dictionary, and the many imitators which followed it, was seen as unreliable and nowhere near definitive. Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield was still lamenting in 1754, 150 years after Cawdrey's publication, that it is \"a sort of disgrace to our nation, that hitherto we have had no\u2026 standard of our language; our dictionaries at present being more properly what our neighbors the Dutch and the Germans call theirs, word-books, than dictionaries in the superior sense of that title.\"\nIn 1616, John Bullokar described the history of the dictionary with his \"English Expositor\". \"Glossographia\" by Thomas Blount, published in 1656, contains more than 10,000 words along with their etymologies or histories. Edward Phillips wrote another dictionary in 1658, entitled \"The New World of English Words: Or a General Dictionary\" which boldly plagiarized Blount's work, and the two criticised each other. This created more interest in the dictionaries. John Wilkins' 1668 essay on philosophical language contains a list of 11,500 words with careful distinctions, compiled by William Lloyd. Elisha Coles published his \"English Dictionary\" in 1676.\nIt was not until Samuel Johnson's \"A Dictionary of the English Language\" (1755) that a more reliable English dictionary was produced. Many people today mistakenly believe that Johnson wrote the first English dictionary: a testimony to this legacy. By this stage, dictionaries had evolved to contain textual references for most words, and were arranged alphabetically, rather than by topic (a previously popular form of arrangement, which meant all animals would be grouped together, etc.). Johnson's masterwork could be judged as the first to bring all these elements together, creating the first \"modern\" dictionary.\nJohnson's dictionary remained the English-language standard for over 150 years, until the Oxford University Press began writing and releasing the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in short fascicles from 1884 onwards. A complete ten-volume first edition was not released until 1928. One of the main contributors to this modern dictionary was an ex-army surgeon, William Chester Minor, a convicted murderer who was confined to an asylum for the criminally insane.\nThe OED remains the most comprehensive and trusted English language dictionary to this day, with revisions and updates added by a dedicated team every three months.\nAmerican English dictionaries.\nIn 1806, American Noah Webster published his first dictionary, \"\". In 1807 Webster began compiling an expanded and fully comprehensive dictionary, \"An American Dictionary of the English Language;\" it took twenty-seven years to complete. To evaluate the etymology of words, Webster learned twenty-six languages, including Old English (Anglo-Saxon), German, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Arabic, and Sanskrit.\nWebster completed his dictionary during his year abroad in 1825 in Paris, France, and at the University of Cambridge. His book contained seventy thousand words, of which twelve thousand had never appeared in a published dictionary before. As a spelling reformer, Webster believed that English spelling rules were unnecessarily complex, so his dictionary introduced spellings that became American English, replacing \"colour\" with \"color\", substituting \"wagon\" for \"waggon\", and printing \"center\" instead of \"centre\". He also added American words, like \"skunk\" and \"squash\", which did not appear in British dictionaries. At the age of seventy, Webster published his dictionary in 1828; it sold 2500 copies. In 1840, the second edition was published in two volumes. Webster's dictionary was acquired by G &amp; C Merriam Co. in 1843, after his death, and has since been published in many revised editions. Merriam-Webster was acquired by Encyclopedia Britannica in 1964.\nControversy over the lack of usage advice in the 1961 \"Webster's Third New International Dictionary\" spurred publication of the 1969 \"The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\", the first dictionary to use corpus linguistics.\nTypes.\nIn a general dictionary, each word may have multiple meanings. Some dictionaries include each separate meaning in the order of most common usage while others list definitions in historical order, with the oldest usage first.\nIn many languages, words can appear in many different forms, but only the undeclined or unconjugated form appears as the headword in most dictionaries. Dictionaries are most commonly found in the form of a book, but some newer dictionaries, like StarDict and the \"New Oxford American Dictionary\" are dictionary software running on PDAs or computers. There are also many online dictionaries accessible via the Internet.\nSpecialized dictionaries.\nAccording to the \"Manual of Specialized Lexicographies\", a specialized dictionary, also referred to as a technical dictionary, is a dictionary that focuses upon a specific subject field, as opposed to a dictionary that comprehensively contains words from the lexicon of a specific language or languages. Following the description in \"The Bilingual LSP Dictionary\", lexicographers categorize specialized dictionaries into three types: A multi-field dictionary broadly covers several subject fields (e.g. a business dictionary), a single-field dictionary narrowly covers one particular subject field (e.g. law), and a sub-field dictionary covers a more specialized field (e.g. constitutional law). For example, the 23-language Inter-Active Terminology for Europe is a multi-field dictionary, the American National Biography is a single-field, and the African American National Biography Project is a sub-field dictionary. In terms of the coverage distinction between \"minimizing dictionaries\" and \"maximizing dictionaries\", multi-field dictionaries tend to minimize coverage across subject fields (for instance, \"Oxford Dictionary of World Religions\" and \"Yadgar Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms\") whereas single-field and sub-field dictionaries tend to maximize coverage within a limited subject field (\"The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology\").\nAnother variant is the glossary, an alphabetical list of defined terms in a specialized field, such as medicine (medical dictionary).\nDefining dictionaries.\nThe simplest dictionary, a defining dictionary, provides a core glossary of the simplest meanings of the simplest concepts. From these, other concepts can be explained and defined, in particular for those who are first learning a language. In English, the commercial defining dictionaries typically include only one or two meanings of under 2000 words. With these, the rest of English, and even the 4000 most common English idioms and metaphors, can be defined.\nPrescriptive vs. descriptive.\nLexicographers apply two basic philosophies to the defining of words: \"prescriptive\" or \"descriptive\". Noah Webster, intent on forging a distinct identity for the American language, altered spellings and accentuated differences in meaning and pronunciation of some words. This is why American English now uses the spelling \"color\" while the rest of the English-speaking world prefers \"colour\". (Similarly, British English subsequently underwent a few spelling changes that did not affect American English; see further at American and British English spelling differences.)\nLarge 20th-century dictionaries such as the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (OED) and \"Webster's Third\" are descriptive, and attempt to describe the actual use of words. Most dictionaries of English now apply the descriptive method to a word's definition, and then, outside of the definition itself, provide information alerting readers to attitudes which may influence their choices on words often considered vulgar, offensive, erroneous, or easily confused. \"Merriam-Webster\" is subtle, only adding italicized notations such as, \"sometimes offensive\" or \"stand\" (nonstandard). \"American Heritage\" goes further, discussing issues separately in numerous \"usage notes.\" \"Encarta\" provides similar notes, but is more prescriptive, offering warnings and admonitions against the use of certain words considered by many to be offensive or illiterate, such as, \"an offensive term for...\" or \"a taboo term meaning...\".\nBecause of the widespread use of dictionaries in schools, and their acceptance by many as language authorities, their treatment of the language does affect usage to some degree, with even the most descriptive dictionaries providing conservative continuity. In the long run, however, the meanings of words in English are primarily determined by usage, and the language is being changed and created every day. As Jorge Luis Borges says in the prologue to \"El otro, el mismo\": \"It is often forgotten that (dictionaries) are artificial repositories, put together well after the languages they define. The roots of language are irrational and of a magical nature.\"\nSometimes the same dictionary can be descriptive in some domains and prescriptive in others. For example, according to Ghil'ad Zuckermann, the \"Oxford English-Hebrew Dictionary\" is \"at war with itself\": whereas its coverage (lexical items) and glosses (definitions) are descriptive and colloquial, its vocalization is prescriptive. This internal conflict results in absurd sentences such as \"hi tahar\u00f3g ot\u00ed kshetir\u00e9 me as\u00edti lamkhon\u00edt\" (she'll tear me apart when she sees what I've done to the car). Whereas \"hi tahar\u00f3g ot\u00ed\", literally 'she will kill me', is colloquial, \"me\" (a variant of \"ma\" 'what') is archaic, resulting in a combination that is unutterable in real life.\nHistorical dictionaries.\nA historical dictionary is a specific kind of descriptive dictionary which describes the development of words and senses over time, usually using citations to original source material to support its conclusions.\nDictionaries for natural language processing.\nIn contrast to traditional dictionaries, which are designed to be used by human beings, dictionaries for natural language processing (NLP) are built to be used by computer programs. The final user is a human being but the direct user is a program. Such a dictionary does not need to be able to be printed on paper. The structure of the content is not linear, ordered entry by entry but has the form of a complex network (see Diathesis alternation). Because most of these dictionaries are used to control machine translations or cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) the content is usually multilingual and usually of huge size. In order to allow formalized exchange and merging of dictionaries, an ISO standard called Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) has been defined and used among the industrial and academic community.\nPronunciation.\nIn many languages, such as the English language, the pronunciation of some words is not consistently apparent from their spelling. In these languages, dictionaries usually provide the pronunciation. For example, the definition for the word \"dictionary\" might be followed by the International Phonetic Alphabet spelling (in British English) or (in American English). American English dictionaries often use their own pronunciation respelling systems with diacritics, for example \"dictionary\" is respelled as \"d\u012dk\u2032sh\u0259-n\u0115r\u2032\u0113\" in the American Heritage Dictionary. The IPA is more commonly used within the British Commonwealth countries. Yet others use their own pronunciation respelling systems without diacritics: for example, \"dictionary\" may be respelled as . Some online or electronic dictionaries provide audio recordings of words being spoken.\nExamples.\nDictionaries of other languages.\nHistories and descriptions of the dictionaries of other languages on Wikipedia include:\nOnline dictionaries.\nThe age of the Internet brought online dictionaries to the desktop and, more recently, to the smart phone. David Skinner in 2013 noted that \"Among the top ten lookups on Merriam-Webster Online at this moment are \"holistic, pragmatic, caveat, esoteric\" and \"bourgeois.\" Teaching users about words they don't already know has been, historically, an aim of lexicography, and modern dictionaries do this well.\"\nThere exist a number of websites which operate as online dictionaries, usually with a specialized focus. Some of them have exclusively user driven content, often consisting of neologisms. Some of the more notable examples are given in List of online dictionaries and ."}

Friedman", "text": "David Director Friedman (born February 12, 1945) is an American economist, physicist, legal scholar, and anarcho-capitalist theorist. Although his academic training was in chemistry and physics and not law or economics, he is known for his textbook writings on microeconomics and the libertarian theory of anarcho-capitalism, which is the subject of his most popular book, \"The Machinery of Freedom\". Described by Walter Block as a \"free-market anarchist\" theorist, Friedman has also authored several other books and articles, including \"Price Theory: An Intermediate Text\" (1986), \"Law's Order: What Economics Has to Do with Law and Why It Matters\" (2000), \"Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday Life\" (1996), and \"Future Imperfect\" (2008).\nLife and work.\nDavid Friedman is the son of economists Rose and Milton Friedman. He graduated \"magna cum laude\" from Harvard University in 1965, with a bachelor's degree in chemistry and physics. He later earned a master's (1967) and a PhD (1971) in theoretical physics from the University of Chicago. Despite his later career, he never took a class for credit in either economics or law. He was a professor of law at Santa Clara University from 2005 to 2017, and a contributing editor for \"Liberty\" magazine. He is currently a Professor Emeritus. He is an atheist. His son, Patri Friedman, has also written about libertarian theory and market anarchism, particularly seasteading.\n\"The Machinery of Freedom\".\nIn his book \"The Machinery of Freedom\" (1973), Friedman sketched a form of anarcho-capitalism where all goods and services including law itself can be produced by the free market. Friedman advocates an incrementalist approach to achieve anarcho-capitalism by gradual privatization of areas that government is involved in, ultimately privatizing the law itself. In the book, he states his opposition to violent anarcho-capitalist revolution.\nHe advocates a consequentialist version of anarcho-capitalism, arguing for it on a cost\u2013benefit analysis of state versus no state. It is contrasted with the natural-rights approach as propounded most notably by economist and libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard.\nNon-academic interests.\nFriedman is a longtime member of the Society for Creative Anachronism, where he is known as \"Duke Cariadoc of the Bow\". He is known throughout the worldwide society for his articles on the philosophy of recreationism and practical historical recreations, especially those relating to the medieval Middle East. His work is compiled in the popular \"Cariadoc's Miscellany\". He is sometimes credited with founding the largest and longest-running SCA event, the Pennsic War; as king of the Middle Kingdom he challenged the East Kingdom, and later as king of the East accepted the challenge and lost (to himself).\nHe was a teenage wargamer who taught his school friend, Jack Radey, founder of People's War Games, how to play such wargames as \"Tactics II\". Radey relates how Friedman and himself wrote to Charles S. Roberts claiming that they had found a first turn winning strategy for each of the two sides. Roberts replied that their interpretation of the rules was valid.\nHe is a long-time science fiction fan, and has written three novels. \"Harald\" (Baen Books, 2006) is set in an invented world drawn from European history.\n\"Salamander\" (2011) and its sequel \"Brothers\" (2020) are fantasy.\nHe has spoken in favor of a non-interventionist foreign policy."}

{"id": "7938", "revid": "12331483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7938", "title": "Diatomic molecule", "text": "Diatomic molecules () are molecules composed of only two atoms, of the same or different chemical elements. If a diatomic molecule consists of two atoms of the same element, such as hydrogen () or oxygen (), then it is said to be homonuclear. Otherwise, if a diatomic molecule consists of two different atoms, such as carbon monoxide () or nitric oxide (), the molecule is said to be heteronuclear. The bond in a homonuclear diatomic molecule is non-polar.\nThe only chemical elements that form stable homonuclear diatomic molecules at standard temperature and pressure (STP) (or at typical laboratory conditions of 1 bar and 25\u00a0\u00b0C) are the gases hydrogen (), nitrogen (), oxygen (), fluorine (), and chlorine (), and the liquid bromine ().\nThe noble gases (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon) are also gases at STP, but they are monatomic. The homonuclear diatomic gases and noble gases together are called \"elemental gases\" or \"molecular gases\", to distinguish them from other gases that are chemical compounds.\nAt slightly elevated temperatures, the halogens bromine () and iodine () also form diatomic gases. All halogens have been observed as diatomic molecules, except for astatine and tennessine, which are uncertain.\nOther elements form diatomic molecules when evaporated, but these diatomic species repolymerize when cooled. Heating (\"cracking\") elemental phosphorus gives diphosphorus (). Sulfur vapor is mostly disulfur (). Dilithium () and disodium () are known in the gas phase. Ditungsten () and dimolybdenum () form with sextuple bonds in the gas phase. Dirubidium () is diatomic.\nHeteronuclear molecules.\nAll other diatomic molecules are chemical compounds of two different elements. Many elements can combine to form heteronuclear diatomic molecules, depending on temperature and pressure.\nExamples are gases carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), and hydrogen chloride (HCl).\nMany 1:1 binary compounds are not normally considered diatomic because they are polymeric at room temperature, but they form diatomic molecules when evaporated, for example gaseous MgO, SiO, and many others.\nOccurrence.\nHundreds of diatomic molecules have been identified in the environment of the Earth, in the laboratory, and in interstellar space. About 99% of the Earth's atmosphere is composed of two species of diatomic molecules: nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). The natural abundance of hydrogen (H2) in the Earth's atmosphere is only of the order of parts per million, but H2 is the most abundant diatomic molecule in the universe. The interstellar medium is dominated by hydrogen atoms.\nMolecular geometry.\nAll diatomic molecules are linear and characterized by a single parameter which is the bond length or distance between the two atoms. Diatomic nitrogen has a triple bond, diatomic oxygen has a double bond, and diatomic hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, iodine, and bromine all have single bonds.\nHistorical significance.\nDiatomic elements played an important role in the elucidation of the concepts of element, atom, and molecule in the 19th century, because some of the most common elements, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, occur as diatomic molecules. John Dalton's original atomic hypothesis assumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another. For example, Dalton assumed water's formula to be HO, giving the atomic weight of oxygen as eight times that of hydrogen, instead of the modern value of about 16. As a consequence, confusion existed regarding atomic weights and molecular formulas for about half a century.\nAs early as 1805, Gay-Lussac and von Humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen, and by 1811 Amedeo Avogadro had arrived at the correct interpretation of water's composition, based on what is now called Avogadro's law and the assumption of diatomic elemental molecules. However, these results were mostly ignored until 1860, partly due to the belief that atoms of one element would have no chemical affinity toward atoms of the same element, and also partly due to apparent exceptions to Avogadro's law that were not explained until later in terms of dissociating molecules.\nAt the 1860 Karlsruhe Congress on atomic weights, Cannizzaro resurrected Avogadro's ideas and used them to produce a consistent table of atomic weights, which mostly agree with modern values. These weights were an important prerequisite for the discovery of the periodic law by Dmitri Mendeleev and Lothar Meyer.\nExcited electronic states.\nDiatomic molecules are normally in their lowest or ground state, which conventionally is also known as the formula_1 state. When a gas of diatomic molecules is bombarded by energetic electrons, some of the molecules may be excited to higher electronic states, as occurs, for example, in the natural aurora; high-altitude nuclear explosions; and rocket-borne electron gun experiments. Such excitation can also occur when the gas absorbs light or other electromagnetic radiation. The excited states are unstable and naturally relax back to the ground state. Over various short time scales after the excitation (typically a fraction of a second, or sometimes longer than a second if the excited state is metastable), transitions occur from higher to lower electronic states and ultimately to the ground state, and in each transition results a photon is emitted. This emission is known as fluorescence. Successively higher electronic states are conventionally named formula_2, formula_3, formula_4, etc. (but this convention is not always followed, and sometimes lower case letters and alphabetically out-of-sequence letters are used, as in the example given below). The excitation energy must be greater than or equal to the energy of the electronic state in order for the excitation to occur.\nIn quantum theory, an electronic state of a diatomic molecule is represented by the molecular term symbol\nwhere formula_6 is the total electronic spin quantum number, formula_7 is the total electronic angular momentum quantum number along the internuclear axis, and formula_8 is the vibrational quantum number. formula_7 takes on values 0, 1, 2, ..., which are represented by the electronic state symbols formula_10, formula_11, formula_12, ...\nFor example, the following table lists the common electronic states (without vibrational quantum numbers) along with the energy of the lowest vibrational level (formula_13) of diatomic nitrogen (N2), the most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere. \nThe subscripts and superscripts after formula_7 give additional quantum mechanical details about the electronic state. The superscript formula_15 or formula_16 determines whether reflection in a plane containing the internuclear axis introduces a sign change in the wavefunction. The sub-script formula_17 or formula_18 applies to molecules of identical atoms, and when reflecting the state along a plane perpendicular to the molecular axis, states that does not change are labelled formula_17 (gerade), and states that change sign are labelled formula_18 (ungerade).\nThe aforementioned fluorescence occurs in distinct regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, called \"emission bands\": each band corresponds to a particular transition from a higher electronic state and vibrational level to a lower electronic state and vibrational level (typically, many vibrational levels are involved in an excited gas of diatomic molecules). For example, N2 formula_2-formula_1 emission bands (a.k.a. Vegard-Kaplan bands) are present in the spectral range from 0.14 to 1.45 \u03bcm (micrometres). A given band can be spread out over several nanometers in electromagnetic wavelength space, owing to the various transitions that occur in the molecule's rotational quantum number, formula_23. These are classified into distinct sub-band branches, depending on the change in formula_23. The formula_25 branch corresponds to formula_26, the formula_27 branch to formula_28, and the formula_29 branch to formula_30. Bands are spread out even further by the limited spectral resolution of the spectrometer that is used to measure the spectrum. The spectral resolution depends on the instrument's point spread function.\nEnergy levels.\nThe molecular term symbol is a shorthand expression of the angular momenta that characterize the electronic quantum states of a diatomic molecule, which are also eigenstates of the electronic molecular Hamiltonian. It is also convenient, and common, to represent a diatomic molecule as two-point masses connected by a massless spring. The energies involved in the various motions of the molecule can then be broken down into three categories: the translational, rotational, and vibrational energies. The theoretical study of the rotational energy levels of the diatomic molecules can be described using the below description of the rotational energy levels. While the study of vibrational energy level of the diatomic molecules can be described using the harmonic oscillator approximation or using the quantum vibrational interaction potentials. These potentials give more accurate energy levels because they take multiple vibrational effects into account.\nConcerning history, the first treatment of diatomic molecules with quantum mechanics was made by Lucy Mensing in 1926.\nTranslational energies.\nThe translational energy of the molecule is given by the kinetic energy expression:\nwhere formula_32 is the mass of the molecule and formula_8 is its velocity.\nRotational energies.\nClassically, the kinetic energy of rotation is\nwhere\nFor microscopic, atomic-level systems like a molecule, angular momentum can only have specific discrete values given by\nwhere formula_38 is a non-negative integer and formula_39 is the reduced Planck constant.\nAlso, for a diatomic molecule the moment of inertia is\nwhere\nSo, substituting the angular momentum and moment of inertia into Erot, the rotational energy levels of a diatomic molecule are given by:\nVibrational energies.\nAnother type of motion of a diatomic molecule is for each atom to oscillate\u2014or vibrate\u2014along the line connecting the two atoms. The vibrational energy is approximately that of a quantum harmonic oscillator:\nwhere\nComparison between rotational and vibrational energy spacings.\nThe spacing, and the energy of a typical spectroscopic transition, between vibrational energy levels is about 100 times greater than that of a typical transition between rotational energy levels.\nHund's cases.\nThe good quantum numbers for a diatomic molecule, as well as good approximations of rotational energy levels, can be obtained by modeling the molecule using Hund's cases.\nMnemonics.\nThe mnemonics \"BrINClHOF\", pronounced \"Brinklehof\", \"HONClBrIF\", pronounced \"Honkelbrif\", \u201cHOBrFINCl\u201d, pronounced \u201cHoberfinkel\u201d, and \"HOFBrINCl\", pronounced \"Hofbrinkle\", have been coined to aid recall of the list of diatomic elements. Another method, for English-speakers, is the sentence: \"Never Have Fear of Ice Cold Beer\" as a representation of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, Fluorine, Oxygen, Iodine, Chlorine, Bromine."}
{"id": "7939", "revid": "16868722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7939", "title": "Duopoly", "text": "A duopoly (from Greek , ; and , ) is a type of oligopoly where two firms have dominant or exclusive control over a market, and most (if not all) of the competition within that market occurs directly between them.\nDuopoly is the most commonly studied form of oligopoly due to its simplicity. Duopolies sell to consumers in a competitive market where the choice of an individual consumer choice cannot affect the firm in a duopoly market, as the defining characteristic of duopolies is that decisions made by each seller are dependent on what the other competitor does. Duopolies can exist in various forms, such as Cournot, Bertrand, or Stackelberg competition. These models demonstrate how firms in a duopoly can compete on output or price, depending on the assumptions made about firm behavior and market conditions.\nSimilar features are discernible in national political systems of party duopoly.\nDuopoly models in economics and game theory.\nCournot duopoly.\nCournot model in game theory.\nIn 1838, Antoine Augustin Cournot published a book titled \"Researches Into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth\" in which he introduced and developed this model for the first time. As an imperfect competition model, Cournot duopoly (also known as Cournot competition), in which two firms with identical cost functions compete with homogenous products in a static context, is also known as Cournot competition. The Cournot model, shows that two firms assume each other's output and treat this as a fixed amount, and produce in their own firm according to this. The Cournot duopoly model relies on the following assumptions:\nIn this model, two companies, each of which chooses its own quantity of output, compete against each other while facing constant marginal and average costs. The market price is determined by the sum of the output of two companies. formula_1 is the equation for the market demand function.\nformula_2\nThe general process for obtaining a Nash equilibrium of a game using the best response functions is followed in order to discover a Nash equilibrium of Cournot's model for a specific cost function and demand function. A Nash Equilibrium of the Cournot model is a such that\nFor a given formula_3 solves:\nformula_4\nGiven the other firm's optimal quantity, each firm maximizes its profit over the residual inverse demand. In equilibrium, no firm can increase profits by changing its output level Two first order conditions equal to zero are the best response.\nCournot's duopoly marked the beginning of the study of oligopolies, and specifically duopolies, as well as the expansion of the research of market structures, which had previously focussed on the extremes of perfect competition and monopoly. In the Cournot duopoly model, firms choose the quantity of output they produce simultaneously, taking into consideration the quantity produced by their competitor. Each firm's profit depends on the total output produced by both firms, and the market price is determined by the sum of their outputs. The goal of each firm is to maximize its profit given the output produced by the other firm. This process continues until both firms reach a Nash equilibrium, where neither firm has an incentive to change its output level given the output of the other firm.\nBertrand duopoly.\nBertrand model in game theory.\nThe Bertrand competition was developed by a French mathematician called Joseph Louis Fran\u00e7ois Bertrand after investigating the claims of the Cournot model in \"Researches into the mathematical principles of the theory of wealth, 1838\". According to the Cournot model, firms in a duopoly would be able to keep prices above marginal cost and hence be extremely profitable. Bertrand took issue with this. In this market structure, each firm could only choose whole amounts and each firm receives zero payoffs when the aggregate demand exceeds the size of the amount that they share with each other. The market demand function is formula_5. The Bertrand model has similar assumptions to the Cournot model:\nThe Bertrand model, in which, in a game of two firms, competes in price instead of output. Each one of them will assume that the other will not change prices in response to its price cuts. When both firms use this logic, they will reach a Nash equilibrium.\nLet be the monopoly price, formula_7\nformula_8\nFor rival prices above cost, each firm has incentive to undercut rival to get the whole demand. If rival prices below cost, firms make losses when it attracts demand; firm better off charging at cost level. Nash equilibrium is .\nBertrand paradox.\nUnder static price competition with homogenous products and constant, symmetric marginal cost, firms price at the level of marginal cost and make no economic profits. In contrast to the Cournot model, the Bertrand duopoly model assumes that firms compete on price rather than quantity. Each firm sets its price simultaneously, anticipating that the other firm will not change its price in response. When both firms use this logic, they will reach a Nash equilibrium, where neither firm has an incentive to change its price given the price set by the other firm. In this model, firms tend to price their products at the level of their marginal cost, resulting in zero economic profits, a phenomenon known as the Bertrand paradox.\nQuality standards.\nIn a duopoly, quality standards can play a significant role in the competitive dynamics between the two firms. A low-quality manufacturer may benefit from a slightly stringent quality standard in the absence of sunk costs, whereas a high-quality producer may suffer from it. Consumer welfare improves if the firm generating the higher quality does not considerably enhance its quality in response to its competitor's increase in quality. Exit from the industry is triggered by a sufficiently strict requirement. The high-quality producer exits first when there are no sunk costs. In some cases, firms may engage in a quality competition, attempting to outdo one another by improving their products or services to attract more customers.\nPolitics.\nLike a market, a political system can be dominated by two groups, which exclude other parties or ideologies from participation. This is known as a two-party system. In such a system, one party or the other tends to dominate government at any given time (the Majority party), while the other has only limited power (the Minority party). According to Duverger's law, this tends to be caused by a simple winner-take-all voting system without runoffs or ranked choices. The United States and many Latin American countries, such as Costa Rica, Guyana, and the Dominican Republic have two-party government systems.\nDuopoly in Danish court politics.\nThe prime minister-finance minister duopoly is an unusual form of court politics. There have been few other countries where the prime minister and the Treasury have had such a tumultuous relationship as Australia and the United Kingdom. There have been some confrontations in the past when the Finance ministry did not have the full support of the prime minister, leading to internal ministerial battles over economic strategy. A permanent civil service is a basic requirement for the duopoly system to function properly. The permanent civil service in general, and the Socialist Party in particular, are critical to the duopoly's effective operation. The conventional inter-governmental duopoly is carried by civil servants. The duopoly is confronted with some quandaries, such as tensions between different groups in the office over their relative positions. Departmental budget cuts are being made across the board. The prime ministerial-finance-ministry duopoly requires more credibility. Trust is a rare commodity among Australians and Britons. Denmark has a lot to offer. The Danish duopoly works together. Australia and the United Kingdom have competitive duopolies, and competitive duopolies are unstable.\nTypes of duopoly.\nCournot duopoly.\nA Cournot duopoly is a model of strategic interaction between two firms where they simultaneously choose their output levels, assuming the rival's output level is fixed. The firms compete on quantity, and each firm attempts to maximize its profit given the other firm's output level. This leads to a Nash equilibrium where neither firm has an incentive to change its output, given the other firm's output.\nBertrand duopoly.\nIn a Bertrand duopoly, two firms compete on price instead of quantity. Each firm assumes that its rival's price is fixed and chooses its own price to maximize profit. This model predicts that, under certain conditions, firms will set prices equal to marginal cost, leading to perfect competition.\nStackelberg duopoly.\nA Stackelberg duopoly is a model where one firm (the leader) chooses its output level first, followed by the other firm (the follower). The follower observes the leader's output decision and adjusts its own output to maximize profit. The Stackelberg model often results in a higher total output and lower market price than the Cournot and Bertrand models.\nExamples in business.\nA commonly cited example of a duopoly is that involving Visa and Mastercard, who between them control a large proportion of the electronic payment processing market. In 2000 they were the defendants in a United States Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit. An appeal was upheld in 2004.\nExamples where two companies control an overwhelming proportion of a market are:\nMedia.\nIn Finland, the state-owned broadcasting company Yleisradio and the private broadcaster Mainos-TV had a legal duopoly (in the economists' sense of the word) from the 1950s to 1993. No other broadcasters were allowed. Mainos-TV operated by leasing air time from Yleisradio, broadcasting in reserved blocks between Yleisradio's own programming on its two channels. This was a unique phenomenon in the world. Between 1986 and 1992 there was an independent third channel but it was jointly owned by Yle and M-TV; only in 1993 did M-TV get its own channel.\nIn Kenya, mobile service providers Safaricom and Airtel in Kenya form a duopoly in the Kenyan telecommunications industry.\nIn Singapore, the mass media industry is presently dominated by two players, namely Mediacorp and SPH Media Trust.\nIn the United Kingdom, the BBC and ITV formed an effective duopoly (with Channel 4 originally being economically dependent on ITV) until the development of multichannel from the 1990s onwards.\nBroadcasting.\nDuopoly is used in the United States broadcast television and radio industry to refer to a single company owning two outlets in the same city. This usage is technically incompatible with the normal definition of the word and may lead to confusion, inasmuch as there are generally more than two owners of broadcast television stations in markets with broadcast duopolies. In Canada, this definition is therefore more commonly called a \"twinstick\"."}

The game was first published in 1974 by Tactical Studies Rules (TSR). It has been published by Wizards of the Coast, later a subsidiary of Hasbro, since 1997. The game was derived from miniature wargames, with a variation of the 1971 game \"Chainmail\" serving as the initial rule system. \"D&amp;D\" publication is commonly recognized as the beginning of modern role-playing games and the role-playing game industry, which also deeply influenced video games, especially the role-playing video game genre.\n\"D&amp;D\" departs from traditional wargaming by allowing each player to create their own character to play instead of a military formation. These characters embark upon adventures within a fantasy setting. A Dungeon Master (DM) serves as referee and storyteller for the game, while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur, and playing the role of the inhabitants of the game world, known as non-player characters (NPCs). The characters form a party and they interact with the setting's inhabitants and each other. Together they solve problems, engage in battles, explore, and gather treasure and knowledge. In the process, player characters earn experience points (XP) to level up, and become increasingly powerful over a series of separate gaming sessions. Players choose a class when they create their character, which gives them special perks and abilities every few levels.\nThe early success of \"D&amp;D\" led to a proliferation of similar game systems. Despite the competition, \"D&amp;D\" has remained the market leader in the role-playing game industry. In 1977, the game was split into two branches: the relatively rules-light game system of basic \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", and the more structured, rules-heavy game system of \"Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" (abbreviated as \"AD&amp;D\"). \"AD&amp;D\" 2nd Edition was published in 1989. In 2000, a new system was released as \"D&amp;D\" 3rd edition, continuing the edition numbering from \"AD&amp;D\"; a revised version 3.5 was released in June 2003. These 3rd edition rules formed the basis of the d20 System, which is available under the Open Game License (OGL) for use by other publishers. \"D&amp;D\" 4th edition was released in June 2008. The 5th edition of \"D&amp;D\", the most recent, was released during the second half of 2014.\nIn 2004, \"D&amp;D\" remained the best-known, and best-selling, role-playing game in the US, with an estimated 20 million people having played the game and more than US$1 billion in book and equipment sales worldwide. The year 2017 had \"the most number of players in its history\u201412 million to 15 million in North America alone\". \"D&amp;D 5th edition\" sales \"were up 41 percent in 2017 from the year before, and soared another 52 percent in 2018, the game's biggest sales year yet\". The game has been supplemented by many premade adventures, as well as commercial campaign settings suitable for use by regular gaming groups. \"D&amp;D\" is known beyond the game itself for other \"D&amp;D\"-branded products, references in popular culture, and some of the controversies that have surrounded it, particularly a moral panic in the 1980s that attempted to associate it with Satanism and suicide. The game has won multiple awards and has been translated into many languages.\nPlay overview.\n\"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" is a structured yet open-ended role-playing game. It is normally played indoors with the participants seated around a tabletop. Typically, one player takes on the role of Dungeon Master (DM) while the others each control a single character, representing an individual in a fictional setting. When working together as a group, the player characters (PCs) are often described as a \"party\" of adventurers, with each member often having their own area of specialty that contributes to the success of the group as a whole. During the course of play, each player directs the actions of their character and their interactions with other characters in the game. This activity is performed through the verbal impersonation of the characters by the players, while employing a variety of social and other useful cognitive skills, such as logic, basic mathematics, and imagination. A game often continues over a series of meetings to complete a single adventure, and longer into a series of related gaming adventures, called a \"campaign\".\nThe results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the game are determined by the DM according to the rules of the game and the DM's interpretation of those rules. The DM selects and describes the various non-player characters (NPCs) that the party encounters, the settings in which these interactions occur, and the outcomes of those encounters based on the players' choices and actions. Encounters often take the form of battles with \"monsters\"\u00a0\u2013 a generic term used in \"D&amp;D\" to describe potentially hostile beings such as animals, aberrant beings, or mythical creatures. In addition to jewels and gold coins, magic items form part of the treasure that the players often seek in a dungeon. Magic items are generally found in treasure hoards, or recovered from fallen opponents; sometimes, a powerful or important magic item is the object of a quest. The game's extensive rules\u00a0\u2013 which cover diverse subjects such as social interactions, magic use, combat, and the effect of the environment on PCs\u00a0\u2013 help the DM to make these decisions. The DM may choose to deviate from the published rules or make up new ones if they feel it is necessary.\nThe most recent versions of the game's rules are detailed in three Fifth Edition core rulebooks: The \"Player's Handbook\", the \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" and the \"Monster Manual\".\nThe only items required to play the game are the rulebooks, a character sheet for each player, and a number of polyhedral dice. Many players also use miniature figures on a grid map as a visual aid if desired, particularly during combat. Some editions of the game presume such usage. Many optional accessories are available to enhance the game, such as expansion rulebooks, pre-designed adventures, and various campaign settings.\nGame mechanics.\nBefore the game begins, each player creates their player character and records the details (described below) on a character sheet. First, a player determines their character's ability scores, which consist of Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each edition of the game has offered differing methods of determining these scores. The player then chooses a species (such as a dwarf, elf, or human \u2013 called \"race\" prior to 5e 2024), a character class (such as a fighter, rogue, or wizard), an alignment (a moral and ethical outlook), and other features to round out the character's abilities and backstory, which have varied in nature through differing editions.\nDuring the game, players describe their PCs' intended actions to the DM, who then describes the result or response. Trivial actions, such as picking up a letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful. The outcomes of more complex or risky actions, such as scaling a cliff or picking a lock, are determined by rolling dice. Different polyhedral dice are used for different actions. For example, a twenty-sided die is used to determine whether a hit is made in combat, with other dice such as four, six, eight, ten, or even twelve-sided die used to determine how much damage was dealt. Factors contributing to the outcome include the character's ability scores, skills, and the difficulty of the task. In circumstances where a character is attempting to avoid a negative outcome, such as when dodging a trap or resisting the effect of a spell, a saving throw can be used to determine whether the resulting effect is reduced or avoided. In this case the odds of success are influenced by the character's class, levels and ability scores. In circumstances where a character is attempting to complete a task such as picking a lock, deactivating a trap, or pushing a boulder, a Difficulty Class must be hit or exceeded. Relevant ability bonuses are added to help players succeed.\nAs the game is played, each PC changes over time and generally increases in capability. Characters gain (or sometimes lose) experience, skills and wealth, and may even alter their alignment or gain additional character classes, which is called \"Multiclassing\". The key way characters progress is by earning experience points (XP), which happens when they defeat an enemy or accomplish a difficult task. Acquiring enough XP allows a PC to advance a level, which grants the character improved class features, abilities and skills. XP can be lost in some circumstances, such as encounters with creatures that drain life energy, or by use of certain magical powers that come with an XP cost.\nHit points (HP) are a measure of a character's vitality and health and are determined by the class, level and Constitution of each character. They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game. Death can also result from the loss of key ability scores or character levels. When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result. If resurrection is not possible or not desired, the player may instead create a new PC to resume playing the game.\nAdventures and campaigns.\nA typical \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" game consists of an \"adventure\", which is roughly equivalent to a single story or quest. The DM can either design an original adventure or follow one of the many premade adventures (also known as \"modules\") that have been published throughout the history of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\". Published adventures typically include a background story, illustrations, maps, and goals for players to achieve. Some may include location descriptions and handouts, although they are not required for gameplay. Although a small adventure entitled \"Temple of the Frog\" was included in the \"Blackmoor\" rules supplement in 1975, the first stand-alone \"D&amp;D\" module published by TSR was 1978's \"Steading of the Hill Giant Chief\", written by Gygax.\nA linked series of adventures is commonly referred to as a \"campaign\". The locations where these adventures occur, such as a city, country, planet, or entire fictional universe, are referred to as \"campaign settings\" or \"worlds.\" \"D&amp;D\" settings are based in various fantasy genres and feature different levels and types of magic and technology. Popular commercially published campaign settings for \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" include \"Greyhawk\", \"Dragonlance\", \"Forgotten Realms\", \"Mystara\", \"Spelljammer\", \"Ravenloft\", \"Dark Sun\", \"Planescape\", \"Birthright\", and \"Eberron\".\nIn addition to first-party campaigns and modules, two campaigns based on popular culture have been created. The first, based on \"Stranger Things\", was released in May 2019. A campaign based on the \"Rick and Morty vs. Dungeons and Dragons\" comic book series was later released in November 2019.\nAlternatively, DMs may develop their own fictional worlds to use as campaign settings, either planning the adventure ahead or expanding on it as the players progress.\nMiniature figures.\nThe wargames from which \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" evolved used miniature figures to represent combatants. \"D&amp;D\" initially continued the use of miniatures in a fashion similar to its direct precursors. The original \"D&amp;D\" set of 1974 required the use of the \"Chainmail\" miniatures game for combat resolution. By the publication of the 1977 game editions, combat was mostly resolved verbally. Thus, miniatures were no longer required for gameplay, although some players continued to use them as a visual reference.\nIn the 1970s, numerous companies began to sell miniature figures specifically for \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" and similar games. Licensed miniature manufacturers who produced official figures include Grenadier Miniatures (1980\u20131983), Citadel Miniatures (1984\u20131986), Ral Partha, and TSR itself. Most of these miniatures used the 25\u00a0mm scale.\nPeriodically, \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" has returned to its wargaming roots with supplementary rules systems for miniatures-based wargaming. Supplements such as \"Battlesystem\" (1985 and 1989) and a new edition of \"Chainmail\" (2001) provided rule systems to handle battles between armies by using miniatures.\nDevelopment history.\nSources and influences.\nAn immediate predecessor of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" was a set of medieval miniature rules written by Jeff Perren. These were expanded by Gary Gygax, whose additions included a fantasy supplement, before the game was published as \"Chainmail\". When Dave Wesely entered the Army in 1970, his friend and fellow Napoleonics wargamer Dave Arneson began a medieval variation of Wesely's Braunstein games, where players control individuals instead of armies. Arneson used \"Chainmail\" to resolve combat. As play progressed, Arneson added such innovations as character classes, experience points, level advancement, armor class, and others. Having partnered previously with Gygax on \"Don't Give Up the Ship!\", Arneson introduced Gygax to his Blackmoor game and the two then collaborated on developing \"The Fantasy Game\", the game that became \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", with the final writing and preparation of the text being done by Gygax. The name was chosen by Gygax's two-year-old daughter Cindy; upon being presented with a number of choices of possible names, she exclaimed, \"Oh Daddy, I like Dungeons &amp; Dragons best!\", although less prevalent versions of the story gave credit to his then wife Mary Jo.\nMany \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" elements appear in hobbies of the mid-to-late 20th century. For example, character-based role-playing can be seen in improvisational theater. Game-world simulations were well developed in wargaming. Fantasy milieux specifically designed for gaming could be seen in Glorantha's board games, among others. Ultimately, however, \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" represents a unique blending of these elements.\nThe world of \"D&amp;D\" was influenced by world mythology, history, pulp fiction, and contemporary fantasy novels, as listed by Gygax in the Appendix N of the original \"Dungeon Master's Guide\". The importance of Tolkien's works \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Hobbit\" as an influence on \"D&amp;D\" is controversial. The presence in the game of halflings, elves, half-elves, dwarves, orcs, rangers, and the like, as well as the convention of diverse adventurers forming a group, draw comparisons to these works. The resemblance was even closer before the threat of copyright action from Tolkien Enterprises prompted the name changes of hobbit to 'halfling', ent to 'treant', and balrog to 'balor'. For many years, Gygax played down the influence of Tolkien on the development of the game. However, in an interview in 2000, he acknowledged that Tolkien's work had a \"strong impact\" though he also said that the list of other influential authors was long.\nThe \"D&amp;D\" magic system, in which wizards memorize spells that are used up once cast and must be re-memorized the next day, was heavily influenced by the \"Dying Earth\" stories and novels of Jack Vance. The original alignment system (which grouped all characters and creatures into 'Law', 'Neutrality' and 'Chaos') was derived from the novel \"Three Hearts and Three Lions\" by Poul Anderson. A troll described in this work influenced the \"D&amp;D\" definition of that monster. The Labyrinth of the Greek myth of the Minotaur has been seen as an inspiration for the game's use of dungeons as monster lairs.\nOther influences include the works of Robert E. Howard, Edgar Rice Burroughs, A. Merritt, H. P. Lovecraft, Fritz Leiber, L. Sprague de Camp, Fletcher Pratt, Roger Zelazny, and Michael Moorcock. Monsters, spells, and magic items used in the game have been inspired by hundreds of individual works such as A. E. van Vogt's \"Black Destroyer\", Coeurl (the Displacer Beast), Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\" (vorpal sword) and the Book of Genesis (the clerical spell 'Blade Barrier' was inspired by the \"flaming sword which turned every way\" at the gates of Eden).\nEdition history.\n\"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" has gone through several revisions. Parallel versions and inconsistent naming practices can make it difficult to distinguish between the different editions.\nOriginal game.\nThe original \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", now referred to as \"OD&amp;D\", is a small box set of three booklets published in 1974. With a very limited production budget of only $2000\u2014with only $100 budgeted for artwork\u2014it is amateurish in production and assumes the player is familiar with wargaming. Nevertheless, it grew rapidly in popularity, first among wargamers and then expanding to a more general audience of college and high school students. Roughly 1,000 copies of the game were sold in the first year, followed by 3,000 in 1975, and many more in the following years. This first set went through many printings and was supplemented with several official additions, such as the original \"Greyhawk\" and \"Blackmoor\" supplements (both 1975), as well as magazine articles in TSR's official publications and many fanzines.\nTwo-pronged strategy.\nIn early 1977, TSR created the first element of a two-pronged strategy that would divide \"D&amp;D\" for nearly two decades. A \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set\" boxed edition was introduced that cleaned up the presentation of the essential rules, makes the system understandable to the general public, and was sold in a package that could be stocked in toy stores. Later in 1977, the first part of \"Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" (\"AD&amp;D\") was published, which brought together the various published rules, options and corrections, then expanded them into a definitive, unified game for hobbyist gamers. TSR marketed them as an introductory game for new players and a more complex game for experienced ones; the \"Basic Set\" directed players who exhausted the possibilities of that game to switch to the advanced rules.\nAs a result of this parallel development, the basic game includes many rules and concepts which contradicted comparable ones in \"AD&amp;D\". John Eric Holmes, the editor of the basic game, preferred a lighter tone with more room for personal improvisation. \"AD&amp;D\", on the other hand, was designed to create a tighter, more structured game system than the loose framework of the original game. Between 1977 and 1979, three hardcover rulebooks, commonly referred to as the \"core rulebooks\", were released: the \"Player's Handbook\" (PHB), the \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" (DMG), and the \"Monster Manual\" (MM). Several supplementary books were published throughout the 1980s, notably \"Unearthed Arcana\" (1985), which included a large number of new rules. Confusing matters further, the original \"D&amp;D\" boxed set remained in publication until 1979, since it remained a healthy seller for TSR.\nRevised editions.\nIn the 1980s, the rules for \"Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" and \"basic\" \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" remained separate, each developing along different paths.\nIn 1981, the basic version of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" was revised by Tom Moldvay to make it even more novice-friendly. It was promoted as a continuation of the original \"D&amp;D\" tone, whereas \"AD&amp;D\" was promoted as an advancement of the mechanics. An accompanying \"Expert Set\", originally written by David \"Zeb\" Cook, allows players to continue using the simpler ruleset beyond the early levels of play. In 1983, revisions of those sets by Frank Mentzer were released, revising the presentation of the rules to a more tutorial format. These were followed by \"Companion\" (1983), \"Master\" (1985), and \"Immortals\" (1986) sets. Each set covers game play for more powerful characters than the previous. The first four sets were compiled in 1991 as a single hardcover book, the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia\", which was released alongside a new introductory boxed set.\n\"Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Edition\" was published in 1989, again as three core rulebooks; the primary designer was David \"Zeb\" Cook. The \"Monster Manual\" was replaced by the \"Monstrous Compendium\", a loose-leaf binder that was subsequently replaced by the hardcover \"Monstrous Manual\" in 1993. In 1995, the core rulebooks were slightly revised, although still referred to by TSR as the 2nd Edition, and a series of \"Player's Option\" manuals were released as optional rulebooks.\nThe release of \"AD&amp;D 2nd Edition\" deliberately excluded some aspects of the game that had attracted negative publicity. References to demons and devils, sexually suggestive artwork, and playable, evil-aligned character types\u00a0\u2013 such as assassins and half-orcs\u00a0\u2013 were removed. The edition moved away from a theme of 1960s and 1970s \"sword and sorcery\" fantasy fiction to a mixture of medieval history and mythology. The rules underwent minor changes, including the addition of non-weapon proficiencies\u00a0\u2013 skill-like abilities that appear in first edition supplements. The game's magic spells are divided into schools and spheres. A major difference was the promotion of various game settings beyond that of traditional fantasy. This included blending fantasy with other genres, such as horror (Ravenloft), science fiction (Spelljammer), and apocalyptic (Dark Sun), as well as alternative historical and non-European mythological settings.\nWizards of the Coast.\nIn 1997, a near-bankrupt TSR was purchased by Wizards of the Coast. Following three years of development, \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" 3rd edition was released in 2000. The new release folded the Basic and Advanced lines back into a single unified game. It was the largest revision of the \"D&amp;D\" rules to date and served as the basis for a multi-genre role-playing system designed around 20-sided dice, called the d20 System. The 3rd Edition rules were designed to be internally consistent and less restrictive than previous editions of the game, allowing players more flexibility to create the characters they wanted to play. Skills and feats were introduced into the core rules to encourage further customization of characters. The new rules standardized the mechanics of action resolution and combat. In 2003, \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons v.3.5\" was released as a revision of the 3rd Edition rules. This release incorporated hundreds of rule changes, mostly minor, and expanded the core rulebooks.\nIn early 2005, Wizards of the Coast's R&amp;D team started to develop \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" 4th Edition, prompted mainly by the feedback obtained from the \"D&amp;D\" playing community and a desire to make the game faster, more intuitive, and with a better play experience than under the 3rd Edition. The new game was developed through a number of design phases spanning from May 2005 until its release. \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" 4th Edition was announced at Gen Con in August 2007, and the initial three core books were released June 6, 2008. 4th Edition streamlined the game into a simplified form and introduced numerous rules changes. Many character abilities were restructured into \"Powers\". These altered the spell-using classes by adding abilities that could be used at will, per encounter, or per day. Likewise, non-magic-using classes were provided with parallel sets of options. Software tools, including player character and monster-building programs, became a major part of the game. This edition added the \"D&amp;D Encounters\" program; a weekly event held at local stores designed to draw players back to the game by giving \"the busy gamer the chance to play \"D&amp;D\" once a week as their schedules allow. In the past, \"D&amp;D\" games could take months, even years, and players generally had to attend every session so that the story flow wasn't interrupted. With \"Encounters\", players can come and go as they choose and new players can easily be integrated into the story continuity\".\n5th Edition.\nOn January 9, 2012, Wizards of the Coast announced that it was working on a 5th edition of the game. The company planned to take suggestions from players and let them playtest the rules. Public playtesting began on May 24, 2012. At Gen Con 2012 in August, Mike Mearls, lead developer for 5th Edition, said that Wizards of the Coast had received feedback from more than 75,000 playtesters, but that the entire development process would take two years, adding, \"I can't emphasize this enough\u00a0... we're very serious about taking the time we need to get this right.\" The release of the 5th Edition, coinciding with \"D&amp;D\"s 40th anniversary, occurred in the second half of 2014.\nSince the release of 5th edition, dozens of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" books have been published including new rulebooks, campaign guides and adventure modules. 2017 had \"the most number of players in its history\u201412 million to 15 million in North America alone\". Mary Pilon, for \"Bloomberg\", reported that sales of 5th edition \"Dungeon &amp; Dragons\" \"were up 41 percent in 2017 from the year before, and soared another 52 percent in 2018, the game's biggest sales year yet. [...] In 2017, 9 million people watched others play D&amp;D on Twitch, immersing themselves in the world of the game without ever having to pick up a die or cast a spell\". In 2018, Wizards of the Coast organized a massive live-stream event, the Stream of Many Eyes, where ten live-streamed sessions of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" were performed on Twitch over three days. This event won the Content Marketing Institute's 2019 award for best \"In-Person (Event) Content Marketing Strategy\". \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" continued to have a strong presence on Twitch throughout 2019; this included a growing number of celebrity players and dungeon masters, such as Joe Manganiello, Deborah Ann Woll and Stephen Colbert. Wizards of the Coast has created, produced and sponsored multiple web series featuring \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\". These shows have typically aired on the official \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" Twitch and YouTube channels.\nIn 2020, Wizards of the Coast announced that \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" had its 6th annual year of growth in 2019 with a \"300 percent increase in sales of their introductory box sets, as well as a 65% increase on sales in Europe, a rate which has more than quadrupled since 2014\". In terms of player demographics in 2019, 39% of identified as female and 61% identified as male. 40% of players are considered Gen Z (24 years old or younger), 34% of players are in the age range of 25\u201334 and 26% of players are aged 35+. In January 2021, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that according to Liz Schuh, head of publishing and licensing for Dungeons &amp; Dragons, \"revenue was up 35% in 2020 compared with 2019, the seventh consecutive year of growth,\" and in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, \"virtual play rose 86% [...] aided by online platforms such as Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds\". Sarah Parvini, for the \"Los Angeles Times\", wrote, \"players and scholars attribute the game's resurgent popularity not only to the longueurs of the pandemic, but also to its reemergence in pop culture\u2014on the Netflix series \"Stranger Things\", whose main characters play D&amp;D in a basement; on the sitcom \"The Big Bang Theory\"; or via the host of celebrities who display their love for the game online\".\nFollowing an apology issued by Wizards of the Coast for offensive and racist material included in \"\" and the announced revisions to the product in September 2022, Christopher Perkins \u2013 Wizards' game design architect \u2013 announced a new inclusion review process for the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" studio in November 2022. This process will now require \"every word, illustration, and map\" to be reviewed at several steps in development \"by multiple outside cultural consultants prior to publication\". The previous process only included cultural consultants at the discretion of the product lead for a project. All products being reprinted will also go through this new review process and be updated as needed.\n2024 revision.\nIn September 2021, it was announced that a backwards compatible \"evolution\" of 5th edition would be released in 2024 to mark the 50th anniversary of the game. In August 2022, Wizards announced that the next phase of major changes for \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" would occur under the \"One D&amp;D\" initiative which includes a public playtest of the next version of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" and an upcoming virtual tabletop simulator with 3D environments developed using Unreal Engine. Revised editions of the \"Player's Handbook\", \"Monster Manual\", and \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" were scheduled to be released in 2024; the revised \"Player's Handbook\" and \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" were released in 2024, with the \"Monster Manual\" coming in 2025.\nIn April 2022, Hasbro announced that Wizards would acquire the D&amp;D Beyond digital toolset and game companion from Fandom; the official transfer to Wizards occurred in May 2022. At the Hasbro Investor Event in October 2022, it was announced that Dan Rawson, former COO of Microsoft Dynamics 365, was appointed to the newly created position of Senior Vice President for the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" brand; Rawson will act as the new head of the franchise. Chase Carter of \"Dicebreaker\" highlighted that Rawson's role is \"part of Wizards' plans to apply more resources to the digital side of D&amp;D\" following the purchase of D&amp;D Beyond by Hasbro earlier in the year. Wizards of the Coast CEO Cynthia Williams and Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks, at a December 2022 Hasbro investor-focused web seminar, called the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" brand \"under monetized\". They highlighted the high engagement of fans with the brand, however, the majority of spending is by Dungeon Masters who are only roughly 20% of the player base. Williams commented that the increased investment in digital will \"unlock the type of recurrent spending you see in digital games\". At the July 2024 Hasbro investor meeting, Cocks stated \"that digital revenue on D&amp;D Beyond 'accounts for over half' of\" the total earnings from \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\". Carter, now for \"Rascal\", commented that \"we know physical books sell poorly, and even if pre-orders for the 2024 core books are, uh, 'solid', according to the CEO, it's evident that Hasbro holds little faith in analog games clotting the money bleed elsewhere in the company's structure\".\nLicensing.\nEarly in the game's history, TSR took no action against small publishers' production of \"D&amp;D\" compatible material and even licensed Judges Guild to produce \"D&amp;D\" materials for several years, such as \"City State of the Invincible Overlord.\" This attitude changed in the mid-1980s when TSR took legal action to try to prevent others from publishing compatible material. This angered many fans and led to resentment by the other gaming companies. Although TSR took legal action against several publishers in an attempt to restrict third-party usage, it never brought any court cases to completion, instead settling out of court in every instance. TSR itself ran afoul of intellectual property law in several cases.\nWith the launch of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\"'s 3rd Edition, Wizards of the Coast made the d20 System available under the Open Game License (OGL) and d20 System trademark license. Under these licenses, authors were free to use the d20 System when writing games and game supplements. The OGL has allowed a wide range of unofficial commercial derivative work based on the mechanics of \"Dungeons and Dragons\" to be produced since 2000; it is credited with increasing the market share of d20 products\"\" and leading to a \"boom in the RPG industry in the early 2000s\".\nWith the release of the 4th Edition, Wizards of the Coast introduced its Game System License, which represented a significant restriction compared to the very open policies embodied by the OGL. In part as a response to this, some publishers (such as Paizo Publishing with its \"Pathfinder Roleplaying Game\") who previously produced materials in support of the \"D&amp;D\" product line, decided to continue supporting the 3rd Edition rules, thereby competing directly with Wizards of the Coast. Others, such as Kenzer &amp; Company, returned to the practice of publishing unlicensed supplements and arguing that copyright law does not allow Wizards of the Coast to restrict third-party usage.\nDuring the 2000s, there has been a trend towards reviving and recreating older editions of \"D&amp;D\", known as the Old School Revival. This, in turn, inspired the creation of \"retro-clones\", games that more closely recreate the original rule sets, using material placed under the OGL along with non-copyrightable mechanical aspects of the older rules to create a new presentation of the games.\nAlongside the publication of the 5th Edition, Wizards of the Coast established a two-pronged licensing approach. The core of the 5th Edition rules have been made available under the OGL, while publishers and independent creators have also been given the opportunity to create licensed materials directly for Dungeons &amp; Dragons and associated properties like the Forgotten Realms under a program called the DM's Guild. The DM's Guild does not function under the OGL, but uses a community agreement intended to foster liberal cooperation among content creators.\nWizards of the Coast has started to release 5th Edition products that tie into other intellectual properties\u2014such as \"\" with the \"Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica\" (2018) and \"Mythic Odysseys of Theros\" (2020) source books. Two 5th Edition starter box sets based on TV shows, \"Stranger Things\" and \"Rick and Morty\", were released in 2019. Source books based on \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" live play series have also been released: \"Acquisitions Incorporated\" (2019) and \"Explorer's Guide to Wildemount\" (2020).\nBetween November and December 2022, there was reported speculation that Wizards was planning on discontinuing the OGL for \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" based on unconfirmed leaks. In response to the speculation, Wizards stated in November 2022: \"We will continue to support the thousands of creators making third-party D&amp;D content with the release of One D&amp;D in 2024.\" Limited details on the update to the OGL, including the addition of revenue reporting and required royalties, were released by Wizards in December 2022. Linda Codega, for \"Io9\" in January 2023, reported on the details from a leaked full copy of the OGL 1.1 including updated terms such as no longer authorizing use of the OGL1.0. Codega highlighted that \"if the original license is in fact no longer viable, every single licensed publisher will be affected by the new agreement. [...] The main takeaway from the leaked OGL 1.1 draft document is that WotC is keeping power close at hand\". A week after the leak, Wizards issued a response which walked back several changes to the OGL; this response did not contain the updated OGL. The Motley Fool highlighted that \"Hasbro pulled an abrupt volte-face and had its subsidiary D&amp;D Beyond publish a mea culpa on its website\". On January 27, 2023, following feedback received during the open comment period for the draft OGL1.2, Wizards of the Coast announced that the System Reference Document 5.1 (SRD 5.1) would be released under an irrevocable Creative Commons license (CC BY 4.0) effective immediately and Wizards would no longer pursue deauthorizing the OGL1.0a.\nReception.\nEric Goldberg reviewed \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" in \"Ares Magazine\" #1 (March 1980), rating it a 6 out of 9, and commented that \"\"Dungeons and Dragons\" is an impressive achievement based on the concept alone, and also must be credited with cementing the marriage between the fantasy genre and gaming.\" \nEric Goldberg again reviewed \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" in \"Ares Magazine\" #3 and commented that \"\"D&amp;D\" is the FRP game played most often in most places.\" In the 1980 book \"The Complete Book of Wargames\", game designer Jon Freeman asked, \"What can be said about a phenomenon? Aside from \"Tactics II\" and possibly \"PanzerBlitz\" (the first modern tactical wargame), this is the most significant war game since H.G. Wells.\" However, Freeman did have significant issues with the game, pointing out, \"On the other hand, beginning characters are without exception dull, virtually powerless, and so fragile\" which was not encouraging for \"newcomers.\" He also called the magic system \"stupid\" feeling that many of the spells were \"redundant\" and \"the effects of the majority are hopelessly vague.\" He found essential elements such as saving throws, hit points, and experience points \"undefined or poorly explained; the ratio of substance to \"holes\" compares unfavorably with the head of a tennis racquet.\" He also noted the rules were \"presented in the most illiterate display of poor grammar, misspellings, and typographical errors in professional wargaming.\" Despite all these issues, Freeman concluded, \"As it was given birth, it is fascinating but misshapen; in its best incarnations, it's perhaps the most exciting and attractive specimen alive.\"\nThe game had over three million players worldwide by 1981, and copies of the rules were selling at a rate of about 750,000 per year by 1984. Beginning with a French language edition in 1982, \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" has been translated into many languages beyond the original English. By 1992, the game had been translated into 14 languages and sold over copies in 44 countries worldwide. By 2004, consumers had spent more than on \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" products and the game had been played by more than 20\u00a0million people. As many as six million people played the game in 2007. David M. Ewalt, in his book \"Of Dice and Men\" (2013), praised that the game allows for a personal fantastical experience and stated that \"even though it's make-believe, the catharsis is real.\"\nAcclaim.\nThe various editions of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" have won many Origins Awards, including \"All Time Best Roleplaying Rules of 1977\", \"Best Roleplaying Rules of 1989\", \"Best Roleplaying Game of 2000\" and \"Best Role Playing Game and Best Role Playing Supplement of 2014\" for the flagship editions of the game. Both \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" and \"Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" are Origins Hall of Fame Games inductees as they were deemed sufficiently distinct to merit separate inclusion on different occasions. The independent \"Games\" magazine placed \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" on their \"Games 100\" list from 1980 through 1983, then entered the game into the magazine's Hall of Fame in 1984. \"Games\" magazine included \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" in their \"Top 100 Games of 1980\", saying \"The more players, the merrier.\" \"Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" was ranked 2nd in the 1996 reader poll of \"Arcane\" magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time. \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in 2016 and into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 2017.\nLater editions.\nLater editions would lead to inevitable comparisons between the game series. Scott Taylor for \"Black Gate\" in 2013 rated \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" as #1 in the top ten role-playing games of all time, saying \"The grand-daddy of all games, \"D&amp;D\" just keeps on going, and although there might always be 'edition wars' between players, that just says that it effectively stays within the consciousness of multiple generations of players as a relevant piece of entertainment.\" \nGriffin McElroy, for \"Polygon\" in 2014, wrote: \"The game has shifted in the past four decades, bouncing between different rules sets, philosophies and methods of play. Role-playing, character customization and real-life improvisational storytelling has always been at the game's core, but how those ideas are interpreted by the game system has changed drastically edition-to-edition\". Dieter Bohn, for \"The Verge\" in 2014, wrote: \"Every few years there's been a new version of \"D&amp;D\" that tries to address the shortcomings of the previous version and also make itself more palatable to its age. [...] The third edition got a reputation (which it didn't necessarily deserve) for being too complex and rules-focused. The fourth edition got a reputation (which it didn't necessarily deserve) for being too focused on miniatures and grids, too mechanical. Meanwhile, the company that owns \"D&amp;D\" had released a bunch of its old material for free as a service to fans, and some of that was built up into a competing game called \"Pathfinder\". \"Pathfinder\" ultimately became more popular, by some metrics, than \"D&amp;D\" itself\". Bohn highlighted that the 5th Edition was \"designed for one purpose: to bring \"D&amp;D\" back to its roots and win back everybody who left during the edition wars\". Henry Glasheen, for \"SLUG Magazine\" in 2015, highlighted that after jumping ship during the 4th Edition era he was drawn back to \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" with 5th Edition and he considers it \"the new gold standard for D20-based tabletop RPGs\". Glasheen wrote \"Fifth Edition is a compelling reason to get excited about D&amp;D again\" and \"while some will welcome the simplicity, I fully expect that plenty of people will stick to whatever system suits them best. However, this edition is easily my favorite, ranking even higher than D&amp;D 3.5, my first love in D&amp;D\".\nChristian Hoffer, for \"ComicBook.com\" in 2022, highlighted the continuing fan debate on \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" and \"Pathfinder's\" current editions which centers on \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" 5th Edition's market dominance. Hoffer wrote, \"The reality is that \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons Fifth Edition\" is likely the most popular tabletop roleplaying game ever made, even more so than previous editions of the games. 5E has brought millions of new players to tabletop roleplaying games. Many of those newer players have never heard of other roleplaying games, even popular ones like \"Vampire: The Masquerade\" or \"Cyberpunk\" or \"Pathfinder.\" [...] Many content creators and publishers see 5E as their main path to survival and relevance even if it's not their preferred gaming system\". In December 2023, James Whitbrook of \"Gizmodo\" highlighted \"\"D&amp;D\"'s continued social influence\" with the release of related media such as the film \"\", the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Adventures\" FAST channel, and the video game \"Baldur's Gate 3\" with the video game's \"blockbuster success\" credited \"for a 40% increase in Wizards of the Coast's earnings over 2022\". However, Whitbrook opined that not even these successes \"could save \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" from the greed of its owners\" with the OGL controversy and major layoffs by Hasbro bookending \"what should've been one of the greatest years for \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" the game has ever seen\u2014more popular than ever, more accessible than ever, more culturally relevant than ever\u2014and in doing so transformed it into a golden era sullied with dark marks, overshadowed by grim caveats, a reflection that those with the most power in these spaces never really take the lessons they espoused to learn from their mistakes\".\nMoral panic.\nAt various times in its history, \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" has received negative publicity, in particular from some Christian groups, for alleged promotion of such practices as devil worship, witchcraft, suicide, and murder, and for the presence of naked breasts in drawings of female humanoids in the original \"AD&amp;D\" manuals (mainly monsters such as harpies, succubi, etc.). These controversies led TSR to remove many potentially controversial references and artwork when releasing the 2nd Edition of \"AD&amp;D\". Many of these references, including the use of the names \"devils\" and \"demons\", were reintroduced in the 3rd edition. The moral panic over the game led to problems for fans of \"D&amp;D\" who faced social ostracism, unfair treatment, and false association with the occult and Satanism, regardless of an individual fan's actual religious affiliation and beliefs. However, the controversy was also beneficial in evoking the Streisand Effect by giving the game widespread notoriety that significantly increased sales in the early 1980s in defiance of the moral panic.\n\"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" has been the subject of rumors regarding players having difficulty separating fantasy from reality, even leading to psychotic episodes. The most notable of these was the saga of James Dallas Egbert III, the facts of which were fictionalized in the novel \"Mazes and Monsters\" and later made into a TV movie in 1982 starring Tom Hanks. William Dear, the private investigator hired by the Egbert family to find their son when he went missing at college, wrote a book titled \"The Dungeon Master\" (1984) refuting any connection with D&amp;D and Egbert's personal issues. The game was blamed for some of the actions of Chris Pritchard, who was convicted in 1990 of murdering his stepfather. Research by various psychologists, starting with Armando Simon, has concluded that no harmful effects are related to the playing of \"D&amp;D\". \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" has also been cited as encouraging people to socialize weekly or biweekly, teaching problem solving skills, which can be beneficial in adult life, and teaching positive moral decisions.\nLater criticism.\n\"D&amp;D\" has been compared unfavorably to other role-playing games of its time. Writing for \"Slate\" in 2008, Erik Sofge makes unfavorable comparisons between the violent incentives of \"D&amp;D\" and the more versatile role-playing experience of \"GURPS\". He claims that \"for decades, gamers have argued that since D&amp;D came first, its lame, morally repulsive experience system can be forgiven. But the damage is still being done: New generations of players are introduced to RPGs as little more than a collective fantasy of massacre.\" This criticism generated backlash from \"D&amp;D\" fans. Writing for \"Ars Technica\", Ben Kuchera responded that Sofge had experienced a \"small-minded Dungeon Master who only wanted to kill things\", and that better game experiences are possible.\nIn 2020, \"Polygon\" reported that \"the D&amp;D team announced that it would be making changes to portions of its 5th edition product line that fans have called out for being insensitive\". Sebastian Modak, for \"The Washington Post\", reported that the tabletop community has widely approved these changes. Modak wrote that \"in its statement addressing mistakes around portrayals of different peoples in the D&amp;D universe, Wizards of the Coast highlighted its recent efforts in bringing in more diverse voices to craft the new \"D&amp;D\" sourcebooks coming out in 2021. [...] These conversations\u2014around depictions of race and alleged treatment of employees of marginalized backgrounds and identities\u2014have encouraged players to seek out other tabletop roleplaying experiences\". Matthew Gault, for \"Wired\", reported positively on the roundtable discussions Wizards of the Coast has hosted with fans and community leaders on diversity and inclusion. However, Gault also highlighted that other efforts, such as revisions to old material and the release of new material, have been less great and at times minimal. Gault wrote, \"WotC appears to be trying to change things, but it keeps stumbling, and it's often the fans who pick up the pieces. [...] WotC is trying to make changes, but it often feels like lip service. [...] The loudest voices criticizing D&amp;D right now are doing it out of love. They don't want to see it destroyed, they want it to change with the times\". However, in 2022, academic Christopher Ferguson stated that the game \"was not associated with greater ethnocentrism (one facet of racism) attitudes\" after he conducted a survey study of 308 adults (38.2% non-White, and 17% \"Dungeons and Dragons\" players). Ferguson concluded that Wizards of the Coast may be responding to a moral panic similar to that surrounding Satanism in the 1990s. In the 2024 update to 5e, character \"race\" (such as dwarf, elf, or human) was changed to \"species.\"\nBetween November and December 2022, there was reported speculation that Wizards was planning to discontinue the Open Game License for \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" based on unconfirmed leaks. Following an initial response to the speculation by Wizards in November 2022, the company released limited details on the update to the OGL in December 2022. Linda Codega, writing for \"Io9\", reported on the details from a leaked full copy of the OGL 1.1 on January 5, 2023. Codega highlighted that \"every single licensed publisher will be affected by the new agreement. [...] The main takeaway from the leaked OGL 1.1 draft document is that WotC is keeping power close at hand\". \"ICv2\" commented that the leaked OGL had several controversial parts. Following this leak, numerous news and industry-focused outlets reported on negative reactions from both fans and professional content creators. \"TheStreet\" highlighted that \"the company's main competitors\" quickly pivoted away from the OGL in the time it took Wizards to settle on a response. \"Starburst\" commented that \"historically when the owners of \"Dungeons and Dragons\" attempt to restrict what people can do with the game, it leads to a boom in other tabletop roleplaying games. This is happening right now\". \"TheStreet\" also commented that Wizards united its \"entire player base\" against it; both \"TheStreet\" and \"Io9\" highlighted the movement to boycott D&amp;D Beyond and mass subscription cancellations with \"Io9\" stating that the \"immediate financial consequences\" forced a response by Wizards. \"Io9\" reported that Wizards' internal messaging on the response to the leak was this was a fan overreaction. In the ensuing weeks, Wizards walked back changes to the OGL and solicited public feedback before pivoting away from the OGL to release the (SRD 5.1) under an irrevocable creative commons license (CC BY 4.0). Edwin Evans-Thirlwell of \"The Washington Post\" wrote that \"pushback from fans, who criticized WotC's response as far from an apology and a dismissal of their legitimate concerns, led WotC to backpedal further\" and that the company \"appears to have committed an irreversible act of self-sabotage in trying to replace [the OGL] \u2014 squandering the prestige accumulated over 20 years in a matter of weeks\". Both \"Io9\" and \"ComicBook.com\" called the major concessions \u2013 releasing the SRD 5.1 under the creative commons and no longer deauthorizing the OGL1.0a \u2013 announced by Wizards a \"huge victory\" for the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" community.\nLegacy and influence.\n\"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" was the first modern role-playing game and it established many of the conventions that have dominated the genre. Particularly notable are the use of dice as a game mechanic, character record sheets, use of numerical attributes, and gamemaster-centered group dynamics. Within months of the release of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", new role-playing game writers and publishers began releasing their own role-playing games, with most of these being in the fantasy genre. Some of the earliest other role-playing games inspired by \"D&amp;D\" include \"Tunnels &amp; Trolls\" (1975), \"Empire of the Petal Throne\" (1975), and \"Chivalry &amp; Sorcery\" (1976). The game's commercial success was a factor that led to lawsuits regarding the distribution of royalties between original creators Gygax and Arneson. Gygax later became embroiled in a political struggle for control of TSR which culminated in a court battle and Gygax's decision to sell his ownership interest in the company in 1985.\nThe role-playing movement initiated by \"D&amp;D\" would lead to the release of the science fiction game \"Traveller\" (1977), the fantasy game \"RuneQuest\" (1978), and subsequent game systems such as Chaosium's \"Call of Cthulhu\" (1981), \"Champions\" (1982), \"GURPS\" (1986), and \"\" (1991). \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" and the games it influenced fed back into the genre's origin\u00a0\u2013 miniatures wargames\u00a0\u2013 with combat strategy games like \"Warhammer Fantasy Battles\". \"D&amp;D\" also had a large impact on modern video games.\nDirector Jon Favreau credits \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" with giving him \"...\u00a0a really strong background in imagination, storytelling, understanding how to create tone and a sense of balance.\" ND Stevenson and the crew of \"She-Ra and the Princesses of Power\" were strongly influenced by \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", with Stevenson calling it basically a D&amp;D campaign, with Adora, Glimmer, and Bow falling into \"specific classes in D&amp;D\". A \"D&amp;D\" campaign held among id Software staff in the early 1990s featured a demonic invasion, a warrior named \"Quake\" and a magic item named \"Daikatana\". John Romero has credited the campaign with inspiring many of his video games of the era, including \"Doom\", \"Quake\" and \"Daikatana\".\nCurtis D. Carbonell, in the 2019 book \"Dread Trident: Tabletop Role-Playing Games and the Modern Fantastic\", wrote: \"Negative association with earlier niche 'nerd' culture have reversed. 5e has become inclusive in its reach of players, after years of focusing on a white, male demographic. [...] At its simplest, the game system now encourages different types of persons to form a party not just to combat evil [...] but to engage in any number of adventure scenarios\". Academic Emma French, in \"Real Life in Real Time: Live Streaming Culture\" (2023), commented on the impact of actual play on the broader \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" gaming culture \u2013 \"actual play media circumvents D&amp;D's insulated or exclusionary aspects, skewing away from 'basement dwelling nerds' in favor of a networked, global fandom. Live streaming is now a means of introducing individuals to the game, bringing it into the mainstream at a time when other geek pursuits have also achieved wider visibility and popularity\". French highlighted that in 2020 \"no actual play live streams hosted by the official DnD channel featured an all-male cast\u2014showing a massive shift from the brand ambassadors endorsed by Wizards of the Coast\" previously. French argued that not only has the more accessible and inclusive actual play landscape impacted the gaming culture but it has also impacted the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" product itself from the promotion campaign of \"Tasha's Cauldron of Everything\" featuring \"diverse nerd celebrities\" to \"direct action taken against previous exclusionary behavior\" as seen in Wizards of the Coast statements on diversity and \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\". French wrote, \"as actual play live streams broaden the range of customers that D&amp;D can market itself to, it may enact real, seismic change to the mainstream perception of geek identity, and contribute to a push for diverse representation within geek subculture as a whole\".\nRelated products.\n\"D&amp;D\"'s commercial success has led to many other related products, including \"Dragon\" and \"Dungeon\" magazines, an animated television series, a film series, an off-Broadway stage , an official role-playing soundtrack, novels, both ongoing and limited series licensed comics, and numerous computer and video games. Hobby and toy stores sell dice, miniatures, adventures, and other game aids related to \"D&amp;D\" and its game offspring.\nIn November 2023, Hasbro's Entertainment One launched the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons Adventures\" FAST channel, available on platforms such as Amazon Freevee and Plex, which features new actual play web series, reruns of the animated \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" series, and reruns of other \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" web series.\nIn popular culture.\n\"D&amp;D\" grew in popularity through the late 1970s and 1980s. Numerous games, films, and cultural references based on \"D&amp;D\" or \"D&amp;D\"-like fantasies, characters or adventures have been ubiquitous since the end of the 1970s. \"D&amp;D\" players are (sometimes pejoratively) portrayed as the epitome of geekdom, and have become the basis of much geek and gamer humor and satire. Since the release of 5th edition, actual play web series and podcasts such as \"Critical Role\", \"Dimension 20\", and \"The Adventure Zone\", among many others, have experienced a growth in viewership and popularity. According to Hasbro CEO Brian Goldner, viewers on Twitch and YouTube spent over 150 million hours watching \"D&amp;D\" gameplay in 2020.\nFamous \"D&amp;D\" players include Pulitzer Prize-winning author Junot D\u00edaz, professional basketball player Tim Duncan, comedian Stephen Colbert, and actors Vin Diesel and Robin Williams. \"D&amp;D\" and its fans have been the subject of spoof films, including \"\".\nBibliography.\nUnknown author"}
{"id": "7941", "revid": "1271056834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7941", "title": "Double jeopardy", "text": "In jurisprudence, double jeopardy is a procedural defence (primarily in common law jurisdictions) that prevents an accused person from being tried again on the same (or similar) charges following an acquittal or conviction and in rare cases prosecutorial and/or judge misconduct in the same jurisdiction. Double jeopardy is a common concept in criminal law \u2013 in civil law, a similar concept is that of . The double jeopardy protection in criminal prosecutions bars only an identical prosecution for the same offence except when the defendant is a servicemember as the courts have ruled that the military courts are a separate sovereign, therefore servicemembers can be held in two separate trials for exactly the same charges; however, a different offence may be charged on identical evidence at a second trial. \"Res judicata\" protection is stronger \u2013 it precludes any causes of action or claims that arise from a previously litigated subject matter.\nA variation in common law countries is the peremptory plea, which may take the specific forms of ('previously acquitted') or ('previously convicted'). These doctrines appear to have originated in ancient Roman law, in the broader principle ('not twice against the same').\nAvailability as a legal defence.\nIf a double jeopardy issue is raised, evidence will be placed before the court, which will typically rule as a preliminary matter whether the plea is substantiated; if it is, the projected trial will be prevented from proceeding. In some countries, certain exemptions are permitted. In Scotland, a new trial can be initiated if, for example, the acquitted has made a credible admission of guilt. Part of English law for over 800 years, it was partially abolished in England, Wales and Northern Ireland by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 where, following demand for change, serious offences may be re-tried following an acquittal if new and compelling evidence is found, and if the trial is found to be in the public's interest. In some countries, including Canada, Mexico, and the United States, the guarantee against being \"twice put in jeopardy\" is a constitutional right. In other countries, the protection is afforded by statute.\nIn common law countries, a defendant may enter a peremptory plea of ('previously acquitted') or ('previously convicted'), with the same effect.\nDouble jeopardy is not a principle of international law. It does not apply between different countries, unless having been contractually agreed on between those countries as, for example, in the European Union (Art. 54 Schengen Convention), and in various extradition treaties between two countries.\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\nThe 72 signatories and 166 parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognise, under Article 14 (7): \"No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again for an offence for which he has already been finally convicted or acquitted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of each country.\" However, it does not apply to prosecutions by two different sovereigns (unless the relevant extradition treaty expresses a prohibition).\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights.\nAll members of the Council of Europe (which includes nearly all European countries and every member of the European Union) have adopted the European Convention on Human Rights. The optional Protocol No. 7 to the convention, Article 4, protects against double jeopardy: \"No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again in criminal proceedings under the jurisdiction of the same State for an offence for which he or she has already been finally acquitted or convicted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of that State.\"\nAll EU states ratified this optional protocol except for Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. In those member states, national rules governing double jeopardy may or may not comply with the provision cited above.\nMember states may, however, implement legislation which allows the reopening of a case if new evidence is found or if there was a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings:\nIn many European countries, the prosecution may appeal an acquittal to a higher court. This is not regarded as double jeopardy, but as a continuation of the same case. The European Convention on Human Rights permits this by using the phrase \"finally acquitted or convicted\" as the trigger for prohibiting subsequent prosecution.\nBy country.\nAustralia.\nIn contrast to other common law nations, Australian double jeopardy law has been held to further prevent the prosecution for perjury following a previous acquittal where a finding of perjury would controvert the acquittal. This was confirmed in the case of \"R v Carroll\", where the police found new evidence convincingly disproving Carroll's sworn alibi two decades after he had been acquitted of murder charges in the death of Ipswich child Deidre Kennedy, and successfully prosecuted him for perjury. Public outcry following the overturn of his conviction (for perjury) by the High Court has led to widespread calls for reform of the law along the lines of the England and Wales legislation.\nDuring a Council of Australian Governments (COAG) meeting of 2007, model legislation to rework double jeopardy laws was drafted, but there was no formal agreement for each state to introduce it. All states have now chosen to introduce legislation that mirrors COAG's recommendations on \"fresh and compelling\" evidence.\nIn New South Wales, retrials of serious cases with a minimum sentence of 20 years or more are now possible even if the original trial preceded the 2006 reform. On 17 October 2006, the New South Wales Parliament passed legislation abolishing the rule against double jeopardy in cases where:\nOn 30 July 2008, South Australia also introduced legislation to scrap parts of its double jeopardy law, legalising retrials for serious offences with \"fresh and compelling\" evidence, or if the acquittal was tainted.\nIn Western Australia, amendments introduced on 8 September 2011 allow retrial if \"new and compelling\" evidence is found. It applies to serious offences where the penalty is life imprisonment or imprisonment for 14 years or more. Acquittal because of tainting (witness intimidation, jury tampering, or perjury) also permits retrial.\nIn Tasmania, on 19 August 2008, amendments were introduced to allow retrial in serious cases if there is \"fresh and compelling\" evidence.\nIn Victoria on 21 December 2011, legislation was passed allowing new trials where there is \"fresh and compelling DNA evidence, where the person acquitted subsequently admits to the crime, or where it becomes clear that key witnesses have given false evidence\". However, retrial applications could only be made for serious offences such as murder, manslaughter, arson causing death, serious drug offences and aggravated forms of rape and armed robbery.\nIn Queensland on 18 October 2007, the double jeopardy laws were modified to allow a retrial where fresh and compelling evidence becomes available after an acquittal for murder or a \"tainted acquittal\" for a crime carrying a 25-year or more sentence. A \"tainted acquittal\" requires a conviction for an administration of justice offence, such as perjury, that led to the original acquittal.\nCanada.\nThe Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms includes provisions such as section 11(h) prohibiting double jeopardy. However, the prohibition only applies after an accused person has been \"finally\" convicted or acquitted. Canadian law allows the prosecution to appeal an acquittal based on legal errors. In rare circumstances, when a trial judge made all the factual findings necessary for a finding of guilt but misapplied the law, a court of appeal might also directly substitute an acquittal for a conviction. These cases are not considered double jeopardy because the appeal and the subsequent conviction are deemed to be a continuation of the original trial.\nFor an appeal from an acquittal to be successful, the Supreme Court of Canada requires the Crown to show that an error in law was made during the trial and that it contributed to the verdict. It has been argued that this test is unfairly beneficial to the prosecution. For instance, in his book \"My Life in Crime and Other Academic Adventures\", Martin Friedland contends that the rule should be changed so that a retrial is granted only when the error is shown to be \"responsible\" for the verdict, not just a factor.\nThough the charter permits appeals of acquittals, there are still constitutional limits imposed on the scope of these appeals. In \"Corp. Professionnelle des M\u00e9decins v. Thibault\", the Supreme Court struck down a provision of Quebec law that allowed appellate courts to conduct a \"de novo\" review of both legal and factual findings. In doing so, it held that the scope of an appeal may not extend to challenging findings of fact where no legal error has been made. At this point, the court reasoned, the process ceases to be an appeal and instead becomes a new trial disguised as one.\nA notable example cited by critics of Canada's appeal system is the case of Guy Paul Morin, who was wrongfully convicted in his second trial after the acquittal in his first trial was vacated by the Supreme Court. Another notable use of the system occurred in the case of child murderer Guy Turcotte, the Quebec Court of Appeal overturned the initial verdict of not criminally responsible by reason of mental disorder and ordered a second trial after it found that the judge had erroneously instructed the jury. Turcotte was later convicted of second-degree murder in the second trial. Another well-known example is Henry Morgentaler, whose repeated acquittals by juries were overturned on appeal in multiple provinces.\nFrance.\nOnce all appeals have been exhausted on a case, the judgement is final and the action of the prosecution is closed (code of penal procedure, art. 6), except if the final ruling was forged. Prosecution for a crime already judged is impossible even if incriminating evidence has been found. However, a person who has been convicted may request another trial on the grounds of new exculpating evidence through a procedure known as \"r\u00e9vision\".\nFrench law allows the prosecution to appeal an acquittal.\nGermany.\nThe Basic Law (\"Grundgesetz\") for the Federal Republic of Germany protects against double jeopardy if a final verdict is pronounced. A verdict is final if nobody appeals against it.\nHowever, each trial party can appeal against a verdict in the first instance. The prosecution or the defendants can appeal against a judgement if they disagree with it. In this case, the trial starts again in the second instance, the court of appeal (\"Berufungsgericht\"), which reconsiders the facts and reasons and delivers a final judgement.\nIf one of the parties disagrees with the second instance's judgement, they can appeal it only for formal judicial reasons. The case will be checked in the third instance (\"Revisionsgericht\") to see whether all laws were correctly applied.\nThe rule applies to the whole \"historical event, which is usually considered a single historical course of actions the separation of which would seem unnatural\". This is true even if new facts come to light that indicate other crimes.\nThe Penal Procedural Code (\"Strafprozessordnung\") permits a retrial (\"Wiederaufnahmeverfahren\"), if it is in favour of the defendant or if the following events have happened:\nIn the case of an order of summary punishment, which can be issued by the court without a trial for lesser misdemeanours, there is a further exception:\nIn Germany, a felony is defined by \u00a7 12 (1) StGB as a crime that has a minimum of one year of imprisonment.\nIndia.\nA partial protection against double jeopardy is a Fundamental Right guaranteed under Article 20 (2) of the Constitution of India, which states \"No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once\". This provision enshrines the concept of \"autrefois convict\", that no one convicted of an offence can be tried or punished a second time. However, it does not extend to \"autrefois acquit\", and so if a person is acquitted of a crime he can be retried. In India, protection against \"autrefois acquit\" is a statutory right, not a fundamental one. Such protection is provided by provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure rather than by the Constitution.\nJapan.\nThe Constitution of Japan, which came into effect on 3 May 1947, states in Article 39 that\nHowever, in 1950, one defendant was found guilty in the District Court for crimes related to the election law and was sentenced to paying a fine. The prosecutor wanted a stronger sentence and appealed to the High Court. As a result, the defendant was sentenced to three months of imprisonment. He appealed to the Supreme Court on the grounds that the sentence was excessive when compared with precedents and that he had been placed in double jeopardy, which was in violation of Article 39. On 27 September 1950, all fifteen judges of the Supreme Court made the Grand Bench Decision to rule against the defendant and declared that a criminal proceeding in the District Court, High Court and Supreme Court is all one case and that there is no double jeopardy. In other words, if the prosecutor appeals against a judgement of not guilty or a guilty decision that they think does not impose a severe enough sentence, the defendant will not be placed in double jeopardy.\nOn 10 October 2003, the Supreme Court made a landmark decision in the area of double jeopardy. The case involved Article 235 of the Penal Code, which addresses \"simple larceny\", and Article 2 of the Law for Prevention and Disposition of Robbery, Theft, etc., which addresses \"habitual larceny\". The Court ruled that in the event that there are two trials for separate cases of simple larceny, it will not be considered double jeopardy, even if the prosecutor could have charged both of them as a single crime of habitual larceny. The defendant in this case had committed crimes of trespassing and simple larceny on 22 occasions. The defence counsel argued that the crimes were actually one offence of habitual larceny and that charging them as separate counts was double jeopardy. The Supreme Court ruled that it was within the prosecutor's discretion as to whether to charge the defendant with one count of habitual larceny or to charge them with multiple counts of trespassing and simple larceny. In either case, it is not considered double jeopardy.\nNetherlands.\nIn the Netherlands, the state prosecution can appeal a not-guilty verdict at the bench. New evidence can be applied during a retrial at a district court. Thus one can be tried twice for the same alleged crime. If one is convicted at the district court, the defence can make an appeal on procedural grounds to the supreme court. The supreme court might admit this complaint, and the case will be reopened yet again, at another district court. Again, new evidence might be introduced by the prosecution.\nOn 9 April 2013, the Dutch senate voted 36 \"yes\" versus 35 \"no\" in favour of a new law that allows the prosecutor to re-try a person who was found not guilty in court. This law is limited to offences in which the statute of limitations does not expire. These are offences that are punishable by at least 12 years of imprisonment, and other specific offences. Offences that have already expired (such as prior to the change in legislation that abolished the statute of limitations) cannot be retried. \nA retrial is only possible by ground of a 'novum': the situation in which new evidence has come to light and in which it seems that, had the judge known of this evidence, the defendant would have been prosecuted. The new evidence has to either be new technical evidence or a trustworthy confession by the defendant or their co-suspect.\nPakistan.\nArticle 13 of the Constitution of Pakistan protects a person from being punished or prosecuted more than once for the same offence. Section 403 of The Code of Criminal Procedure contemplates a situation where a person having once been tried by a Court of competent jurisdiction and acquitted by such court cannot be tried again for the same offence or for any other offence based on similar facts. The scope of section 403 is restricted to criminal proceedings and not to civil proceedings and departmental inquiries.\nSerbia.\nThis principle is incorporated into the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia and further elaborated in its Criminal Procedure Act.\nSouth Africa.\nThe Bill of Rights in the Constitution of South Africa forbids a retrial when there has already been an acquittal or a conviction.\nSouth Korea.\nArticle 13 of the South Korean constitution provides that no citizen shall be placed in double jeopardy.\nUnited Kingdom.\nEngland and Wales.\nDouble jeopardy has been permitted in England and Wales in certain (exceptional) circumstances since the Criminal Justice Act 2003.\nPre-2003.\nThe doctrines of \"autrefois acquit\" and \"autrefois convict\" persisted as part of the common law from the time of the Norman conquest of England; they were regarded as essential elements for protection of the subject's liberty and respect for due process of law in that there should be finality of proceedings. There were only three exceptions, all relatively recent, to the rules:\nIn \"Connelly v DPP\" [1964] AC 1254, the Law Lords ruled that a defendant could not be tried for any offence arising out of substantially the same set of facts relied upon in a previous charge of which he had been acquitted unless there are \"special circumstances\" proven by the prosecution. There is little case law on the meaning of \"special circumstances\", but it has been suggested that the emergence of new evidence would suffice.\nA defendant who had been convicted of an offence could be given a second trial for an aggravated form of that offence if the facts constituting the aggravation were discovered after the first conviction. By contrast, a person who had been acquitted of a lesser offence could not be tried for an aggravated form even if new evidence became available.\nPost-2003.\nFollowing the murder of Stephen Lawrence, the Macpherson Report recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be abrogated in murder cases, and that it should be possible to subject an acquitted murder suspect to a second trial if \"fresh and viable\" new evidence later came to light. The Law Commission later added its support to this in its report \"Double Jeopardy and Prosecution Appeals\" (2001). A parallel report into the criminal justice system by Lord Justice Auld, a past Senior Presiding Judge for England and Wales, had also commenced in 1999 and was published as the Auld Report six months after the Law Commission report. It opined that the Law Commission had been unduly cautious by limiting the scope to murder and that \"the exceptions should [...] extend to other grave offences punishable with life and/or long terms of imprisonment as Parliament might specify.\" 1999 was also the year of a highly publicised case in which a man, David Smith, was convicted of the murder of a prostitute after having been acquitted of the \"almost identical\" murder of sex worker Sarah Crump six years previously. Because of the double jeopardy laws that existed at the time, Smith could not be re-tried for Crump's murder, despite police insisting they were not looking for anybody else and that the case was closed and the BBC reporting that Smith had \"beat\" the earlier murder charge. \nBoth Jack Straw (then Home Secretary) and William Hague (then Leader of the Opposition) favoured the measures suggested by the Auld Report. These recommendations were implemented\u2014not uncontroversially at the time\u2014within the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and this provision came into force in April 2005. It opened certain serious crimes (including murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, rape, armed robbery, and serious drug crimes) to a retrial, regardless of when committed, with two conditions: the retrial must be approved by the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the Court of Appeal must agree to quash the original acquittal due to \"new and compelling evidence\". Then Director of Public Prosecutions, Ken Macdonald QC, said that he expected no more than a handful of cases to be brought in a year.\nPressure by Ann Ming, the mother of 1989 murder victim Julie Hogg\u2014whose killer, Billy Dunlop, was initially acquitted and subsequently confessed\u2014also contributed to the demand for legal change. On 11 September 2006, Dunlop became the first person to be convicted of murder following a prior acquittal for the same crime, in his case his 1991 acquittal of Hogg's murder. Some years later he had confessed to the crime, and was convicted of perjury, but was unable to be retried for the killing itself. The case was re-investigated in early 2005, when the new law came into effect, and his case was referred to the Court of Appeal, in November 2005, for permission for a new trial, which was granted. Dunlop pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a recommendation he serve no less than 17 years.\nOn 13 December 2010, Mark Weston became the first person to be retried and found guilty of murder by a jury (Dunlop having confessed). In 1996 Weston had been acquitted of the murder of Vikki Thompson at Ascott-under-Wychwood on 12 August 1995, but following the discovery in 2009 of compelling new evidence (Thompson's blood on Weston's boots) he was arrested and tried for a second time. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, to serve a minimum of 13 years.\nIn December 2018, convicted paedophile Russell Bishop was also retried and found guilty by a jury for the Babes in the Wood murders of two 9-year-old girls, Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway, on 9 October 1986. At the original trial in 1987, a key piece of the prosecution's case rested on the recovery of a discarded blue sweatshirt. Under questioning, Bishop denied that the sweatshirt belonged to him, but his girlfriend, Jennifer Johnson, alleged the clothing was Bishop's, before she changed her story in the trial, telling the jury she had never seen the top before. Attributed to a series of blunders in the prosecution's case, Bishop was acquitted by the jury after two hours of deliberations. Three years later, Bishop was found guilty of the abduction, molestation, and attempted murder of a 7-year-old girl in February 1990. In 2014, re-examined by modern forensics, the sweatshirt contained traces of Bishop's DNA, and also had fibres on it from both of the girls' clothing. Tapings taken from Karen Hadaway's arm also yielded traces of Bishop's DNA. At the 2018 trial, a jury of seven men and five women returned a guilty verdict after two-and-a-half hours of deliberation.\nOn 14 November 2019, Michael Weir became the first person to be twice found guilty of a murder. He was originally convicted of the murder of Leonard Harris in 1999, but the conviction was quashed in 2000 by the Court of Appeal on a technicality. In 2018, new DNA evidence had been obtained and palm prints from both murder scenes were matched to Weir. Twenty years after the original conviction, Weir was convicted of the murder for a second time.\nIn February 2020, Merseyside Police called for further reform to the double jeopardy law in England so as to allow previously acquitted suspects to be re-interviewed by police. The force had wanted to re-interview a suspect in the unsolved case of the murders of John Greenwood and Gary Miller who had been acquitted of the crime in 1981, but were not permitted to do so. The force had also not been allowed to re-charge the man of murder in 2019, causing them to publicly request that the law be changed and stating: \"We believe being able to re-question suspects could potentially lead to being able to demonstrate the new and compelling evidence needed to reopen particular cases, including the murders of John Greenwood and Gary Miller\".\nScotland.\nThe double jeopardy rule no longer applies absolutely in Scotland since the Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Act 2011 came into force on 28 November 2011. The Act introduced three broad exceptions to the rule: where the acquittal had been tainted by an attempt to pervert the course of justice; where the accused admitted their guilt after acquittal; and where there was new evidence.\nNorthern Ireland.\nIn Northern Ireland, the Criminal Justice Act 2003, effective 18 April 2005, makes certain \"qualifying offence\" (including murder, rape, kidnapping, specified sexual acts with young children, specified drug offences, defined acts of terrorism, as well as in certain cases attempts or conspiracies to commit the foregoing) subject to retrial after acquittal (including acquittals obtained before passage of the Act) if there is a finding by the Court of Appeal that there is \"new and compelling evidence\".\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, the protection in common law against double jeopardy is maintained through the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which provides:\nConversely, double jeopardy comes with a key exception. Under the dual sovereignty doctrine, multiple sovereigns can indict a defendant for the same crime. The federal and state governments can have overlapping criminal laws, so a criminal offender may be convicted in individual states and federal courts for exactly the same crime or for different crimes arising out of the same facts. However, in 2016, the Supreme Court held in \"Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle\" that Puerto Rico is not a separate sovereign for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The dual sovereignty doctrine has been the subject of substantial scholarly criticism.\nAs described by the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Ball v. United States\" 163 U.S. 662 (1896), one of its earliest cases dealing with double jeopardy, \"the prohibition is not against being twice punished, but against being twice put in jeopardy; and the accused, whether convicted or acquitted, is equally put in jeopardy at the first trial\". The Double Jeopardy Clause encompasses four distinct prohibitions: subsequent prosecution after acquittal, subsequent prosecution after conviction, subsequent prosecution after certain mistrials, and multiple punishment in the same indictment. Jeopardy \"attaches\" when the jury is impanelled, the first witness is sworn, or a plea is accepted.\nProsecution after acquittal.\nWith two exceptions, the government is not permitted to appeal or retry the defendant once jeopardy attaches to a trial unless the case does not conclude. Conditions which constitute \"conclusion\" of a case include\nIn these cases, the trial is concluded and the prosecution is precluded from appealing or retrying the defendant over the offence to which they were acquitted.\nThis principle does not prevent the government from appealing a pre-trial motion to dismiss or other non-merits dismissal, or a directed verdict after a jury conviction, nor does it prevent the trial judge from entertaining a motion for reconsideration of a directed verdict, if the jurisdiction has so provided by rule or statute. Nor does it prevent the government from retrying the defendant after an appellate reversal other than for sufficiency, including \"habeas corpus\", or \"thirteenth juror\" appellate reversals notwithstanding sufficiency on the principle that jeopardy has not \"terminated\".\nThe dual sovereignty doctrine allows a federal prosecution of an offence to proceed regardless of a previous state prosecution for that same offence and vice versa because \"an act denounced as a crime by both national and state sovereignties is an offence against the peace and dignity of both and may be punished by each\". The doctrine is solidly entrenched in the law, but there has been a traditional reluctance in the federal executive branch to gratuitously wield the power it grants, due to public opinion being generally hostile to such action.\nExceptions.\nThere are two exceptions to bans on retrying defendants. If a defendant bribed a judge into acquitting him or her, the defendant was not in jeopardy and can be retried. A member of the armed forces can be retried by court-martial in a military court, even if he or she has been previously acquitted by a civilian court. This exception was used to prosecute Timothy Hennis for the Eastburn family murders after his previous trial acquitted him.\nAn individual can be prosecuted by both the United States and an for the same acts that constituted crimes in both jurisdictions; it was established by the Supreme Court in \"United States v. Lara\" that as the two are separate sovereigns, prosecuting a crime under both tribal and federal law does not attach double jeopardy.\nMultiple punishment, including prosecution after conviction.\nIn \"Blockburger v. United States\" (1932), the Supreme Court announced the following test: the government may separately try and punish the defendant for two crimes if each crime contains an element that the other does not. \"Blockburger\" is the default rule, unless the governing statute legislatively intends to depart; for example, Continuing Criminal Enterprise (CCE) may be punished separately from its predicates, as can conspiracy.\nThe \"Blockburger\" test, originally developed in the multiple punishments context, is also the test for prosecution after conviction. In \"Grady v. Corbin\" (1990), the Court held that a double jeopardy violation could lie even where the \"Blockburger\" test was not satisfied, but \"Grady\" was later distinguished in \"United States v. Felix\" (1992), when the court reverted to the \"Blockburger\" test without completely dismissing the \"Grady\" interpretation. The court eventually overruled \"Grady\" in \"United States v. Dixon\" (1993).\nProsecution after mistrial.\nThe rule for mistrials depends upon who sought the mistrial. If the defendant moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial, unless the prosecutor acted in \"bad faith\", i.e. goaded the defendant into moving for a mistrial because the government specifically wanted a mistrial. If the prosecutor moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial if the trial judge finds \"manifest necessity\" for granting the mistrial. The same standard governs mistrials granted sua sponte.\nRetrials are not common, due to the legal expenses to the government. However, in the mid-1980s Georgia antique dealer James Arthur Williams was tried a record four times for murder over the shooting of Danny Hansford, and after three mistrials was finally acquitted on the grounds of self-defence. The case is recounted in the book \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,\" which was adapted into a film directed by Clint Eastwood (the movie combines the four trials into one).\nExternal links.\nUnited Kingdom.\nResearch and Notes produced for the UK Parliament, summarising the history of legal change, views and responses, and analyses:"}
{"id": "7942", "revid": "31320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7942", "title": "Disbarment", "text": "Disbarment, also known as striking off, is the removal of a lawyer from a bar association or the practice of law, thus revoking their law license or admission to practice law. Disbarment is usually a punishment for unethical or criminal conduct but may also be imposed for incompetence or incapacity. Procedures vary depending on the law society; temporary disbarment may be called suspension.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, states regulate the Legal Profession under state law despite many participating in a uniform scheme. Admission as a lawyer is the business of the admissions board and the Supreme Court. Disciplinary proceedings may be commenced by the Bar Association, the Law Society of which one is a member, or the board itself.\nGermany.\nIn Germany, a \"Berufsverbot\" is a ban on practicing a profession, which the government can issue to a lawyer for misconduct, \"Volksverhetzung\" or for serious mismanagement of personal finances.\nIn April 1933, the Nazi government issued a \"Berufsverbot\" forbidding the practice of law by Jews, Communists, and other political opponents, except for those protected by the \"Frontk\u00e4mpferprivileg\".\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, the removal of the licence to practise of a barrister or Scottish advocate is called being \"disbarred\", whilst the removal of a solicitor from the rolls in England and Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland is called being \"struck off\".\nUnited States.\nOverview.\nGenerally, disbarment is imposed as a sanction for conduct indicating that an attorney is not fit to practice law, willfully disregarding a client's interests, commingling funds, or engaging in fraud that impedes the administration of justice. In some states, any lawyer who is convicted of a felony is automatically suspended pending further disciplinary proceedings, or, in New York, automatically disbarred. Automatic disbarment, although opposed by the American Bar Association, has been described as a convicted felon's just deserts.\nIn the United States legal system, disbarment is specific to regions; one can be disbarred from some courts while still being a member of the bar in another jurisdiction. However, under the American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct, which have been adopted in most states, disbarment in one state or court is grounds for disbarment in a jurisdiction which has adopted the Model Rules.\nDisbarment is quite rare: in 2011, only 1,046 lawyers were disbarred. Instead, lawyers are usually sanctioned by their clients through civil malpractice proceedings, or via fine, censure, suspension, or other punishments from the disciplinary boards. To be disbarred is considered a great embarrassment and shame, even if one no longer wishes to continue a career in law.\nBecause disbarment rules vary by area, different rules can apply depending on where a lawyer is disbarred. Notably, most US states have no procedure for permanently disbarring a person. Depending on the jurisdiction, a lawyer may reapply to the bar immediately, after five to seven years, or be banned for life.\nNotable U.S. disbarments.\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, one former U.S. president and one former U.S. vice president have been disbarred, and another former president has been suspended from one bar and forced to resign from another bar rather than face disbarment.\nFormer vice president Spiro Agnew, having pleaded no contest (which subjects a person to the same criminal penalties as a guilty plea but is not an admission of guilt for a civil suit) to charges of bribery and tax evasion, was disbarred from Maryland, the state of which he had previously been governor.\nFormer president Richard Nixon was disbarred from New York in 1976 for obstruction of justice related to the Watergate scandal. He had attempted to resign from the New York bar, as he had done with California and the Supreme Court, but his resignation was not accepted as he would not acknowledge that he was unable to defend himself from the charges brought against him.\nIn 2001, following a 5-year suspension by the Arkansas bar, the United States Supreme Court suspended Bill Clinton from the United States Supreme Court bar, providing 40 days for him to contest disbarment. He resigned before the end of the 40 days, thus avoiding disbarment.\nAlger Hiss was disbarred for a felony conviction but later became the first person reinstated to the bar in Massachusetts after disbarment.\nIn 2007, Mike Nifong, the District Attorney of Durham County, North Carolina who presided over the 2006 Duke University lacrosse case, was disbarred for prosecutorial misconduct related to his handling of the case.\nIn April 2012, a three-member panel appointed by the Arizona Supreme Court voted unanimously to disbar Andrew Thomas, former County Attorney of Maricopa County, Arizona, and a former close confederate of Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. According to the panel, Thomas \"outrageously exploited power, flagrantly fostered fear, and disgracefully misused the law\" while serving as Maricopa County Attorney. The panel found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that Thomas brought unfounded and malicious criminal and civil charges against political opponents, including four state judges and the state attorney general. \"Were this a criminal case,\" the panel concluded, \"we are confident that the evidence would establish this conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\nJack Thompson, the Florida lawyer noted for his activism against Howard Stern, video games, and rap music, was permanently disbarred for various charges of misconduct. The action resulted from several grievances claiming that Thompson had made defamatory, false statements and attempted to humiliate, embarrass, harass, or intimidate his opponents. The order was made on September 25, 2008, effective October 25. However, Thompson tried to appeal to the higher courts to avoid the penalty taking effect. Neither the US District Court nor the US Supreme Court would hear his appeal, rendering the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court final.\nEd Fagan, a New York lawyer who prominently represented Holocaust victims against Swiss banks, was disbarred in New York (in 2008) and New Jersey (in 2009) for failing to pay court fines and fees; and for misappropriating client and escrow trust funds.\nF. Lee Bailey, noted criminal defense attorney, was disbarred by Florida in 2001, with reciprocal disbarment in Massachusetts in 2002. The Florida disbarment resulted from his stock handling in the DuBoc marijuana case. Bailey was found guilty of 7 counts of attorney misconduct by the Florida Supreme Court. Bailey had transferred a large portion of DuBoc's assets into his own accounts, using the interest gained on those assets to pay for personal expenses. In March 2005, Bailey filed to regain his law license in Massachusetts. The book \"Florida Pulp Nonfiction\" details the peculiar facts of the DuBoc case and extended interviews with Bailey, including his own defense. Bailey is also best known for representing murder suspect O. J. Simpson in 1994.\nRichard P. Liebowitz, a New York attorney focused on copyrights held by photographers, was disbarred by the state of New York in 2024 following suspension from the practice of law in the Southern District of New York. His disbarment followed what was described as a \"pattern and practice of failing to comply with court orders and making false statements to the court\" and multiple lawsuits wherein Liebowitz was sanctioned for misconduct.\nRudy Giuliani was disbarred in New York and Washington, D.C., for false allegations about mass voter fraud and his participation in the January 6, 2021, attack on the United States Capitol to subvert the 2020 Presidential Election."}

{"id": "7946", "revid": "1269313988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7946", "title": "Dog tag", "text": "Dog tag is an informal but common term for a specific type of identification tag worn by military personnel. The tags' primary use is for the identification of casualties; they have information about the individual written on them, including identification and essential basic medical information such as blood type and history of inoculations. They often indicate a religious preference as well.\nDog tags are usually fabricated from a corrosion-resistant metal. They commonly contain two copies of the information, either in the form of a single tag that can be broken in half, or as two identical tags on the same chain. This purposeful duplication allows one tag, or half-tag, to be collected from an individual's dead body for notification, while the duplicate remains with the corpse if the conditions of battle prevent it from being immediately recovered. The term arose and became popular because of the tags' resemblance to animal registration tags. Although typically worn around the neck, Dog tags have been worn on boot laces and wristbands etc.\nHistory.\nThe earliest mention of an identification tag for soldiers comes in Polyaenus (Stratagems 1.17) where the Spartans wrote their names on sticks tied to their left wrists. A type of dog tag (\"signaculum\") was given to the Roman legionary at the moment of enrollment. The legionary \"signaculum\" was a lead disk with a leather string, worn around the neck, with the name of the recruit and the indication of the legion of which the recruit was part. This procedure, together with enrollment in the list of recruits, was made at the beginning of a four-month probatory period (\"probatio\"). The recruit obtained the military status only after the oath of allegiance (\"sacramentum\") at the end of \"probatio\", meaning that from a legal point of view the \"signaculum\" was given to a subject who was no longer a civilian, but not yet in the military.\nIn more recent times, dog tags were provided to Chinese soldiers as early as the mid-19th century. During the Taiping revolt (1851\u201366), both the Imperialists (i.e., the Chinese Imperial Army regular servicemen) and those Taiping rebels wearing a uniform wore wooden dog tags at the belt, bearing the soldier's name, age, birthplace, unit, and date of enlistment.\nAmerican Civil War.\nDuring the American Civil War from 1861 to 1865, some soldiers pinned paper notes with their name and home address to the backs of their coats. Other soldiers stenciled identification on their knapsacks or scratched it in the soft lead backing of their army belt buckles.\nManufacturers of identification badges recognized a market and began advertising in periodicals. Their pins were usually shaped to suggest a branch of service, and engraved with the soldier's name and unit. Machine-stamped tags were also made of brass or lead with a hole and usually had (on one side) an eagle or shield, and such phrases as \"War for the Union\" or \"Liberty, Union, and Equality\". The other side had the soldier's name and unit, and sometimes a list of battles in which he had participated.\nFranco-Prussian War.\nOn a volunteer basis Prussian soldiers had decided to wear identification tags in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. However, many rejected dog tags as a bad omen for their lives. So until eight months after the Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz, with almost 8,900 Prussian casualties, only 429 of them could be identified. With the formation of the North German Confederation in 1867 Prussian military regulations became binding for the militaries of all North German member states. With the Prussian \"Instruktion \u00fcber das Sanit\u00e4tswesen der Armee im Felde\" (i.e., instruction on the medical corps organisation of the army afield) issued on 29 April 1869 identification tags (then called \"Erkennungsmarke\"; literally \"recognition mark\") were to be handed out to each soldier before deployment afield. The Prussian Army issued identification tags for its troops at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. They were nicknamed \"Hundemarken\" (the German equivalent of \"dog tags\") and compared to a similar identification system instituted by the dog licence fee, adding tags to collars of those dogs whose owners paid the fee, in the Prussian capital city of Berlin at around the same time period.\nWorld War I.\nThe British Army introduced identity discs in place of identity cards in 1907, in the form of aluminium discs, typically made at regimental depots using machines similar to those common at fun fairs, the details being pressed into the thin metal one letter at a time.\nArmy Order 287 of September 1916 required the British Army provide all soldiers with two official tags, both made of vulcanised asbestos fibre (which were more comfortable to wear in hot climates) carrying identical details, again impressed one character at a time. The first tag, an octagonal green disc, was attached to a long cord around the neck. The second tag, a circular red disc, was threaded on a 6-inch cord suspended from the first tag. The first tag was intended to remain on the body for future identification, while the second tag could be taken to record the death.\nBritish and Empire/Commonwealth forces (Australia, Canada, and New Zealand) were issued essentially identical identification discs of basic pattern during the Great War, Second World War and Korea, though official identity discs were frequently supplemented by private-purchase items such as identity bracelets, particularly favoured by sailors who believed the official discs were unlikely to survive long immersion in water.\nThe U.S. Army first authorized identification tags in War Department General Order No. 204, dated December 20, 1906, which essentially prescribes the Kennedy identification tag:\nThe U.S. Army changed regulations on July 6, 1916, so that all soldiers were issued two tags: one to stay with the body and the other to go to the person in charge of the burial for record-keeping purposes. In 1918, the U.S. Army adopted and allotted the service number system, and name and service numbers were ordered stamped on the identification tags.\nWorld War II \"notched\" tags.\nThere is a recurring myth about the notch situated in one end of the dog tags issued to United States Army personnel during World War II, and up until the Korean War era. It was rumored that the notch's purpose was that, if a soldier found one of his comrades on the battlefield, he could take one tag to the commanding officer and stick the other between the teeth of the soldier to ensure that the tag would remain with the body and be identified.\nIn reality, the notch was used with the Model 70 Addressograph Hand Identification Imprinting Machine (a pistol-type imprinter used primarily by the Medical Department during World War II). American dogtags of the 1930s through 1980s were produced using a Graphotype machine, in which characters are debossed into metal plates. Some tags are still debossed, using earlier equipment, and some are embossed (with raised letters) on computer-controlled equipment.\nIn the Graphotype process, commonly used commercially from the early 1900s through the 1980s, a debossing machine was used to stamp characters into metal plates; the plates could then be used to repetitively stamp such things as addresses onto paper in the same way that a typewriter functions, except that a single stroke of the printer could produce a block of text, rather than requiring each character to be printed individually. The debossing process creates durable, easily legible metal plates, well-suited for military identification tags, leading to adoption of the system by the American military. It was also realized that debossed tags can function the same way the original Graphotype plates do.\nThe Model 70 took advantage of this fact, and was intended to rapidly print all of the information from a soldier's dogtag directly onto medical and personnel forms, with a single squeeze of the trigger. However, this requires that the tag being inserted with the proper orientation (stamped characters facing down), and it was believed that battlefield stress could lead to errors. To force proper orientation of the tags, the tags are produced with a notch, and there is a locator tab inside the Model 70 which prevents the printer from operating if the tag is inserted with the notch in the wrong place (as it is if the tag is upside down).\nThis feature was not as useful in the field as had been hoped, however, due to adverse conditions such as weather, dirt and dust, water, etc. In addition, the Model 70 resembled a pistol, thus attracting the attention of snipers (who might assume that a man carrying a pistol was an officer). As a result, use of the Model 70 hand imprinter by field medics was rapidly abandoned (as were most of the Model 70s themselves), and eventually the specification that tags include the locator notch was removed from production orders. Existing stocks of tags were used until depleted, and in the 1960s it was not uncommon for a soldier to be issued one tag with the notch and one tag without. Notched tags are still in production, to satisfy the needs of hobbyists, film production, etc., while the Model 70 imprinter has become a rare collector's item.\nIt appears instructions that would confirm the notch's mythical use were issued at least unofficially by the Graves Registration Service during the Vietnam War to Army troops headed overseas.\nDog tags are traditionally part of the makeshift battlefield memorials soldiers created for their fallen comrades. The casualty's rifle with bayonet affixed is stood vertically atop the empty boots, with the helmet over the rifle's stock. The dog tags hang from the rifle's handle or trigger guard.\nNon-military usage.\nMedical condition identification.\nSome tags (along with similar items such as MedicAlert bracelets) are used also by civilians to identify their wearers and:\nMilitary personnel in some jurisdiction may wear a supplementary medical information tag.\nFashion.\nDog tags have found their way into youth fashion as military chic. Originally worn as a part of a military uniform by youth wishing to present a tough or militaresque image, dog tags have since reached wider fashion circles. They may be inscribed with a person's details, beliefs or tastes, a favorite quote, or may bear the name or logo of a band or performer. The wearing of dog tags as a fashion accessory can be considered disrespectful by some military personnel.\nSince the late 1990s, custom dog tags have been fashionable amongst musicians (particularly rappers), and as a marketing give-away item. Numerous companies offer customers the opportunity to create their own personalized dog tags with their own photos, logos, and text. High-end jewellers have featured gold and silver dog tags encrusted with diamonds and other jewels.\nAfter the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, in which over 250 hostages were kidnapped from Israel to the Gaza Strip, dog tags became a symbol of the movement to free the Israeli hostages. It became common for people in Israel and elsewhere to publicly wear their own military dog tags or specially made dog tags to show solidarity with the hostages and their families, and to symbolize a call for the immediate release or rescue of the hostages. Phrases inscribed on the purpose-made dog tags include \"bring them home now,\" \"7.10.23,\" and \"\u05d4\u05dc\u05d1 \u05e9\u05dc\u05e0\u05d5 \u05e9\u05d1\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d6\u05d4\" (English: \"our hearts are captive in Gaza\"). These inscribed dog tags are sold in markets and online shops, often as part of fundraisers to benefit the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, or other similar causes.\nVariations by country.\nAustria.\nThe Austrian \"Bundesheer\" used a single long, rectangular tag, with oval ends, stamped with blood group &amp; Rh factor at the end, with ID number underneath. Two slots and a hole stamped beneath allows the tag to be broken in halves, and the long bottom portion has both the ID number and a series of holes which allows the tag to be inserted into a dosimeter. This has been replaced with a more conventional, wider and rounded rectangle which can still be halved, but lacks the dosimeter reading holes.\nAustralia.\nThe Australian Defence Force issues soldiers two tags of different shapes, one octagonal and one circular, containing the following information:\nThe information is printed exactly the same on both discs. In the event of a casualty, the circular tag is removed from the body.\nBelgium.\nBelgian Forces identity tags are, like the Canadian and Norwegian, designed to be broken in two in case of fatality; the lower half is returned to the Belgian Defence staff, while the upper half remains on the body. The tags contain the following information:\nCanada.\nCanadian Forces identity discs (abbreviated \"ID discs\") are designed to be broken in two in the case of fatality; the lower half is returned to National Defence Headquarters with the member's personal documents, while the upper half remains on the body. The tags contain the following information:\nBefore the Service Number was introduced in the 1990s, military personnel were identified on the ID discs (as well as other documents) by their social insurance number.\nChina.\nThe People's Liberation Army issues two long, rectangular tags. All information is stamped in Simplified Chinese:\nPLA is introducing a two-dimensional matrix code on the second tag, the matrix code contains a link to the official database. This allows the inquirer get more details about the military personnel.\nColombia.\nThe Ej\u00e9rcito Nacional de Colombia uses long, rectangular metal tags with oval ends tags stamped with the following information:\nDuplicate tags are issued. Often, tags are issued with a prayer inscribed on the reverse.\nCyprus.\nIn Cyprus, identification tags include the following information:\nDenmark.\nThe military of Denmark use dog tags made from small, rectangular metal plates. The tag is designed to be broken into two pieces each with the following information stamped onto it:\nAdditionally, the right hand side of each half-tag is engraved .\nStarting in 1985, the individual's service number (which is the same as the social security number) is included on the tag. In case the individual dies, the lower half-tag is supposed to be collected, while the other will remain with the corpse. In the army, navy, and air force but not in the national guard, the individual's blood type is indicated on the lower half-tag only, since this information becomes irrelevant if the individual dies. In 2009, Danish dog tags were discontinued for conscripts.\nEast Germany.\nThe \"Nationale Volksarmee\" used a tag nearly identical to that used by both the Wehrmacht and the West German Bundeswehr. The oval aluminum tag was stamped \"DDR\" (Deutsche Demokratische Republik) above the personal ID number; this information was repeated on the bottom half, which was intended to be broken off in case of death. Oddly, the tag was not worn (but would have been in case of war), but required to be kept in a plastic sleeve in the back of the WDA (\"Wehrdienstausweis\") identity booklet.\nEcuador.\nThe \"Placas de identificaci\u00f3n de campa\u00f1a\" consists of two long, rectangular steel or aluminum tags with rounded corners and a single hole punched in one end. It is suspended by a US-type ball chain, with a shorter chain for the second tag. The information on the tag is:\nEstonia.\nEstonian dog tags are designed to be broken in two. The dog tag is a metallic rounded rectangle suspended by a ball chain. Information consists of four fields:\nExample: \nFinland.\nIn the Finnish Defence Forces, \"\"tunnuslevy\" or WWII term \"tuntolevy\"\" (Finnish for \"Identification plate\") is made of stainless steel and designed to be broken in two; however, the only text on it is the personal identification number and the letters \"FI\" or \"SF\" in older models, which stands for Suomi Finland, within a tower stamped atop of the upper half.\nFrance.\nIn WWI and WWII, French forces used a small oval-shaped disc of metal designed to be broken in half, worn at the wrist.\nNow, France issues either a metallic rounded rectangle (army) or a pair of disc (air force, navy), \ndesigned to be broken in half, bearing family name &amp; first name above the ID number.\nFrench army tags also include blood type,\"T\" for Tetanus vaccine and \"OFF\" only for officers.\nPicture show last model, \"plaque d'identit\u00e9 mod\u00e8le 1995\".\nGermany.\nSee above for former \"East Germany\".\nGerman Bundeswehr ID tags are an oval-shaped disc designed to be broken in half. They are made of stainless steel, height and width. The two sides contain different information which are mirrored upside-down on the lower half of the ID tag. They feature the following information on segmented and numbered fields:\nOn the front:\nOn the back:\n\"Bundesamt f\u00fcr Wehrtechnik und Beschaffung\" of 2009-12-21 specifies shape, materials and characteristics for four parts:\nThe ID tag is landscape-oval, breakable in two halves with 4\u20138 manual bends. On the backside each half is 0.2\u00a0mm deep marked with \"DEU\" for \"Deutschland\", the non-magnetic type on both halves and both sides with \"NM\".\nThe metal sheet is 0.7\u00a0mm thick, material codes X5CrNi1810 or 1.4301, weighs about 16 g. NM-variant shall consist of 1.4311 or 1.4401. Sharp edges have to be smoothed, then the plate electropolished. Mechanical deburring and ball polishing is allowed.\nThe letters stamped in for the person must stay readable after a glow test for 10 minutes in air at 1200\u00a0\u00b0C.\nThe ball chain is of X5CrNi1810, diameter of ball is 3.5\u00a0mm, that of the wire 1.5\u00a0mm. Closure is of 1.4301, stainless steel, too. The long chain is 680 + 30\u00a0mm long, the short one 145 + 7\u00a0mm. Breaking force of the chain including the closure must reach 100 N, after 10 min glow at 1200\u00a0\u00b0C in air at least 10 N.\nGreece.\nIn Greece, identification tags include the following information:\nHungary.\nThe Hungarian army dog tag is made out of steel, forming a 25\u00d735\u00a0mm tag designed to split diagonally. Both sides contain the same information: the soldier's personal identity code, blood group and the word HUNGARIA. Some may not have the blood group on them. These are only issued to soldiers who are serving outside of the country. If the soldier should die, one side is removed and kept for the army's official records, while the other side is left attached to the body.\nIraq.\nThe Saddam-era Iraqi Army used a single, long, rectangular metal tag with oval ends, inscribed (usually by hand) with Name and Number or Unit, and occasionally Blood Type.\nIsrael.\nDog tags of the Israel Defense Forces are designed to be broken in two. The information appears in three lines (twice):\nRecruits are issued with 2 Dogtags (4 halves total), one remains whole and worn on a necklace, and the second is broken into its halves and placed in each military boot for the purpose of Identifying dead soldiers (IDF Military Boots contain pouches on their inner sides at the 1/3 calf height, the pouches have holes corresponding in size and placement to those on the discs, allowing for fastening, often via small cable ties).\nOriginally the IDF issued two circular aluminum tags (1948 \u2013 late 1950s) stamped in three lines with serial number, family name, and first name. The tags were threaded together through a single hole onto a cord worn around the neck.\nItaly.\nRectangular piece, 35x45 mm, designed to be broken in two. Includes soldier's first and last name, coded date and place of birth, identification number, religious affiliation, and blood group.\nJapan.\nJapan follows a similar system to the US Army for its Japan Self-Defense Forces personnel, and the appearance of the tags is similar, although laser etched. The exact information order is as follows.\nMalaysia.\nMalaysian Armed Forces have two identical oval tags with this information:\nIf more information needed, another two oval wrist tags are provided. The term \"wrist tags\" can be used to refer to the bracelet-like wristwatch. The additional tags only need to be worn on the wrist, with the main tags still on the neck. All personnel are allowed to attach a small religious pendant or locket; this makes a quick identifiable reference for their funeral services.\nMexico.\nThe Mexican Army uses two long identity tags, very similar to the ones used in the United States Army. They are rectangular metal tags with oval ends, embossed with name, serial number, and blood type, plus Rh factor.\nNetherlands.\nDutch military identity tags, like the Canadian and Norwegian ones, are designed to be broken in two in case of a fatality; the lower end is returned to Dutch Defence Headquarters, while the upper half remains on the body.\nThe tags contain the following information:\nThere is a difference in the Army and Air Force service number and the Navy service number:\nNorway.\nNorwegian dog tags are designed to be broken in two like the Canadian and the Dutch version:\nPoland.\nThe first dog tags were issued in Poland following the order of the General Staff of December 12, 1920. The earliest design (dubbed \"kapala\" in Polish, more properly called \"kapsel legitymacyjny\" \u2013 meaning \"identification cap\") consisted of a tin-made 30\u00d750\u00a0mm rectangular frame and a rectangular cap fitting into the frame. Soldiers' details were filled in a small ID card placed inside the frame, as well as on the inside of the frame itself. The dog tag was similar to the tags used by the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. In case the soldier died, the frame was left with his body, while the lid was returned to his unit together with a note on his death. The ID card was handed over to the chaplain or the rabbi.\nIn 1928, a new type of dog tag was proposed by gen. bryg. , Poland's representative at the International Red Cross. It was slightly modified and adopted in 1931 under the name of Nie\u015bmiertelnik wz. 1931 (lit. \"Immortalizer, pattern 1931\"). The new design consisted of an oval piece of metal (ideally steel, but in most cases aluminum alloy was used), roughly 40 by 50 millimeters. There were two rectangular holes in the middle to allow for easier breaking of the into halves. The halves contained the same set of data \u2013 name, religion, place of birth, year of birth \u2013 and were identical, except the upper half had two holes for a string or twine to go through, and the lower had one hole.\nThe 2008 pattern (wz. 2008) specifies two Stadium-shaped 0.8mm-thick 51\u00d727mm tags with a 3mm hole, made of heat-resistant steel, engraved with:\nparallel to the long axis, and the name of Polish Army \"Si\u0142y Zbrojne RP\" and the Polish coat of arms on the rounded end opposite the hole.\nThe 2024 pattern (wz. 2024) returns to a single 40\u00d750mm ellipsis with 2+1 holes, of stainless steel, 1mm thick, laser-engraved, indented across the short axis with two rectangular holes to break apart, with each half containing\nand\non the obverse. The halves are flipped with respect to each other, such that when unbroken, both sides contain all information.\nRhodesia.\nThe former Republic of Rhodesia used two WW2 British-style compressed asbestos fiber tags, a No. 1 octagonal (grey) tag and a No. 2 circular (red) tag, stamped with identical information. The red tag was supposedly fireproof and the grey tag rotproof. The following information was stamped on the tags: Number, Name, Initials, &amp; Religion; Blood Type was stamped on reverse. The air force and BSAP often stamped their service on the reverse side above the blood group.\nRussia.\nThe Russian Armed Forces use oval metal tags, similar to the dog tags of the Soviet Army. Each tag contains the title and the individual's alphanumeric number, as shown on the photo.\nSingapore.\nThe Singapore Armed Forces-issued dog tags are inscribed (not embossed) with up to four items:\nThe dog tags consist of two metal pieces, one oval with two holes and one round with one hole. A synthetic lanyard is threaded through both holes in the oval piece and tied around the wearer's neck. The round piece is tied to the main loop on a shorter loop.\nSouth Africa.\nThe South African National Defence Force use two long, rectangular stainless steel tags with oval ends, stamped with :\nSouth Korea.\nThe South Korean army issues two long, rectangular tags with oval ends, stamped (in Korean lettering). The tags are worn on the neck with a ball chain. The tags contain the information listed below:\nSouth Vietnam.\nThe South Vietnamese Army and the South Vietnamese Navy used two American-style dog tags. Some tags added religion on the back, e.g., Ph\u1eadt Gi\u00e1o for Buddhist. They were stamped or inscribed with: \nSoviet Union.\nDuring World War II, the Red Army did not issue metal dog tags to its troops. They were issued small black Bakelite cylinders containing a slip of paper with a soldier's particulars written on it. These do not hold up as well as metal dog tags.\nAfter World War II, the Soviet Army used oval metal tags, similar to today's dog tags of the Russian Armed forces. Each tag contains the title and the individual's alphanumeric number.\nSpain.\nIssues a single metal oval, worn vertically, stamped \"\" above and below the 3-slot horizontal break line. It is stamped in 4 lines with:\nSweden.\nSwedish identification tags are designed to be able to break apart. The information on them was prior to 2010 and are as follows:\nSwedish dog tags issued to Armed Forces personnel after 2010 are, for personal security reasons, only marked with a personal identity number.\nDuring the Cold War, dog tags were issued to everyone, often soon after birth, since the threat of total war also meant the risk of severe civilian casualties. However, in 2010, the Government decided that the dog tags were not needed anymore.\nSwitzerland.\nSwiss Armed Forces ID tag is an oval shaped non reflective plaque, containing the following information:\nOn the back side the letters CH (standing for \"Confoederatio Helvetica\") are engraved next to a Swiss cross.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe British Armed Forces currently use two circular non-reflecting stainless steel tags, referred to as \"ID Disks\", engraved with the following 'Big 5' details:\nThe discs are suspended from one long chain (24 inches long) and one short chain (4.5 inches long)\nDuring World War One and Two, service personnel were issued pressed fibre identity disks, one green octagonal shaped disc, and a red round disc (some army units issued a second red round disc to be attached to the service respirator). The identity disks were hand stamped with the surname, initials, service number and religion of the holder and if in the Royal Air Force, the initials RAF. The disks were worn around the neck on a 38\" length of cotton cord, this was often replaced by the wearer with a leather bootlace. One tag was suspended below the main tag.\nThe fibre identity disks in the RAF were still in use in 1999.\nFrom 1960 these were replaced with stainless steel ID tags on a green nylon cord, two circular and one oval. The oval was withdrawn around 1990.\nUnited States.\nTags are properly known as identification tags; the term \"dog tags\" has never been used in regulations.\nThe U.S. Armed Forces typically carry two identical oval dog tags containing:\nReligious designation.\nDuring World War II, an American dog tag could indicate only one of three religions through the inclusion of one letter: \"P\" for Protestant, \"C\" for Catholic, or \"H\" for Jewish (from the word \"Hebrew\"), or (according to at least one source) \"NO\" to indicate no religious preference. Army regulations (606\u20135) soon included X and Y in addition to P, C, and H: the X indicating any religion not included in the first three, and the Y indicating either no religion or a choice not to list religion.\nBy the time of the Vietnam War, some IDs spelled out the broad religious choices such as PROTESTANT and CATHOLIC, rather than using initials, and also began to show individual denominations such as \"METHODIST\" or \"BAPTIST\". Tags did vary by service, however, such as the use of \"CATH\" instead of \"CATHOLIC\" on some Navy tags. For those with no religious affiliation and those who chose not to list an affiliation, either the space for religion was left blank or the words \"NO PREFERENCE\" or \"NO RELIGIOUS PREF\" (or the abbreviation \"NO PREF\") were included.\nAlthough American dog tags currently include the recipient's religion as a way of ensuring that religious needs will be met, some personnel have them reissued without religious affiliation listed\u2014or keep two sets, one with the designation and one without\u2014out of fear that identification as a member of a particular religion could increase the danger to their welfare or their lives if they fell into enemy hands. Some Jewish personnel avoided flying over German lines during WWII with ID tags that indicated their religion, and some Jewish personnel avoid the religious designation today out of concern that they could be captured by extremists who are anti-Semitic. Additionally, when American troops were first sent to Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War there were allegations that some U.S. military authorities were pressuring Jewish military personnel to avoid listing their religions on their ID tags."}

{"id": "7950", "revid": "43682176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7950", "title": "Drum", "text": "The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments. In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone. Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a percussion mallet, to produce sound. There is usually a resonant head on the underside of the drum. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years.\nDrums may be played individually, with the player using a single drum, and some drums such as the djembe are almost always played in this way. Others are normally played in a set of two or more, all played by one player, such as bongo drums and timpani. A number of different drums together with cymbals form the basic modern drum kit.\nUses.\nDrums are usually played by striking with the hand, a beater attached to a pedal, or with one or two sticks with or without padding. A wide variety of sticks are used, including wooden sticks and sticks with soft beaters of felt on the end. In jazz, some drummers use brushes for a smoother, quieter sound. In many traditional cultures, drums have a symbolic function and are used in religious ceremonies. Drums are often used in music therapy, especially hand drums, because of their tactile nature and easy use by a wide variety of people. In the 2000s, drums have also been used as a way to engage in aerobic exercise and is called cardio drumming.\nIn popular music and jazz, \"drums\" usually refers to a drum kit or a set of drums (with some cymbals, or in the case of harder rock music genres, many cymbals), and \"drummer\" to the person who plays them.\nDrums acquired even divine status in places such as Burundi, where the \"karyenda\" was a symbol of the power of the king.\nConstruction.\nThe shell almost always has a circular opening over which the drumhead is stretched, but the shape of the remainder of the shell varies widely. In the Western musical tradition, the most usual shape is a cylinder, although timpani, for example, use bowl-shaped shells. Other shapes include a frame design (tar, Bodhr\u00e1n), truncated cones (bongo drums, Ashiko), goblet shaped (djembe), and joined truncated cones (talking drum).\nA drum contains cylindrical shells can be open at one end (as is the case with timbales), or can have two drum heads, one head on each end. Single-headed drums typically consist of a skin stretched over an enclosed space, or over one of the ends of a hollow vessel. Drums with two heads covering both ends of a cylindrical shell often have a small hole somewhat halfway between the two heads; the shell forms a resonating chamber for the resulting sound. Exceptions include the African slit drum, also known as a log drum as it is made from a hollowed-out tree trunk, and the Caribbean steel drum, made from a metal barrel. Drums with two heads can also have a set of wires, called snares, held across the bottom head, top head, or both heads, hence the name snare drum. On some drums with two heads, a hole or bass reflex port may be cut or installed onto one head, as with some 2010s era bass drums in rock music.\nOn modern band and orchestral drums, the drumhead is placed over the opening of the drum, which in turn is held onto the shell by a \"counterhoop\" (or \"rim\"), which is then held by means of a number of tuning screws called \"tension rods\" that screw into lugs placed evenly around the circumference. The head's tension can be adjusted by loosening or tightening the rods. Many such drums have six to ten tension rods. The sound of a drum depends on many variables\u2014including shape, shell size and thickness, shell materials, counterhoop material, drumhead material, drumhead tension, drum position, location, and striking velocity and angle.\nPrior to the invention of tension rods, drum skins were attached and tuned by rope systems\u2014as on the Djembe\u2014or pegs and ropes such as on Ewe drums. These methods are rarely used today, though sometimes appear on regimental marching band snare drums. The head of a talking drum, for example, can be temporarily tightened by squeezing the ropes that connect the top and bottom heads. Similarly, the tabla is tuned by hammering a disc held in place around the drum by ropes stretching from the top to bottom head. Orchestral timpani can be quickly tuned to precise pitches by using a foot pedal.\nSounds.\nSeveral factors determine the sound a drum produces, including the type, shape and construction of the drum shell, the type of drum heads it has, and the tension of these drumheads. Different drum sounds have different uses in music. For example, the modern Tom-tom drum. A jazz drummer may want drums that are high pitched, resonant and quiet whereas a rock drummer may prefer drums that are loud, dry and low-pitched.\nThe drum head has the most effect on how a drum sounds. Each type of drum head serves its own musical purpose and has its own unique sound. Double-ply drumheads dampen high frequency harmonics because they are heavier and they are suited to heavy playing. Drum heads with a white, textured coating on them muffle the overtones of the drum head slightly, producing a less diverse pitch. Drum heads with central silver or black dots tend to muffle the overtones even more, while drum heads with perimeter sound rings mostly eliminate overtones. Some jazz drummers avoid using thick drum heads, preferring single ply drum heads or drum heads with no muffling. Rock drummers often prefer the thicker or coated drum heads.\nThe second biggest factor that affects drum sound is head tension against the shell. When the hoop is placed around the drum head and shell and tightened down with tension rods, the tension of the head can be adjusted. When the tension is increased, the amplitude of the sound is reduced and the frequency is increased, making the pitch higher and the volume lower.\nThe type of shell also affects the sound of a drum. Because the vibrations resonate in the shell of the drum, the shell can be used to increase the volume and to manipulate the type of sound produced. The larger the diameter of the shell, the lower the pitch. The larger the depth of the drum, the louder the volume. Shell thickness also determines the volume of drums. Thicker shells produce louder drums. Mahogany raises the frequency of low pitches and keeps higher frequencies at about the same speed. When choosing a set of shells, a jazz drummer may want smaller maple shells, while a rock drummer may want larger birch shells.\nHistory.\nDrums made with alligator skins have been found in Neolithic cultures located in China, dating to a period of 5500\u20132350 BC. In literary records, drums manifested shamanistic characteristics and were often used in ritual ceremonies.\nThe bronze Dong Son drum was fabricated by the Bronze Age Dong Son culture of northern Vietnam. They include the ornate Ngoc Lu drum.\nAnimal drumming.\nMacaque monkeys drum objects in a rhythmic way to show social dominance and this has been shown to be processed in a similar way in their brains to vocalizations, suggesting an evolutionary origin to drumming as part of social communication. Other primates including gorillas make drumming sounds by chest beating or hand clapping, and rodents such as kangaroo rats also make similar sounds using their paws on the ground.\nTalking drums.\nDrums are used not only for their musical qualities, but also as a means of communication over great distances. The talking drums of Africa are used to imitate the tone patterns of spoken language. Throughout Sri Lankan history drums have been used for communication between the state and the community, and Sri Lankan drums have a history stretching back over 2500 years.\nDrums in art.\nDrumming may be a purposeful expression of emotion for entertainment, spiritualism and communication. Many cultures practice drumming as a spiritual or religious passage and interpret drummed rhythm similarly to spoken language or prayer. Drumming has developed over millennia to be a powerful art form. Drumming is commonly viewed as the root of music and is sometimes performed as a kinesthetic dance. As a discipline, drumming concentrates on training the body to punctuate, convey and interpret musical rhythmic intention to an audience and to the performer.\nMilitary uses.\nChinese troops used t\u00e0ig\u01d4 drums to motivate troops, to help set a marching pace, and to call out orders or announcements. For example, during a war between Qi and Lu in 684 BC, the effect of drum on soldiers' morale is employed to change the result of a major battle. Fife-and-drum corps of Swiss mercenary foot soldiers also used drums. They used an early version of the snare drum carried over the player's right shoulder, suspended by a strap (typically played with one hand using traditional grip). It is to this instrument that the English word \"drum\" was first used. Similarly, during the English Civil War rope-tension drums would be carried by junior officers as a means to relay commands from senior officers over the noise of battle. These were also hung over the shoulder of the drummer and typically played with two drum sticks. Different regiments and companies would have distinctive and unique drum beats only they recognized. In the mid-19th century, the Scottish military started incorporating pipe bands into their Highland regiments.\nDuring pre-Columbian warfare, Aztec nations were known to have used drums to send signals to the battling warriors. The Nahuatl word for drum is roughly translated as \"huehuetl\".\nThe Rig Veda, one of the oldest religious scriptures in the world, contains several references to the use of the \"Dundhubi\" (war drum). Arya tribes charged into battle to the beating of the war drum and chanting of a hymn that appears in Book VI of the Rig Veda and also the Atharva Veda. The dundhuhi was considered sacred and to capture one in battle would signal defeat of the enemy."}

The ancient Greeks considered the centre of the world to be in Delphi, marked by the stone monument known as the Omphalos of Delphi (navel).\nAccording to the Suda, Delphi took its name from the Delphyne, the she-serpent (\"drakaina\") who lived there and was killed by the god Apollo (in other accounts the serpent was the male serpent (\"drakon\") Python).\nThe sacred precinct occupies a delineated region on the south-western slope of Mount Parnassus.\nIt is now an extensive archaeological site, and since 1938 a part of Parnassos National Park. The precinct is recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in having had a great influence in the ancient world, as evidenced by the various monuments built there by most of the important ancient Greek city-states, demonstrating their fundamental Hellenic unity.\nAdjacent to the sacred precinct is a small modern town of the same name.\nNames.\nDelphi shares the same root with the Greek word for womb, \u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03cd\u03c2 \"delphys\".\nPytho (\u03a0\u03c5\u03b8\u03ce) is related to Pythia, the priestess serving as the oracle, and to Python, a serpent or dragon who lived at the site. \"Python\" is derived from the verb \u03c0\u03cd\u03b8\u03c9 (\"pyth\u014d\"), \"to rot\".\nDelphi and the Delphic region.\nToday Delphi is a municipality of Greece as well as a modern town adjacent to the ancient precinct. The modern town was created after removing buildings from the sacred precinct so that the latter could be excavated. The two Delphis, old and new, are located on Greek National Road 48 between Amfissa in the west and Livadeia, capital of Voiotia, in the east. The road follows the northern slope of a pass between Mount Parnassus on the north and the mountains of the Desfina Peninsula on the south. The pass is of the river Pleistos, running from east to west, forming a natural boundary across the north of the Desfina Peninsula, and providing an easy route across it.\nOn the west side the valley joins the north\u2013south valley between Amfissa and Itea.\nOn the north side of the valley junction a spur of Parnassus looming over the valley made narrower by it is the site of ancient Krisa, which once was the ruling power of the entire valley system. Both Amphissa and Krissa are mentioned in the \"Iliad's\" Catalogue of Ships. It was a Mycenaean stronghold. Archaeological dates of the valley go back to the Early Helladic. Krisa itself is Middle Helladic. These early dates are comparable to the earliest dates at Delphi, suggesting Delphi was appropriated and transformed by Phocians from ancient Krisa. It is believed that the ruins of Kirra, now part of the port of Itea, were the port of Krisa of the same name.\nArchaeology of the precinct.\nThe site was first briefly excavated in 1880 by Bernard Haussoullier (1852\u20131926) on behalf of the French School at Athens, of which he was a sometime member. The site was then occupied by the village of Kastri, about 100 houses, 200 people. Kastri (\"fort\") had been there since the destruction of the place by Theodosius I in 390. He probably left a fort to make sure it was not repopulated, however, the fort became the new village. They were mining the stone for re-use in their own buildings. British and French travelers visiting the site suspected it was ancient Delphi. Before a systematic excavation of the site could be undertaken, the village had to be relocated, but the residents resisted.\nThe opportunity to relocate the village occurred when it was substantially damaged by an earthquake, with villagers offered a completely new village in exchange for the old site. In 1893, the French Archaeological School removed vast quantities of soil from numerous landslides to reveal both the major buildings and structures of the sanctuary of Apollo and of the temple to Athena, the Athena Pronoia along with thousands of objects, inscriptions, and sculptures.\nDuring the Great Excavation architectural members from a fifth-century Christian basilica, were discovered that date to when Delphi was a bishopric. Other important Late Roman buildings are the Eastern Baths, the house with the peristyle, the Roman Agora, and the large cistern. At the outskirts of the city late Roman cemeteries were located.\nTo the southeast of the precinct of Apollo lay the so-called Southeastern Mansion, a building with a 65-meter-long fa\u00e7ade, spread over four levels, with four triclinia and private baths. Large storage jars kept the provisions, whereas other pottery vessels and luxury items were discovered in the rooms. Among the finds stands out a tiny leopard made of mother of pearl, possibly of Sassanian origin, on display in the ground floor gallery of the Delphi Archaeological Museum. The mansion dates to the beginning of the fifth century and functioned as a private house until 580, later however it was transformed into a potter workshop. It is only then, in the beginning of the sixth century, that the city seems to decline: its size is reduced and its trade contacts seem to be drastically diminished. Local pottery production is produced in large quantities: it is coarser and made of reddish clay, aiming at satisfying the needs of the inhabitants.\nThe Sacred Way remained the main street of the settlement, transformed, however, into a street with commercial and industrial use. Around the agora were built workshops as well as the only intra muros early Christian basilica. The domestic area spread mainly in the western part of the settlement. The houses were rather spacious and two large cisterns provided running water to them.\nDelphi Archaeological Museum.\nThe museum houses artifacts associated with ancient Delphi, including the earliest known notation of a melody, the Charioteer of Delphi, Kleobis and Biton, golden treasures discovered beneath the Sacred Way, the Sphinx of Naxos, and fragments of reliefs from the Siphnian Treasury. Immediately adjacent to the exit is the inscription that mentions the Roman proconsul Gallio.\nArchitecture of the precinct.\nMost of the ruins that survive today date from the most intense period of activity at the site in the sixth century BC.\nTemple of Apollo.\nAncient tradition refers to a succession of mythical temples on the site: first one built of olive branches from Tempe, then one built of beeswax and wings by bees, and thirdly one built by Hephaestus and Athena. The first archaeologically attested structure was built in the seventh century BC and is attributed in legend to the architects Trophonios and Agamedes. It burnt down in 548/7\u00a0BC and the Alcmaeonids built a new structure which itself burnt down in the fourth century BC.\nThe ruins of the Temple of Apollo that are visible today date from the fourth century\u00a0BC, and are of a peripteral Doric building. It was erected by Spintharus, Xenodoros, and Agathon.\nTreasuries.\nFrom the entrance of the upper site, continuing up the slope on the Sacred Way almost to the Temple of Apollo, are a large number of votive statues, and numerous so-called treasuries. These were built by many of the Greek city-states to commemorate victories and to thank the oracle for her advice, which was thought to have contributed to those victories. These buildings held the offerings made to Apollo; these were frequently a \"tithe\" or tenth of the spoils of a battle. The most impressive is the now-restored Athenian Treasury, built to commemorate their victory at the Battle of Marathon in 490\u00a0BC.\nThe Siphnian Treasury was dedicated by the city of Siphnos, whose citizens gave a tithe of the yield from their silver mines until the mines came to an abrupt end when the sea flooded the workings.\nOne of the largest of the treasuries was that of Argos. Having built it in the late classical period, the Argives took great pride in establishing their place at Delphi amongst the other city-states. Completed in 380 BC, their treasury seems to draw inspiration mostly from the Temple of Hera located in the Argolis. However, recent analysis of the Archaic elements of the treasury suggest that its founding preceded this.\nOther identifiable treasuries are those of the Sicyonians, the Boeotians, Massaliots, and the Thebans.\nAltar of the Chians.\nLocated in front of the Temple of Apollo, the main altar of the sanctuary was paid for and built by the people of Chios. It is dated to the fifth century BC by the inscription on its cornice. Made entirely of black marble, except for the base and cornice, the altar would have made a striking impression. It was restored in 1920.\nStoa of the Athenians.\nThe stoa, or open-sided, covered porch, is placed in an approximately east\u2013west alignment along the base of the polygonal wall retaining the terrace on which the Temple of Apollo sits. There is no archaeological suggestion of a connection to the temple. The stoa opened to the Sacred Way. The nearby presence of the Treasury of the Athenians suggests that this quarter of Delphi was used for Athenian business or politics, as stoas are generally found in market-places.\nAlthough the architecture at Delphi is generally Doric, a plain style, in keeping with the Phocian traditions that were Doric, the Athenians did not prefer the Doric. The stoa was built in their own preferred style, the Ionic order, the capitals of the columns being a sure indicator. In the Ionic order they are floral and ornate, although not so much as the Corinthian, which is in deficit there. The remaining porch structure contains seven fluted columns, unusually carved from single pieces of stone (most columns were constructed from a series of discs joined). The inscription on the stylobate indicates that it was built by the Athenians after their naval victory over the Persians in 478\u00a0BC, to house their war trophies. At that time the Athenians and the Spartans were on the same side.\nThe Sibyl rock is a pulpit-like outcrop of rock between the Athenian Treasury and the Stoa of the Athenians upon the Sacred Way that leads up to the temple of Apollo in the archaeological area of Delphi. The rock is claimed to be the location from which a prehistoric Sibyl pre-dating the Pythia of Apollo sat to deliver her prophecies. Other suggestions are that the Pythia might have stood there, or an acolyte whose function was to deliver the final prophecy. The rock seems ideal for public speaking.\nTheatre.\nThe ancient theatre at Delphi was built farther up the hill from the Temple of Apollo giving spectators a view of the entire sanctuary and the valley below. It was originally built in the fourth\u00a0century\u00a0BC, but was remodeled on several occasions, particularly in 160/159 B.C. at the expenses of king Eumenes II of Pergamon and, in 67 A.D., on the occasion of emperor Nero's visit.\nThe koilon (cavea) leans against the natural slope of the mountain whereas its eastern part overrides a little torrent that led the water of the fountain Cassotis right underneath the temple of Apollo. The orchestra was initially a full circle with a diameter measuring seven meters. The rectangular scene building ended up in two arched openings, of which the foundations are preserved today. Access to the theatre was possible through the parodoi, i.e. the side corridors. On the support walls of the parodoi are engraved large numbers of manumission inscriptions recording fictitious sales of the slaves to the deity. The koilon was divided horizontally in two zones via a corridor called diazoma. The lower zone had 27 rows of seats and the upper one only eight. Six radially arranged stairs divided the lower part of the koilon in seven tiers. The theatre could accommodate approximately 4,500 spectators.\nOn the occasion of Nero's visit to Greece in 67 A.D. various alterations took place. The orchestra was paved and delimited by a parapet made of stone. The proscenium was replaced by a low pedestal, the pulpitum; its fa\u00e7ade was decorated in relief with scenes from myths about Hercules. Further repairs and transformations took place in the second century A.D. Pausanias mentions that these were carried out under the auspices of Herod Atticus. In antiquity, the theatre was used for the vocal and musical contests that formed part of the programme of the Pythian Games in the late Hellenistic and Roman period. The theatre was abandoned when the sanctuary declined in Late Antiquity. After its excavation and initial restoration it hosted theatrical performances during the Delphic Festivals organized by A. Sikelianos and his wife, Eva Palmer, in 1927 and in 1930. It has recently been restored again as the serious landslides posed a grave threat for its stability for decades.\nTholos.\nThe tholos at the sanctuary of Athena Pronaea (\u1f08\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u1fb6 \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03b1, \"Athena of forethought\") is a circular building that was constructed between 380 and 360\u00a0BC. It consisted of 20 Doric columns arranged with an exterior diameter of 14.76\u00a0meters, with 10 Corinthian columns in the interior.\nThe Tholos is located approximately a half a mile (800 m) from the main ruins at Delphi (at ). Three of the Doric columns have been restored, making it the most popular site at Delphi for tourists to take photographs.\nThe architect of the \"vaulted temple at Delphi\" is named by Vitruvius, in \"De architectura\" Book VII, as Theodorus Phoceus (not Theodorus of Samos, whom Vitruvius names separately).\nGymnasium.\nThe gymnasium, which is half a mile away from the main sanctuary, was a series of buildings used by the youth of Delphi. The building consisted of two levels: a stoa on the upper level providing open space, and a palaestra, pool, and baths on lower floor. These pools and baths were said to have magical powers, and imparted the ability to communicate directly to Apollo.\nStadium.\nThe stadium is located farther up the hill, beyond the \"via sacra\" and the theatre. It was built in the fifth century\u00a0BC, but was altered in later centuries. The last major remodelling took place in the second century\u00a0AD under the patronage of Herodes Atticus when the stone seating was built and an (arched) entrance created. It could seat 6500 spectators and the track was 177\u00a0metres long and 25.5\u00a0metres wide.\nHippodrome.\nIt was at the Pythian Games that prominent political leaders, such as Cleisthenes, tyrant of Sikyon, and Hieron, tyrant of Syracuse, competed with their chariots. The hippodrome where these events took place was referred to by Pindar, and this monument was sought by archaeologists for over two centuries.\nTraces of it have recently been found at Gonia in the plain of Krisa in the place where the original stadium had been sited.\nPolygonal wall.\nA retaining wall was built to support the terrace housing the construction of the second temple of Apollo in 548\u00a0BC. Its name is taken from the polygonal masonry of which it is constructed. At a later date, from 200\u00a0BC onwards, the stones were inscribed with the manumission (liberation) contracts of slaves who were consecrated to Apollo. Approximately a thousand manumissions are recorded on the wall.\nCastalian spring.\nThe sacred spring of Delphi lies in the ravine of the Phaedriades. The preserved remains of two monumental fountains that received the water from the spring date to the Archaic period and the Roman, with the latter cut into the rock.\nRoman Agora.\nThe first set of remains that the visitor sees upon entering the archaeological site of Delphi is the Roman Agora, which was just outside the \"peribolos\", or precinct walls, of the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi. The Roman Agora was built between the sanctuary and the Castalian Spring, approximately 500 meters away. This large rectangular paved square used to be surrounded by Ionic porticos on its three sides. The square was built in the Roman period, but the remains visible at present along the north and northwestern sides date to the Late Antique period.\nAn open market was probably established, where the visitors would buy ex-votos, such as statuettes and small tripods, to leave as offerings to the gods. It also served as an assembly area for processions during sacred festivals.\nDuring the empire, statues of the emperor and other notable benefactors were erected here as evidenced by the remaining pedestals. In late, Antiquity workshops of artisans were also created within the agora.\nAthletic statues.\nDelphi is famous for its many preserved athletic statues. It is known that Olympia originally housed far more of these statues, but time brought ruin to many of them, leaving Delphi as the main site of athletic statues. Kleobis and Biton, two brothers renowned for their strength, are modeled in two of the earliest known athletic statues at Delphi. The statues commemorate their feat of pulling their mother's cart several miles to the Sanctuary of Hera in the absence of oxen. The neighbors were most impressed and their mother asked Hera to grant them the greatest gift. When they entered Hera's temple, they fell into a slumber and never woke, dying at the height of their admiration, the perfect gift.\nThe Charioteer of Delphi is another ancient relic that has withstood the centuries. It is one of the best known statues from antiquity. The charioteer has lost many features, including his chariot and his left arm, but he stands as a tribute to athletic art of antiquity.\nMyths regarding the origin of the precinct.\nIn the \"Iliad\", Achilles would not accept Agamemnon's peace offering even if it included all the wealth in the \"stone floor\" of \"rocky Pytho\" (I 404). In the \"Odyssey\" (\u03b8 79) Agamemnon crosses a \"stone floor\" to receive a prophecy from Apollo in Pytho, the first known of proto-history. Hesiod also refers to Pytho \"in the hollows of Parnassus\" (Theogony 498). These references imply that the earliest date of the oracle's existence is the eighth century BC, the probable date of composition of the Homeric works.\nThe main myths of Delphi are given in three literary \"loci\". H. W. Parke, the Delphi scholar, argued that the myths are self-contradictory, thereby aligning with the Plutarchian epistemology that these myths are not to be taken as literal historical accounts but as symbolic narratives meant to explain oracular traditions.\" Parke asserts that there is no Apollo, no Zeus, no Hera, and certainly never was a great, serpent-like monster, and that the myths are pure Plutarchian figures of speech, meant to be aetiologies of some oracular tradition.\nHomeric Hymn 3, \"To Apollo\", is the oldest of the three loci, dating to the seventh century BC (estimate). Apollo travels about after his birth on Delos seeking a place for an oracle. He is advised by Telephus to choose Crissa \"below the glade of Parnassus\", which he does, and has a temple built. Killing the serpent that guards the spring. Subsequently, some Cretans from Knossos sail up on a mission to reconnoitre Pylos. Changing into a dolphin, Apollo casts himself on deck. The Cretans do not dare to remove him but sail on. Apollo guides the ship around Greece, ending back at Crisa, where the ship grounds. Apollo enters his shrine with the Cretans to be its priests, worshipping him as \"Delphineus\", \"of the dolphin\".\nZeus, a Classical deity, reportedly determined the site of Delphi when he sought to find the centre of his \"Grandmother Earth\" (Gaia). He sent two eagles flying from the eastern and western extremities, and the path of the eagles crossed over Delphi where the omphalos, or navel of Gaia was found.\nAccording to Aeschylus in the prologue of the \"Eumenides\", the oracle had origins in prehistoric times and the worship of Gaia, a view echoed by H. W. Parke, who described the evolution of beliefs associated with the site. He established that the prehistoric foundation of the oracle is described by three early writers: the author of the \"Homeric Hymn to Apollo\", Aeschylus in the prologue to the \"Eumenides\", and Euripides in a chorus in the \"Iphigeneia in Tauris\". Parke goes on to say, \"This version [Euripides] evidently reproduces in a sophisticated form the primitive tradition which Aeschylus for his own purposes had been at pains to contradict: the belief that Apollo came to Delphi as an invader and appropriated for himself a previously existing oracle of Earth. The slaying of the serpent is the act of conquest which secures his possession; not as in the \"Homeric Hymn\", a merely secondary work of improvement on the site. Another difference is also noticeable. The \"Homeric Hymn\", as we saw, implied that the method of prophecy used there was similar to that of Dodona: both Aeschylus and Euripides, writing in the fifth century, attribute to primeval times the same methods as used at Delphi in their own day. So much is implied by their allusions to tripods and prophetic seats... [he continues on p.\u00a06] ...Another very archaic feature at Delphi also confirms the ancient associations of the place with the Earth goddess. This was the Omphalos, an egg-shaped stone which was situated in the innermost sanctuary of the temple in historic times. Classical legend asserted that it marked the 'navel' (Omphalos) or center of the Earth and explained that this spot was determined by Zeus who had released two eagles to fly from opposite sides of the earth and that they had met exactly over this place\". On p.\u00a07 he writes further, \"So Delphi was originally devoted to the worship of the Earth goddess whom the Greeks called Ge, or Gaia. Themis, who is associated with her in tradition as her daughter and partner or successor, is really another manifestation of the same deity: an identity that Aeschylus recognized in another context. The worship of these two, as one or distinguished, was displaced by the introduction of Apollo. His origin has been the subject of much learned controversy: it is sufficient for our purpose to take him as the \"Homeric Hymn\" represents him \u2013 a northern intruder \u2013 and his arrival must have occurred in the dark interval between Mycenaean and Hellenic times. His conflict with Ge for the possession of the cult site was represented under the legend of his slaying the serpent.\nOne tale of the sanctuary's discovery states that a goatherd, who grazed his flocks on Parnassus, one day observed his goats playing with great agility upon nearing a chasm in the rock; the goatherd noticing this held his head over the chasm causing the fumes to go to his brain; throwing him into a strange trance.\nThe Homeric Hymn to Delphic Apollo recalled that the ancient name of this site had been \"Krisa\".\nOthers relate that the site was named Pytho (\u03a0\u03c5\u03b8\u03ce) and that Pythia, the priestess serving as the oracle, was chosen from their ranks by the priestesses who officiated at the temple. Apollo was said to have slain Python, a \"drako\" (a male serpent or a dragon) who lived there and protected the navel of the Earth. \"Python\" (derived from the verb \u03c0\u03cd\u03b8\u03c9 (\"pyth\u014d\"), \"to rot\") is claimed by some to be the original name of the site in recognition of Python that Apollo defeated.\nThe name \"Delphi\" comes from the same root as \u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03cd\u03c2 \"delphys\", \"womb\" and may indicate archaic veneration of Gaia at the site. Several other scholars discuss the likely prehistoric beliefs associated with the site.\nApollo is connected with the site by his epithet \u0394\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03af\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \"Delphinios\", \"the Delphinian\". The epithet is connected with dolphins (Greek \u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03af\u03c2,-\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2) in the Homeric \"Hymn to Apollo\" (line 400), recounting the legend of how Apollo first came to Delphi in the shape of a dolphin, carrying Cretan priests on his back. The Homeric name of the oracle is \"Pytho\" (\u03a0\u03c5\u03b8\u03ce). Another legend held that Apollo walked to Delphi from the north and stopped at Tempe, a city in Thessaly, to pick laurel (also known as bay tree) which he considered to be a sacred plant. In commemoration of this legend, the winners at the Pythian Games received a wreath of laurel picked in the temple.\nOracle of Delphi.\nThe prophetic process.\nPerhaps Delphi is best known for its oracle, the Pythia, or sibyl, the priestess prophesying from the tripod in the sunken adyton of the Temple of Apollo. The Pythia was known as a spokesperson for Apollo. She was a woman of blameless life chosen from the peasants of the area. Alone in an enclosed inner sanctum (Ancient Greek \"adyton\" \u2013 \"do not enter\") she sat on a tripod seat over an opening in the earth (the \"chasm\"). According to legend, when Apollo slew Python its body fell into this fissure and fumes arose from its decomposing body. Intoxicated by the vapors, the sibyl would fall into a trance, allowing Apollo to possess her spirit. In this state she prophesied. The oracle could not be consulted during the winter months, for this was traditionally the time when Apollo would live among the Hyperboreans. Dionysus would inhabit the temple during his absence. Of note, release of fumes is limited in colder weather.\nThe time to consult Pythia for an oracle during the year was determined from astronomical and geological grounds related to the constellations of Lyra and Cygnus. Similar practice was followed in other Apollo oracles too.\nHydrocarbon vapors emitted from the chasm. While in a trance the Pythia \"raved\" \u2013 probably a form of ecstatic speech \u2013 and her ravings were \"translated\" by the priests of the temple into elegant hexameters. It has been speculated that the ancient writers, including Plutarch who had worked as a priest at Delphi, were correct in attributing the oracular effects to the sweet-smelling \"pneuma\" (Ancient Greek for breath, wind, or vapor) escaping from the chasm in the rock. That exhalation could have been high in the known anaesthetic and sweet-smelling ethylene or other hydrocarbons such as ethane known to produce violent trances. Although, given the limestone geology, this theory remains debatable, the authors put up a detailed answer to their critics.\nAncient sources describe the priestess using \"laurel\" to inspire her prophecies. Several alternative plant candidates have been suggested including Cannabis, Hyoscyamus, Rhododendron, and Oleander. Harissis claims that a review of contemporary toxicological literature indicates that oleander causes symptoms similar to those shown by the Pythia, and his study of ancient texts shows that oleander was often included under the term \"laurel\". The Pythia may have chewed oleander leaves and inhaled their smoke prior to her oracular pronouncements and sometimes dying from the toxicity. The toxic substances of oleander resulted in symptoms similar to those of epilepsy, the \"sacred disease\", which may have been seen as the possession of the Pythia by the spirit of Apollo.\nInfluence, devastations and a temporary revival.\nThe Delphic oracle exerted considerable influence throughout the Greek world, and she was consulted before all major undertakings including wars and the founding of colonies. She also was respected by the Greek-influenced countries around the periphery of the Greek world, such as Lydia, Caria, and even Egypt.\nThe oracle was also known to the early Romans. Rome's seventh and last king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, after witnessing a snake near his palace, sent a delegation including two of his sons to consult the oracle.\nIn 278 BC, a Thracian (Celtic) tribe raided Delphi, burned the temple, plundered the sanctuary and stole the \"unquenchable fire\" from the altar. During the raid, part of the temple roof collapsed. The same year, the temple was severely damaged by an earthquake, thus it fell into decay and the surrounding area became impoverished. The sparse local population led to difficulties in filling the posts required. The oracle's credibility waned due to doubtful predictions.\nThe oracle flourished again in the second century AD, during the rule of emperor Hadrian, who is believed to have visited the oracle twice and offered complete autonomy to the city. By the 4th century, Delphi had acquired the status of a city.\nConstantine the Great looted several monuments in Eastern Mediterranean, including Delphi, to decorate his new capital, Constantinople. One of those famous items was the bronze column of Plataea (The Serpent Column; Ancient Greek: \u03a4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f4c\u03c6\u03b9\u03c2, Three-headed Serpent; Turkish: Y\u0131lanl\u0131 S\u00fctun, Serpentine Column) from the sanctuary (dated 479 BC), relocated there from Delphi in AD 324, which can still be seen today standing destroyed at a square of Istanbul (where once upon a time was the Hippodrome of Constantinople, built by Constantine; Ottoman Turkish: Atmeydan\u0131 \"Horse Square\") with part of one of its heads kept in the Istanbul Archaeology Museums (\u0130stanbul Arkeoloji M\u00fczeleri).\nDespite the rise of Christianity across the Roman Empire, the oracle remained a religious center throughout the fourth century, and the Pythian Games continued to be held at least until 424 AD; however, the decline continued. The attempt of Emperor Julian to revive polytheism did not survive his reign. Excavations have revealed a large three-aisled basilica in the city, as well as traces of a church building in the sanctuary's gymnasium. The site was abandoned in the sixth or seventh centuries, although a single bishop of Delphi is attested in an episcopal list of the late eighth and early ninth centuries.\nIn modern times, the structured method of communication and forecasting known as the Delphi technique takes its name from the oracle of Delphi, although some founders and early developers of the technique considered that the adoption of the name \"Delphi\" was unfortunate and undesirable.\nReligious significance of the oracle.\nDelphi became the site of a major temple to Phoebus Apollo, as well as the Pythian Games and the prehistoric oracle. Even in Roman times, hundreds of votive statues remained, described by Pliny the Younger and seen by Pausanias. Carved into the temple were three phrases: (\"gn\u014dthi seaut\u00f3n\" = \"know thyself\") and (\"m\u0113d\u00e9n \u00e1gan\" = \"nothing in excess\"), and (\"eng\u00fda p\u00e1ra d'at\u0113\" = \"make a pledge and mischief is nigh\"), In antiquity, the origin of these phrases was attributed to one or more of the Seven Sages of Greece by authors such as Plato and Pausanias. Additionally, according to Plutarch's essay on the meaning of the \"E at Delphi\"\u2014the only literary source for the inscription\u2014there was also inscribed at the temple a large letter E. Among other things epsilon signifies the number 5. However, ancient as well as modern scholars have doubted the legitimacy of such inscriptions. According to one pair of scholars, \"The actual authorship of the three maxims set up on the Delphian temple may be left uncertain. Most likely they were popular proverbs, which tended later to be attributed to particular sages.\"\nAccording to the Homeric hymn to the Pythian Apollo, Apollo shot his first arrow as an infant that effectively slew the serpent Pytho, the son of Gaia, who guarded the spot. To atone the murder of Gaia's son, Apollo was forced to fly and spend eight years in menial service before he could return forgiven. A festival, the Septeria, was held every year, at which the whole story was represented: the slaying of the serpent, and the flight, atonement, and return of the god.\nThe Pythian Games took place every four years to commemorate Apollo's victory. Another regular Delphi festival was the \"Theophania\" (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03c6\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1), an annual festival in spring celebrating the return of Apollo from his winter quarters in Hyperborea. The culmination of the festival was a display of an image of the deities, usually hidden in the sanctuary, to worshippers.\nThe \"theoxenia\" was held each summer, centred on a feast for \"gods and ambassadors from other states\". Myths indicate that Apollo killed the chthonic serpent Python guarding the Castalian Spring and named his priestess Pythia after her. Python, who had been sent by Hera, had attempted to prevent Leto, while she was pregnant with Apollo and Artemis, from giving birth.\nThe spring at the site flowed toward the temple but disappeared beneath, creating a cleft which emitted chemical vapors that purportedly caused the oracle at Delphi to reveal her prophecies. Apollo killed Python, but had to be punished for it, since he was a child of Gaia. The shrine dedicated to Apollo was originally dedicated to Gaia and shared with Poseidon. The name Pythia remained as the title of the Delphic oracle.\nErwin Rohde wrote that the Python was an earth spirit, who was conquered by Apollo, and buried under the omphalos, and that it is a case of one deity setting up a temple on the grave of another. Another view holds that Apollo was a fairly recent addition to the Greek pantheon coming originally from Lydia.\nHistory.\nOccupation of the site at Delphi can be traced back to the Neolithic period with extensive occupation and use beginning in the Mycenaean period (1600\u20131100 BC). In Mycenaean times Krissa was a major Greek land and sea power, perhaps one of the first in Greece, if the Early Helladic date of Kirra is to be believed. The ancient sources indicate that the previous name of the Gulf of Corinth was the \"Krisaean Gulf\". Like Krisa, Corinth was a Dorian state, and Gulf of Corinth was a Dorian lake, so to speak, especially since the migration of Dorians into the Peloponnesus starting about 1000 BC. Krisa's power was broken finally by the recovered Aeolic and Attic-Ionic speaking states of southern Greece over the issue of access to Delphi. Control of it was assumed by the Amphictyonic League, an organization of states with an interest in Delphi, in the early Classical period. Krisa was destroyed for its arrogance. The gulf was given Corinth's name. Corinth by then was similar to the Ionic states: ornate and innovative, not resembling the spartan style of the Doric.\nAncient Delphi.\nEarlier myths include traditions that Pythia, or the Delphic oracle, already was the site of an important oracle in the pre-classical Greek world (as early as 1400\u00a0BC) and, rededicated from about 800\u00a0BC, when it served as the major site during classical times for the worship of the god Apollo.\nDelphi was since ancient times a place of worship for Gaia, the mother goddess connected with fertility. The town started to gain pan-Hellenic relevance as both a shrine and an oracle in the seventh century BC. Initially under the control of Phocaean settlers based in nearby Kirra (currently Itea), Delphi was reclaimed by the Athenians during the First Sacred War (597\u2013585 BC). The conflict resulted in the consolidation of the Amphictyonic League, which had both a military and a religious function revolving around the protection of the Temple of Apollo. This shrine was destroyed by fire in 548 BC and then fell under the control of the Alcmaeonids who were banned from Athens. In 449\u2013448 BC, the Second Sacred War (fought in the wider context of the First Peloponnesian War between the Peloponnesian League led by Sparta and the Delian-Attic League led by Athens) resulted in the Phocians gaining control of Delphi and the management of the Pythian Games.\nIn 356 BC, the Phocians under Philomelos captured and sacked Delphi, leading to the Third Sacred War (356\u2013346 BC), which ended with the defeat of the former and the rise of Macedon under the reign of Philip II. This led to the Fourth Sacred War (339 BC), which culminated in the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC) and the establishment of Macedonian rule over Greece.\nIn Delphi, Macedonian rule was superseded by the Aetolians in 279 BC, when a Gallic invasion was repelled, and by the Romans in 191 BC. The site was sacked by Lucius Cornelius Sulla in 86 BC, during the Mithridatic Wars, and by Nero in 66 AD. Although subsequent Roman emperors of the Flavian dynasty contributed toward to the restoration of the site, it gradually lost importance.\nThe anti-pagan legislation of the late Roman Imperial era deprived ancient sanctuaries of their assets. The emperor Julian attempted to reverse this religious climate, yet his \"pagan revival\" was particularly short-lived. When the doctor Oreibasius visited the oracle of Delphi, in order to question the fate of paganism, he received a pessimistic answer:\nTell the king that the flute has fallen to the ground. Phoebus does not have a home any more, neither an oracular laurel, nor a speaking fountain, because the talking water has dried out\nIt was shut down during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire by Theodosius I in 381 AD.\nAmphictyonic Council.\nThe Amphictyonic Council was a council of representatives from six Greek tribes who controlled Delphi and also the quadrennial Pythian Games. They met biannually and came from Thessaly and central Greece. Over time, the town of Delphi gained more control of itself and the council lost much of its influence.\nThe sacred precinct in the Iron Age.\nExcavation at Delphi, which was a post-Mycenaean settlement of the late ninth\u00a0century, has uncovered artifacts increasing steadily in volume beginning with the last quarter of the eighth century\u00a0BC. Pottery and bronze as well as tripod dedications continue in a steady stream, in contrast to Olympia. Neither the range of objects nor the presence of prestigious dedications proves that Delphi was a focus of attention for a wide range of worshippers, but the large quantity of valuable goods, found in no other mainland sanctuary, encourages that view.\nApollo's sacred precinct in Delphi was a Panhellenic Sanctuary, where every four years, starting in 586\u00a0BC athletes from all over the Greek world competed in the Pythian Games, one of the four Panhellenic Games, precursors of the Modern Olympics. The victors at Delphi were presented with a laurel crown (\"stephanos\") that was ceremonially cut from a tree by a boy who re-enacted the slaying of the Python. (These competitions are also called stephantic games, after the crown.) Delphi was set apart from the other games sites because it hosted the mousikos agon, musical competitions.\nThese Pythian Games rank second among the four stephantic games chronologically and in importance. These games, however, were different from the games at Olympia in that they were not of such vast importance to the city of Delphi as the games at Olympia were to the area surrounding Olympia. Delphi would have been a renowned city regardless of whether it hosted these games; it had other attractions that led to it being labeled the \"omphalos\" (navel) of the earth, in other words, the centre of the world.\nIn the inner \"hestia\" (hearth) of the Temple of Apollo, an eternal flame burned. After the battle of Plataea, the Greek cities extinguished their fires and brought new fire from the hearth of Greece, at Delphi; in the foundation stories of several Greek colonies, the founding colonists were first dedicated at Delphi.\nAbandonment and rediscovery.\nThe Ottomans finalized their domination over Phocis and Delphi in about 1410 AD. Delphi itself remained almost uninhabited for centuries. It seems that one of the first buildings of the early modern era was the monastery of the Dormition of Mary or of Panagia (the Mother of God) built above the ancient gymnasium at Delphi. It must have been toward the end of the fifteenth or in the sixteenth century that a settlement started forming there, which eventually ended up forming the village of Kastri.\nOttoman Delphi gradually began to be investigated. The first Westerner to describe the remains in Delphi was Cyriacus of Ancona, a fifteenth-century merchant turned diplomat and antiquarian, considered the founding father of modern classical archeology. He visited Delphi in March 1436 and remained there for six days. He recorded all the visible archaeological remains based on Pausanias for identification. He described the stadium and the theatre at that date as well as some freestanding pieces of sculpture. He also recorded several inscriptions, most of which are now lost. His identifications, however, were not always correct: for example he described a round building he saw as the temple of Apollo while this was simply the base of the Argives' ex-voto. A severe earthquake in 1500 caused much damage.\nIn 1766, an English expedition funded by the Society of Dilettanti included the Oxford epigraphist Richard Chandler, the architect Nicholas Revett, and the painter William Pars. Their studies were published in 1769 under the title \"Ionian Antiquities\", followed by a collection of inscriptions, and two travel books, one about Asia Minor (1775), and one about Greece (1776). Apart from the antiquities, they also related some vivid descriptions of daily life in Kastri, such as the crude behaviour of the Muslim Albanians who guarded the mountain passes.\nIn 1805 Edward Dodwell visited Delphi, accompanied by the painter Simone Pomardi. Lord Byron visited in 1809, accompanied by his friend John Cam Hobhouse:\nYet there I've wandered by the vaulted rill\nYes! Sighed o'er Delphi's long deserted shrine,\nwhere, save that feeble fountain, all is still.\nHe carved his name on the same column in the gymnasium as Lord Aberdeen, later Prime Minister, who had visited a few years before. Proper excavation did not start until the late nineteenth century (see \"Excavations\" section) after the village had moved.\nDelphi in later art.\nFrom the sixteenth century onward, woodcuts of Delphi began to appear in printed maps and books. The earliest depictions of Delphi were totally imaginary; for example, those created by Nikolaus Gerbel, who published in 1545 a text based on the map of Greece by N. Sofianos. The ancient sanctuary was depicted as a fortified city.\nThe first travelers with archaeological interests, apart from the precursor Cyriacus of Ancona, were the British George Wheler and the French Jacob Spon, who visited Greece in a joint expedition in 1675\u20131676. They published their impressions separately. In Wheler's \"Journey into Greece\", published in 1682, a sketch of the region of Delphi appeared, where the settlement of Kastri and some ruins were depicted. The illustrations in Spon's publication \"Voyage d'Italie, de Dalmatie, de Gr\u00e8ce et du Levant, 1678\" are considered original and groundbreaking.\nTravelers continued to visit Delphi throughout the nineteenth century and published their books which contained diaries, sketches, and views of the site, as well as pictures of coins. The illustrations often reflected the spirit of romanticism, as evident by the works of Otto Magnus von Stackelberg, where, apart from the landscapes (\"La Gr\u00e8ce. Vues pittoresques et topographiques\", Paris 1834) are depicted also human types (\"Costumes et usages des peuples de la Gr\u00e8ce moderne dessin\u00e9s sur les lieux\", Paris 1828). The philhellene painter W. Williams has comprised the landscape of Delphi in his themes (1829). Influential personalities such as F.Ch.-H.-L. Pouqueville, W.M. Leake, Chr. Wordsworth and Lord Byron are amongst the most important visitors of Delphi.\nAfter the foundation of the modern Greek state, the press became also interested in these travelers. Thus \"Ephemeris\" writes (17 March 1889):\nIn the \"Revues des Deux Mondes\" Paul Lefaivre published his memoirs from an excursion to Delphi. The French author relates in a charming style his adventures on the road, praising particularly the ability of an old woman to put back in place the dislocated arm of one of his foreign traveling companions, who had fallen off the horse. \"In Arachova the Greek type is preserved intact. The men are rather athletes than farmers, built for running and wrestling, particularly elegant and slender under their mountain gear.\" Only briefly does he refer to the antiquities of Delphi, but he refers to a pelasgian wall 80\u00a0meters long, \"on which innumerable inscriptions are carved, decrees, conventions, manumissions\".\nGradually the first travelling guides appeared. The revolutionary \"pocket\" books invented by Karl Baedeker, accompanied by maps useful for visiting archaeological sites such as Delphi (1894) and the informed plans, the guides became practical and popular. The photographic lens revolutionized the way of depicting the landscape and the antiquities, particularly from 1893 onward, when the systematic excavations of the French Archaeological School started. However, artists such as Vera Willoughby, continued to be inspired by the landscape.\nDelphic themes inspired several graphic artists. Besides the landscape, Pythia and Sibylla become illustration subjects even on Tarot cards. A famous example constitutes Michelangelo's Delphic Sibyl (1509), the nineteenth-century German engraving, Oracle of Apollo at Delphi, as well as the recent ink on paper drawing, \"The Oracle of Delphi\" (2013) by M. Lind.\nModern artists are inspired also by the Delphic Maxims. Examples of such works are displayed in the \"Sculpture park of the European Cultural Center of Delphi\" and in exhibitions taking place at the Archaeological Museum of Delphi.\nDelphi in later literature.\nDelphi inspired literature as well. In 1814 W. Haygarth, friend of Lord Byron, refers to Delphi in his work \"Greece, a Poem\". In 1888 Charles Marie Ren\u00e9 Leconte de Lisle published his lyric drama L\u2019Apollonide, accompanied by music by Franz Servais. More recent French authors used Delphi as a source of inspiration such as Yves Bonnefoy (Delphes du second jour) or Jean Sullivan (nickname of Joseph Lemarchand) in L'Obsession de Delphes (1967), but also Rob MacGregor's Indiana Jones and the Peril at Delphi (1991).\nThe presence of Delphi in Greek literature is very intense. Poets such as Kostis Palamas (The Delphic Hymn, 1894), Kostas Karyotakis (Delphic festival, 1927), Nikephoros Vrettakos (return from Delphi, 1957), Yannis Ritsos (Delphi, 1961\u201362) and Kiki Dimoula (Gas omphalos and Appropriate terrain 1988), to mention only the most renowned ones. Angelos Sikelianos wrote The Dedication (of the Delphic speech) (1927), the Delphic Hymn (1927) and the tragedy Sibylla (1940), whereas in the context of the Delphic idea and the Delphic festivals he published an essay entitled \"The Delphic union\" (1930). The nobelist George Seferis wrote an essay under the title \"Delphi\", in the book \"Dokimes\"."}
{"id": "7952", "revid": "48323887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7952", "title": "Digital Equipment Corporation", "text": "Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC ), using the trademark Digital, was a major American company in the computer industry from the 1960s to the 1990s. The company was co-founded by Ken Olsen and Harlan Anderson in 1957. Olsen was president until he was forced to resign in 1992, after the company had gone into precipitous decline.\nThe company produced many different product lines over its history. It is best known for the work in the minicomputer market starting in the early 1960s. The company produced a series of machines known as the PDP line, with the PDP-8 and PDP-11 being among the most successful minis in history. Their success was only surpassed by another DEC product, the late-1970s VAX \"supermini\" systems that were designed to replace the PDP-11. Although a number of competitors had successfully competed with Digital through the 1970s, the VAX cemented the company's place as a leading vendor in the computer space. As microcomputers improved in the late 1980s, especially with the introduction of RISC-based workstation machines, the performance niche of the minicomputer was rapidly eroded. \nBy the early 1990s, the company was in turmoil as their mini sales collapsed and their attempts to address this by entering the high-end market with machines like the VAX 9000 were market failures. After several attempts to enter the workstation and file server market, the DEC Alpha product line began to make successful inroads in the mid-1990s, but was too late to save the company. DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry. During the purchase, some parts of DEC were sold to other companies; the compiler business and the Hudson Fab were sold to Intel. At the time, Compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors. DEC was a major player overseas where Compaq had less presence. However, Compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions, and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own. Compaq subsequently merged with Hewlett-Packard (HP) in May 2002.\nHistory.\nOrigins (1944\u20131958).\nKen Olsen and Harlan Anderson were two engineers who had been working at MIT Lincoln Laboratory on the lab's various computer projects. The Lab is best known for their work on what would today be known as \"interactivity\", and their machines were among the first where operators had direct control over programs running in real-time. These had started in 1944 with the famed Whirlwind, which was originally developed to make a flight simulator for the US Navy, although this was never completed. Instead, this effort evolved into the SAGE system for the US Air Force, which used large screens and light guns to allow operators to interact with radar data stored in the computer.\nWhen the Air Force project wound down, the Lab turned their attention to an effort to build a version of the Whirlwind using transistors in place of vacuum tubes. In order to test their new circuitry, they first built a small 18-bit machine known as TX-0, which first ran in 1956. When the TX-0 successfully proved the basic concepts, attention turned to a much larger system, the 36-bit TX-2 with a then-enormous 64 kWords of core memory. Core was so expensive that parts of TX-0's memory were stripped for the TX-2, and what remained of the TX-0 was then given to MIT on permanent loan.\nAt MIT, Ken Olsen and Harlan Anderson noticed something odd: students would line up for hours to get a turn to use the stripped-down TX-0, while largely ignoring a faster IBM machine that was also available. The two decided that the draw of interactive computing was so strong that they felt there was a market for a small machine dedicated to this role, essentially a commercialized TX-0. They could sell this to users where the graphical output or real-time operation would be more important than outright performance. Additionally, as the machine would cost much less than the larger systems then available, it would also be able to serve users that needed a lower-cost solution dedicated to a specific task, where a larger 36-bit machine would not be needed.\nIn 1957, when the pair and Ken's brother Stan sought capital, they found that the American business community was hostile to investing in computer companies. Many smaller computer companies had come and gone in the 1950s, wiped out when new technical developments rendered their platforms obsolete, and even large companies like RCA and General Electric were failing to make a profit in the market. The only serious expression of interest came from Georges Doriot and his American Research and Development Corporation (AR&amp;D). Worried that a new computer company would find it difficult to arrange further financing, Doriot suggested the fledgling company change its business plan to focus less on computers, and even change their name from \"Digital Computer Corporation\".\nThe pair returned with an updated business plan that outlined two phases for the company's development. They would start by selling computer modules as stand-alone devices that could be purchased separately and wired together to produce a number of different digital systems for lab use. Then, if these \"digital modules\" were able to build a self-sustaining business, the company would be free to use them to develop a complete computer in their Phase II. The newly christened \"Digital Equipment Corporation\" received $70,000 from AR&amp;D for a 70% share of the company, and began operations in a Civil War-era textile mill in Maynard, Massachusetts, where plenty of inexpensive manufacturing space was available.\nDigital modules (1958).\nIn early 1958, DEC shipped its first products, the \"Digital Laboratory Module\" line. The Modules consisted of a number of individual electronic components and germanium transistors mounted to a circuit board, the actual circuits being based on those from the TX-2.\nThe Laboratory Modules were packaged in an extruded aluminum housing, intended to sit on an engineer's workbench, although a rack-mount bay was sold that held nine laboratory modules. They were then connected together using banana plug patch cords inserted at the front of the modules. Three versions were offered, running at 5\u00a0MHz (1957), 500\u00a0kHz (1959), or 10\u00a0MHz (1960). The Modules proved to be in high demand by other computer companies, who used them to build equipment to test their own systems. Despite the recession of the late 1950s, the company sold $94,000 worth of these modules during 1958 alone (), turning a profit at the end of its first year.\nThe original Laboratory Modules were soon supplemented with the \"Digital System Module\" line, which were identical internally but packaged differently. The Systems Modules were designed with all of the connections at the back of the module using 22-pin Amphenol connectors, and were attached to each other by plugging them into a backplane that could be mounted in a 19-inch rack. The backplanes allowed 25 modules in a single 5-1/4\u00a0inch section of rack, and allowed the high densities needed to build a computer.\nThe original laboratory and system module lines were offered in 500 kilocycle, 5 megacycle and 10 megacycle versions. In all cases, the supply voltages were -15 and +10 volts, with logic levels of -3 volts (passive pull-down) and 0 volts (active pull-up).\nDEC used the System Modules to build their \"Memory Test\" machine for testing core memory systems, selling about 50 of these pre-packaged units over the next eight years. The PDP-1 and LINC computers were also built using System Modules (see below).\nModules were part of DEC's product line into the 1970s, although they went through several evolutions during this time as technology changed. The same circuits were then packaged as the first \"R\" (red) series \"Flip-Chip\" modules. Later, other Flip-Chip module series provided additional speed, much higher logic density, and industrial I/O capabilities. DEC published extensive data about the modules in free catalogs that became very popular.\nPDP-1 family (1960).\nWith the company established and a successful product on the market, DEC turned its attention to the computer market once again as part of its planned \"Phase II\". In August 1959, Ben Gurley started design of the company's first computer, the PDP-1. In keeping with Doriot's instructions, the name was an initialism for \"Programmable Data Processor\", leaving off the term \"computer\". As Gurley put it, \"We aren't building computers, we're building 'Programmable Data Processors'.\" The prototype was first shown publicly at the Joint Computer Conference in Boston in December 1959. The first PDP-1 was delivered to Bolt, Beranek and Newman in November 1960, and formally accepted the next April. The PDP-1 sold in basic form for $120,000 (). By the time production ended in 1969, 53 PDP-1s had been delivered.\nThe PDP-1 was supplied standard with 4096 words of core memory, 18-bits per word, and ran at a basic speed of 100,000 operations per second. It was constructed using many System Building Blocks that were packaged into several 19-inch racks. The racks were themselves packaged into a single large mainframe case, with a hexagonal control panel containing switches and lights mounted to lie at table-top height at one end of the mainframe. Above the control panel was the system's standard input/output solution, a punched tape reader and writer. Most systems were purchased with two peripherals, the Type 30 vector graphics display, and a Soroban Engineering modified IBM Model B Electric typewriter that was used as a printer. The Soroban system was notoriously unreliable, and often replaced with a modified Friden Flexowriter, which also contained its own punched tape system. A variety of more-expensive add-ons followed, including magnetic tape systems, punched card readers and punches, and faster punched tape and printer systems.\nWhen DEC introduced the PDP-1, they also mentioned larger machines at 24, 30 and 36 bits, based on the same design. During construction of the prototype PDP-1, some design work was carried out on a 24-bit PDP-2, and the 36-bit PDP-3. Although the PDP-2 never proceeded beyond the initial design, the PDP-3 found some interest and was designed in full. Only one PDP-3 appears to have been built, in 1960, by the CIA's Scientific Engineering Institute (SEI) in Waltham, Massachusetts. According to the limited information available, they used it to process radar cross section data for the Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance aircraft. Gordon Bell remembered that it was being used in Oregon some time later, but could not recall who was using it.\nIn November 1962, DEC introduced the $65,000 PDP-4. The PDP-4 was similar to the PDP-1 and used a similar instruction set, but used slower memory and different packaging to lower the price. Like the PDP-1, about 54 PDP-4s were eventually sold, most to a customer base similar to the original PDP-1.\nIn 1964, DEC introduced its new Flip Chip module design, and used it to re-implement the PDP-4 as the PDP-7. The PDP-7 was introduced in December 1964, and about 120 were eventually produced. An upgrade to the Flip Chip led to the R series, which in turn led to the PDP-7A in 1965. The PDP-7 is most famous as the machine for which the Unix operating system was originally written. Unix ran only on DEC systems until the Interdata 8/32.\nA more dramatic upgrade to the PDP-1 series was introduced in August 1966, the PDP-9. The PDP-9 was instruction-compatible with the PDP-4 and \u22127, but ran about twice as fast as the \u22127 and was intended to be used in larger deployments. At only $19,900 in 1968, the PDP-9 was a big seller, eventually selling 445 machines, more than all of the earlier models combined.\nEven while the PDP-9 was being introduced, its replacement was being designed, and was introduced as 1969's PDP-15, which re-implemented the PDP-9 using integrated circuits in place of modules. Much faster than the PDP-9 even in basic form, the PDP-15 also included a floating point unit and a separate input/output processor for further performance gains. Over 400 PDP-15's were ordered in the first eight months of production, and production eventually amounted to 790 examples in 12 basic models. However, by this time other machines in DEC's lineup could fill the same niche at even lower price points, and the PDP-15 would be the last of the 18-bit series.\nPDP-8 family (1962).\nIn 1962, Lincoln Laboratory used a selection of System Building Blocks to implement a small 12-bit machine, and attached it to a variety of analog-to-digital (A to D) input/output (I/O) devices that made it easy to interface with various analog lab equipment. The LINC proved to attract intense interest in the scientific community, and has since been referred to as the first real minicomputer, a machine that was small and inexpensive enough to be dedicated to a single task even in a small lab.\nSeeing the success of the LINC, in 1963 DEC took the basic logic design but stripped away the extensive A to D systems to produce the PDP-5. The new machine, the first outside the PDP-1 mould, was introduced at WESTCON on August 11, 1963. A 1964 ad expressed the main advantage of the PDP-5, \"Now you can own the PDP-5 computer for what a core memory alone used to cost: $27,000\". 116 PDP-5s were produced until the lines were shut down in early 1967. Like the PDP-1 before it, the PDP-5 inspired a series of newer models based on the same basic design that would go on to be more famous than its parent.\nOn March 22, 1965, DEC introduced the PDP-8, which replaced the PDP-5's modules with the new R-series modules using Flip Chips. The machine was re-packaged into a small tabletop case, which remains distinctive for its use of smoked plastic over the CPU which allowed one to easily see the logic modules plugged into the wire-wrapped backplane of the CPU. Sold standard with 4 kWords of 12-bit core memory and a Teletype Model 33 ASR for basic input/output, the machine listed for only $18,000. The PDP-8 is referred to as the first \"real\" minicomputer because of its sub-$25,000 price. Sales were, unsurprisingly, very strong, and helped by the fact that several competitors had just entered the market with machines aimed directly at the PDP-5's market space, which the PDP-8 trounced. This gave the company two years of unrestricted leadership, and eventually 1450 \"straight eight\" machines were produced before it was replaced by newer implementations of the same basic design.\nDEC hit an even lower price-point with the PDP-8/S, the S for \"serial\". As the name implies the /S used a serial arithmetic unit, which was much slower but reduced costs so much that the system sold for under $10,000. DEC then used the new PDP-8 design as the basis for a new LINC, the two-processor LINC-8. The LINC-8 used one PDP-8 CPU and a separate LINC CPU, and included instructions to switch from one to the other. This allowed customers to run their existing LINC programs, or \"upgrade\" to the PDP-8, all in software. Although not a huge seller, 142 LINC-8s were sold starting at $38,500. Like the original LINC to PDP-5 evolution, the LINC-8 was then modified into the single-processor PDP-12, adding another 1000 machines to the 12-bit family. Newer circuitry designs led to the PDP-8/I and PDP-8/L in 1968. In 1975, one year after an agreement between DEC and Intersil, the Intersil 6100 chip was launched, effectively a PDP-8 on a chip. This was a way to allow PDP-8 software to be run even after the official end-of-life announcement for the DEC PDP-8 product line.\nPDP-6 and PDP-10 families (1963 and 1968).\nWhile the PDP-5 introduced a lower-cost line, 1963's PDP-6 was intended to take DEC into the mainframe market with a 36-bit machine. However, the PDP-6 proved to be a \"hard sell\" with customers, as it offered few obvious advantages over similar machines from the better-established vendors like IBM or Honeywell, in spite of its low cost around $300,000. Only 23 were sold, or 26 depending on the source, and unlike other models the low sales meant the PDP-6 was not improved with successor versions. However, the PDP-6 is historically important as the platform that introduced \"Monitor\", an early time-sharing operating system that would evolve into the widely used TOPS-10.\nWhen newer Flip Chip packaging allowed the PDP-6 to be re-implemented at a much lower cost, DEC took the opportunity to refine their 36-bit design, introducing the PDP-10 in 1968. The PDP-10 was as much a success as the PDP-6 was a commercial failure; about 700 mainframe PDP-10s were sold before production ended in 1984. The PDP-10 was widely used in university settings, and thus was the basis of many advances in computing and operating system design during the 1970s. DEC later re-branded all of the models in the 36-bit series as the \"DECsystem-10\", and PDP-10s are generally referred to by the model of their CPU, starting with the \"KA10\", soon upgraded to the \"KI10\" (I:Integrated circuit); then to \"KL10\" (L:Large-scale integration ECL logic); also the \"KS10\" (S: Small form factor). Unified product line upgrades produced the compatible DECSYSTEM-20, along with a TOPS-20 operating system that included virtual memory support.\nThe Jupiter Project was supposed to continue the mainframe product line into the future by using gate arrays with an innovative Air Mover Cooling System, coupled with a built-in floating point processing engine called \"FBOX\". The design was intended for a top tier scientific computing niche, yet the critical performance measurement was based upon COBOL compilation which did not fully utilize the primary design features of Jupiter technology. When the Jupiter Project was cancelled in 1983, some of the engineers adapted aspects of the 36-bit design into a forthcoming 32-bit design, releasing the high-end VAX8600 in 1985.\nPDP-11 (1970).\nDEC's successful entry into the computer market took place during a fundamental shift in the underlying organization of the machines from word lengths based on 6-bit characters to those based on 8-bit words needed to support ASCII. DEC began studies of such a machine, the PDP-X, but Ken Olsen did not support it as he could not see how it offered anything their existing 12-bit or 18-bit machines didn't. This led the leaders of the PDP-X project to leave DEC and start Data General, whose 16-bit Data General Nova was released in 1969 and was a huge success.\nThe success of the Nova finally prompted DEC to take the switch seriously, and they began a crash program to introduce a 16-bit machine of their own. The new system was designed primarily by Harold McFarland, Gordon Bell, Roger Cady, and others. The project was able to leap forward in design with the arrival of Harold McFarland, who had been researching 16-bit designs at Carnegie Mellon University. One of his simpler designs became the basis for the new design, although when they first viewed the proposal, management was not impressed and almost cancelled it.\nThe result was the PDP-11, released in 1970. It differed from earlier designs considerably. In particular, the new design did not include many of the addressing modes that were intended to make programs smaller in memory, a technique that was widely used on other DEC machines and CISC designs in general. This would mean the machine would spend more time accessing memory, which would slow it down. However, the machine also extended the idea of multiple \"General Purpose Registers\" (GPRs), which gave the programmer flexibility to use these high-speed memory caches as they needed, potentially addressing the performance issues.\nA major advance in the PDP-11 design was DEC's Unibus, which supported all peripherals through memory mapping. This allowed a new device to be added easily, generally only requiring plugging a hardware interface board into the backplane and possibly adding a jumper to the wire wrapped backplane, and then installing software that read and wrote to the mapped memory to control it. The relative ease of interfacing spawned a huge market of third party add-ons for the PDP-11, which made the machine even more useful.\nThe combination of architectural innovations proved superior to competitors and the \"11\" architecture was soon the industry leader, propelling DEC back to a strong market position. The design was later expanded to allow paged physical memory and memory protection features, useful for multitasking and time-sharing. Some models supported separate instruction and data spaces for an effective virtual address size of 128\u00a0KB within a physical address size of up to 4\u00a0MB. Smaller PDP-11s, implemented as single-chip CPUs, continued to be produced until 1996, by which time over 600,000 had been sold.\nThe PDP-11 supported several operating systems, including Bell Labs' new Unix operating system as well as DEC's DOS-11, RSX-11, IAS, RT-11, DSM-11, and RSTS/E. Many early PDP-11 applications were developed using standalone paper-tape utilities. DOS-11 was the PDP-11's first disk operating system, but was soon supplanted by more capable systems. RSX provided a general-purpose multitasking environment and supported a wide variety of programming languages. IAS was a time-sharing version of RSX-11D. Both RSTS and Unix were time-sharing systems available to educational institutions at little or no cost, and these PDP-11 systems were destined to be the \"sandbox\" for a rising generation of engineers and computer scientists. Large numbers of PDP-11/70s were deployed in telecommunications and industrial control applications. AT&amp;T Corporation became DEC's largest customer.\nRT-11 provided a practical real-time operating system in minimal memory, allowing the PDP-11 to continue DEC's critical role as a computer supplier for embedded systems. Historically, RT-11 also served as the inspiration for many microcomputer OS's, as these were generally being written by programmers who cut their teeth on one of the many PDP-11 models. For example, CP/M used a command syntax similar to RT-11's, and even retained the awkward PIP program used to copy data from one computer device to another. As another historical footnote, DEC's use of \"/\" for \"switches\" (command-line options) would lead to the adoption of \"\\\" for pathnames in MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows as opposed to \"/\" in Unix.\nThe evolution of the PDP-11 followed earlier systems, eventually including a single-user deskside personal computer form, the MicroPDP-11. In total, around 600,000 PDP-11s of all models were sold, and a wide variety of third-party peripheral vendors had also entered the computer product ecosystem. It was even sold in kit form as the Heathkit H11, although it proved too expensive for Heathkit's traditional hobbyist market.\nVAX (1977).\nThe introduction of semiconductor memory in the early 1970s, and especially dynamic RAM shortly thereafter, led to dramatic reductions in the price of memory as the effects of Moore's Law were felt. Within years, it was common to equip a machine with all the memory it could address, typically 64\u00a0KB on 16-bit machines. This led vendors to introduce new designs with the ability to address more memory, often by extending the address format to 18 or 24-bits in machines were otherwise similar to their earlier 16-bit designs.\nIn contrast, DEC decided to make a more radical departure. In 1976, they began the design of a machine whose entire architecture was expanded from the 16-bit PDP-11 to a new 32-bit basis. This would allow the addressing of very large memories, which were to be controlled by a new virtual memory system, and would also improve performance by processing twice as much data at a time. The system would, however, maintain compatibility with the PDP-11, by operating in a second mode that sent its 16-bit words into the 32-bit internals, while mapping the PDP-11's 16-bit memory space into the larger virtual 32-bit space.\nThe result was the VAX architecture, where VAX stands for Virtual Address eXtension (from 16 to 32 bits). The first computer to use a VAX CPU was the VAX-11/780, announced in October 1977, which DEC referred to as a \"superminicomputer\". Although it was not the first 32-bit minicomputer, the VAX-11/780's combination of features, price, and marketing almost immediately propelled it to a leadership position in the market after it was released in 1978. VAX systems were so successful that in 1983, DEC canceled its Jupiter project, which had been intended to build a successor to the PDP-10 mainframe, and instead focused on promoting the VAX as the single computer architecture for the company.\nSupporting the VAX's success was the VT52, one of the most successful smart terminals. Building on earlier less successful models, the VT05 and VT50, the VT52 was the first terminal that did everything one might want in a single inexpensive chassis. The VT52 was followed by the even more successful VT100 and its follow-ons, making DEC one of the largest terminal vendors in the industry. This was supported by a line of inexpensive computer printers, the DECwriter line. With the VT and DECwriter series, DEC could now offer a complete top-to-bottom system from computer to all peripherals, which formerly required collecting the required devices from different suppliers.\nThe VAX processor architecture and family of systems evolved and expanded through several generations during the 1980s, culminating in the NVAX microprocessor implementation and VAX 7000/10000 series in the early 1990s.\nEarly microcomputers (1982\u20131986).\nWhen a DEC research group demonstrated two prototype microcomputers in 1974\u2014before the debut of the MITS Altair\u2014Olsen chose to not proceed with the project. The company similarly rejected another personal computer proposal in 1977. At the time these systems were of limited utility, and Olsen famously derided them in 1977, stating \"There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.\" Unsurprisingly, DEC did not put much effort into the microcomputer area in the early days of the market. In 1977, the Heathkit H11 was announced; a PDP-11 in kit form. At the beginning of the 1980s, DEC built the VT180 (codenamed \"Robin\"), which was a VT100 terminal with an added Z80-based microcomputer running CP/M, but this product was initially available only to DEC employees.\nIt was only after IBM had successfully launched the IBM PC in 1981 that DEC responded with their own systems. In 1982, DEC introduced not one, but three incompatible machines which were each tied to different proprietary architectures. The first, the DEC Professional, was based on the PDP-11/23 (and later, the 11/73) running the RSX-11M+ derived, but menu-driven, P/OS (\"Professional Operating System\"). This DEC machine easily outperformed the PC, but was more expensive than, and completely incompatible with IBM PC hardware and software, offering far fewer options for customizing a system.\nUnlike CP/M and DOS microcomputers, every copy of every program for the Professional had to be provided with a unique key for the particular machine and CPU for which it was bought. At that time this was mainstream policy, because most computer software was either bought from the company that built the computer or custom-constructed for one client. However, the emerging third-party software industry disregarded the PDP-11/Professional line and concentrated on other microcomputers where distribution was easier. At DEC itself, creating better programs for the Professional was not a priority, perhaps from fear of cannibalizing the PDP-11 line. As a result, the Professional was a superior machine, running inferior software. In addition, a new user would have to learn an awkward, slow, and inflexible menu-based user interface which appeared to be radically different from PC DOS or CP/M, which were more commonly used on the 8080- and 8088-based microcomputers of the time. A second offering, the DECmate II was the latest version of the PDP-8-based word processors, but not really suited to general computing, nor competitive with Wang Laboratories' popular word processing equipment.\nThe most popular early DEC microcomputer was the dual-processor (Z80 and 8088) Rainbow 100, which ran the 8-bit CP/M operating system on the Z80 and the 16-bit CP/M-86 operating system on the Intel 8088 processor. It could also run a UNIX System III implementation called VENIX. Applications from standard CP/M could be re-compiled for the Rainbow, but by this time users were expecting custom-built (pre-compiled binary) applications such as Lotus 1-2-3, which was eventually ported along with MS-DOS 2.0 and introduced in late 1983. Although the Rainbow generated some press, it was unsuccessful due to its high price and lack of marketing and sales support. By late 1983 IBM was outselling DEC's personal computers by more than ten to one.\nA further system was introduced in 1986 as the VAXmate, which included Microsoft Windows 1.0 and used VAX/VMS-based file and print servers along with integration into DEC's own DECnet-family, providing LAN/WAN connection from PC to mainframe or supermini. The VAXmate replaced the Rainbow, and in its standard form was the first widely marketed diskless workstation.\nNetworking and clusters (1984).\nIn 1984, DEC launched its first 10\u00a0Mbit/s Ethernet. Ethernet allowed scalable networking, and VAXcluster allowed scalable computing. Combined with DECnet and Ethernet-based terminal servers (LAT), DEC had produced a networked storage architecture which allowed them to compete directly with IBM. Ethernet replaced Token Ring, and went on to become the dominant networking model in use today.\nIn September 1985, DEC became the fifth company to register a .com domain name (dec.com).\nAlong with the hardware and protocols, DEC also introduced the VAXcluster concept, which allowed several VAX machines to be tied together into a single larger storage system. VAXclusters allowed a DEC-based company to scale their services by adding new machines to the cluster at any time, as opposed to buying a faster machine and using that to replace a slower one. The flexibility this offered was compelling, and allowed DEC to attack high-end markets formerly out of their reach.\nLate 1980s diversification.\nThe PDP-11 and VAX lines continued to sell in record numbers. Better yet, DEC was competing very well against the market leader, IBM, taking an estimated $2\u00a0billion away from them in the mid-1980s. In 1986, DEC's profits rose 38% when the rest of the computer industry experienced a downturn, and by 1987 the company was threatening IBM's number one position in the computer industry. Not long thereafter came IBM's \"VAX killer\" offerings, at a time when DEC had twice the sales of IBM in the mid-range computer market.\nAt its peak, DEC was the second-largest computer company in the world, with over 100,000 employees. It was during this time that the company branched out development into a wide variety of projects that were far from its core business in computer equipment. The company invested heavily in custom software. In the 1970s and earlier most software was custom-written to serve a specific task, but by the 1980s the introduction of relational databases and similar systems allowed powerful software to be built in a modular fashion, potentially saving enormous amounts of development time. Software companies like Oracle became the new darlings of the industry, and DEC started their own efforts in every \"hot\" niche, in some cases several projects for the same niche. Some of these products competed with DEC's own partners, notably Rdb which competed with Oracle's products on the VAX, part of a major partnership only a few years earlier.\nAlthough many of these products were well designed, most of them were DEC-only or DEC-centric, and customers frequently ignored them and used third-party products instead. This problem was further exacerbated by Olsen's aversion to traditional advertising and his belief that well-engineered products would sell themselves. Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on these projects, at the same time that workstations using RISC microprocessors were starting to approach VAX CPUs in performance.\nEarly 1990s faltering and attempted turnaround.\nAs microprocessors continued to improve in the 1980s, it soon became clear that the next generation would offer performance and features equal to the best of DECs low-end minicomputer lineup. Worse, the Berkeley RISC and Stanford MIPS designs were aiming to introduce 32-bit designs that would outperform the fastest members of the VAX family, DEC's cash cow.\nConstrained by the huge success of their VAX and VMS products, which followed the proprietary model, the company was very late to respond to these threats. In the early 1990s, DEC found its sales faltering and its first layoffs followed. The company that created the minicomputer, a dominant networking technology, and arguably the first computers for personal use, had abandoned the \"low end\" market, whose dominance with the PDP-8 had built the company in a previous generation. Decisions about what to do about this threat led to infighting within the company that seriously delayed their responses.\nOne group suggested that every possible development in the industry be poured into the construction of a new VAX family that would leapfrog the performance of the existing machines. This would limit the market erosion in the top-end segment, where profit margins were maximized and DEC could continue to survive as a minicomputer vendor. This line of thought led, eventually, to the VAX 9000 series, which were plagued with problems when they were first introduced in October 1989, already two years late. The problems took so long to work out, and the prices of the systems were so high, that DEC was never able to make the line the success they hoped.\nOthers within the company felt that the proper response was to introduce their own RISC designs and use those to build new machines. However, there was little official support for these efforts, and no less than four separate small projects ran in parallel at various labs around the US. Eventually these were gathered into the PRISM project, which delivered a credible 32-bit design with some unique features allowing it to serve as the basis of a new VAX implementation. Infighting with teams dedicated to DEC's big iron made funding difficult, and the design was not finalized until April 1988, and then cancelled shortly thereafter. The PRISM project was accompanied by the MICA project, which intended to consolidate VMS and ULTRIX into a single operating system.\nAnother group concluded that new workstations like those from Sun Microsystems and Silicon Graphics would take away a large part of DEC's existing customer base before the new VAX systems could address the issues, and that the company needed its own Unix workstation as soon as possible. Fed up with slow progress on both the RISC and VAX fronts, a group in Palo Alto started a skunkworks project to introduce their own systems. Selecting the MIPS processor, which was widely available, introducing the new DECstation series with the model 3100 on January 11, 1989. These systems would see some success in the market, but were later displaced by similar models running the Alpha.\n32-bit MIPS and 64-bit Alpha systems (1992).\nEventually, in 1992, DEC launched the DECchip 21064 processor, the first implementation of their Alpha instruction set architecture, initially named Alpha\u00a0AXP; the \"AXP\" was a \"non-acronym\" and was later dropped. This was a 64-bit RISC architecture as opposed to the 32-bit CISC architecture used in the VAX. It is one of the first \"pure\" 64-bit microprocessor architectures and implementations rather than an extension of an earlier 32-bit architecture. The Alpha offered class-leading performance at its launch and was used in the massively-parallel Cray T3D. Subsequent variants continued that performance trend into the 2000s, along with the Alpha-derived Pentium Pro, II, and III CPUs. An AlphaServer SC45 supercomputer was still ranked No.\u00a06 in the world in November 2004. Alpha-based computers comprising the DEC AXP series, later the AlphaStation, and AlphaServer series respectively superseded both the VAX and MIPS architecture in DEC's product lines. They supported OpenVMS, DEC OSF/1 AXP (later known as Digital Unix or Tru64 UNIX) and Microsoft's then-new operating system, Windows NT, an operating system made possible by ex-Digital Equipment Corporation engineers.\nIn 1998, following the takeover by Compaq Computer Corporation, a decision was made that Microsoft would no longer support and develop Windows NT for the Alpha series computers, a decision that was seen as the beginning of the end for the Alpha series computers.\nStrongARM (1995).\nIn the mid-1990s, Digital Semiconductor collaborated with ARM Limited to produce the StrongARM microprocessor. This was based in part on ARM7 and in part on DEC technologies like Alpha, and was targeted at embedded systems and portable devices. It was highly compatible with the ARMv4 architecture and was very successful, competing effectively against rivals such as the SuperH and MIPS architectures in the portable digital assistant market. Microsoft subsequently dropped support for these other architectures in their Pocket PC platform. In 1997, as part of a lawsuit settlement, the StrongARM intellectual property was sold to Intel. They continued to produce StrongARM, as well as developing it into the XScale architecture. Intel subsequently sold this business to Marvell Technology Group in 2006.\nPalmer's reign (1992\u20131998).\nAt its peak in the late 1980s, DEC had $14 billion in sales and ranked among the most profitable companies in the US. With its strong staff of engineers, DEC was expected to usher in the age of personal computers, but the commonly misunderstood belief then argued by the board to its shareholders was that Mr. Olsen was openly skeptical of the desktop machines, stating \"the personal computer will fall flat on its face in business\", and regarding them as \"toys\" used for playing video games. This was made in 1977 about what could be more characterised as home automation devices.\nThe board forced Olsen to resign as president in July 1992 after two years of losses in operating income. He was replaced by Robert Palmer as the company's president. DEC's board of directors also granted Palmer the title of chief executive officer (\"CEO\"), a title that had never been used during DEC's 35-year existence. Palmer had joined DEC in 1985 to run Semiconductor Engineering and Manufacturing. His relentless campaign to be CEO, and success with the Alpha microprocessor family, made him a candidate to succeed Olsen. At the same time a more modern logo was designed\nPalmer restructured DEC into nine business units that reported directly to him. Nonetheless, DEC continued to suffer record losses, including a loss of $260.5 million for the quarter that ended on September 30, 1992. It reported $2.8 billion in losses for its fiscal year 1992. January 5, 1993, saw the retirement of John F. Smith as senior vice president of operations, the second in command at DEC, and his position was not filled. A 35-year company veteran, he had joined DEC in 1958 as the company's 12th employee, passing up a chance to work for Bell Laboratories in New Jersey to work for DEC. Smith rose to become one of the three senior vice presidents in 1987 and was widely considered among the potential successors to Ken Olsen, especially when Smith was appointed chief operating officer in 1991. Smith became a corporate spokesman on financial issues, and had filled in at trouble spots for which Olsen ordered more attention. Smith was passed over in favor of Palmer when Olsen was forced to resign in July 1992, though Smith stayed on for a time to help turn around the struggling company.\nIn June 1993, Palmer and several of his top lieutenants presented their reorganization plans to applause from the board of directors, and several weeks later DEC reported its first profitable quarter in several years. However, on April 15, 1994, DEC reported a loss of $183 million\u2014three to four times higher than the loss many people on Wall Street had predicted (compared with a loss of $30 million in the comparable period a year earlier), causing the stock price on the NYSE to plunge $5.875 to $23, a 20% drop. The losses at that point totaled $339 million for the current fiscal year. Sales of the VAX, long the company's biggest moneymaker, continued to decline, which in turn also hurt DEC's lucrative service and maintenance business (this made up more than a third of DEC's revenue of $14 billion in the 1993 fiscal year), which declined 11% year over year to $1.5 billion in the most recent quarter.\nMarket acceptance of DEC Alpha computers and chips had been slower than the company had hoped, even though Alpha's sales for the quarter estimated at $275 million were up significantly from $165 million in the December quarter. DEC had also made a strong push into personal computers and workstations, which had even lower margins than Alpha computers and chips. Also, DEC was playing catchup with its own Unix offerings for client-server networks, as it long emphasized its own VMS software, while corporate computer users based their client-server networks on the industry-standard Unix software (of which Hewlett Packard was one of the market leaders). DEC's problems were similar to that of larger rival IBM, due to the fundamental shift in the computer industry that made it unlikely that DEC could ever again operate profitably at its former size of 120,000 employees, and while its workforce had been reduced to 92,000 people many analysts expected that they would have to cut another 20,000.\nSelloffs.\nDuring the profitable years up until the early 1990s, DEC was a company that boasted that it never had a general layoff. Following the 1992 economic downturn, layoffs became regular events as the company continually downsized to try to stay afloat. Palmer was tasked with the goal of bringing DEC back to profitability, which he attempted to do by changing the established DEC business culture, hiring new executives from outside the company, and selling off various non-core business units:\nAcquisition by Compaq (1998).\nThrough 1997, DEC began discussions with Compaq on a possible merger. Several years earlier, Compaq had considered a bid for DEC but became seriously interested only after DEC's major divestments and refocusing on the Internet in 1997. At that time, Compaq was making strong moves into the enterprise market, and DEC's multivendor global services organization and customer support centers offered a real opportunity to expand their support and sales worldwide. Compaq was not interested in a number of DEC's product lines, which led to the series of sell-offs. Notable among these was DEC's Hudson Fab, which made most of their custom chips, a market that made little sense to Compaq's \"industry standard\" marketing. DEC had previously sold its semiconductor plant in South Queensferry to Motorola in 1995, with an understanding that Motorola would continue to produce Alpha processors at the facility, along with continuing a two-year foundry agreement with AMD to continue producing the Am486 processor.\nThis led to an interesting solution to the problem of selling off the division for a reasonable profit. In May 1997, DEC sued Intel for allegedly infringing on its Alpha patents in designing the original Pentium, Pentium Pro, and Pentium II chips. As part of a settlement, much of DEC's chip design and fabrication business was sold to Intel. This included DEC's StrongARM implementation of the ARM computer architecture, which Intel marketed as the XScale processors commonly used in Pocket PCs. The core of Digital Semiconductor, the Alpha microprocessor group, remained with DEC, while the associated office buildings went to Intel as part of the Hudson fab.\nOn January 26, 1998, what remained of the company was sold to Compaq in what was the largest merger up to that time in the computer industry. At the time of Compaq's acquisition announcement, DEC had a total of 53,500 employees, down from a peak of 130,000 in the 1980s, but it still employed about 65% more people than Compaq to produce about half the volume of sales revenues. After the merger closed, Compaq moved aggressively to reduce DEC's high selling, general, and administrative (SG&amp;A) costs (equal to 24% of total 1997 revenues) and bring them more in line with Compaq's SG&amp;A expense ratio of 12% of revenues.\nCompaq used the acquisition to move into enterprise services and compete with IBM, and by 2001 services made up over 20% of Compaq's revenues, largely due to the DEC employees inherited from the merger. DEC's own PC manufacturing was discontinued after the merger closed. As Compaq did not wish to compete with one of its key partner suppliers, the remainder of Digital Semiconductor (the Alpha microprocessor group) was sold to Intel, which placed those employees back in their Hudson (Massachusetts) office, which they had vacated when the site was sold to Intel in 1997.\nCompaq struggled as a result of the merger with DEC, and was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2002. Compaq, and later HP, continued to sell many of the former DEC products but re-branded with their own logos. For example, HP now sells what were formerly DEC's StorageWorks disk/tape products, as a result of the Compaq acquisition.\nThe Digital logo was used up until 2004, even after the company ceased to exist, as the logo of Digital GlobalSoft, an IT services company in India (which was a 51% subsidiary of Compaq). Digital GlobalSoft was later renamed \"HP GlobalSoft\" (also known as the \"HP Global Delivery India Center\" or HP GDIC), and no longer uses the Digital logo.\nResearch and people.\nDEC's Research Laboratories (or Research Labs, as they were commonly known) conducted DEC's corporate research. Some of them were continued in operation by Compaq and are still operated by Hewlett-Packard. The laboratories were:\nSome of the former employees of DEC's Research Labs or DEC's R&amp;D in general include:\nSome of the former employees of Digital Equipment Corp were responsible for developing DEC Alpha and StrongARM:\nGrace Hopper worked for Digital Equipment Corporation as a consultant after her retirement from the United States Navy\nSome of the work of the Research Labs was published in the \"Digital Technical Journal\", which was in published from 1985 until 1998. At least some of the research reports are available online.\nLegacy and accomplishments.\n, decades-old hardware (including PDP-11, VAX, and AlphaServer) is being emulated to allow legacy software to run on modern hardware; funding for this is planned to last at least until 2030.\nDEC supported the ANSI standards, especially the ASCII character set, which survives in Unicode and the ISO 8859 character set family. DEC's own Multinational Character Set also had a large influence on ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) and, by extension, Unicode.\nBeyond DECsystem-10/20, PDP, VAX and Alpha, DEC was known for its work in communication subsystem designs, such as Ethernet, DNA (DIGITAL Network Architecture: predominantly DECnet products), DSA (Digital Storage Architecture: disks/tapes/controllers), and its \"dumb terminal\" subsystems including VT100 and DECserver products.\nHardware.\nDECtape.\nOne of the most unusual peripherals produced for the PDP-10 was the DECtape. The DECtape was a length of special 3/4-inch wide magnetic tape wound on 5-inch reels. The recording format was a highly reliable redundant 10-track design using fixed-length numbered data \"blocks\" organized into a standard file structure, including a directory. Files could be written, read, changed, and deleted on a DECtape as though it were a disk drive. For greater efficiency, the DECtape drive could read and write to a DECtape in both directions.\nIn fact, some PDP-10 systems had no disks at all, using DECtapes alone for their primary data storage. The DECtape was also widely used on other PDP models, since it was much easier to use than hand-loading multiple paper tapes. Primitive early time-sharing systems could use DECtapes as system devices and swapping devices. Although superior to paper tape, DECtapes were relatively slow, and were supplanted once reliable disk drives became affordable.\nMagnetic disk storage.\nDEC was both a manufacturer and a buyer of magnetic disk storage, offering more than 100 different models of hard disk drive (HDD) and floppy disk drive (FDD) during its existence. In the 1970s, it was the single largest OEM purchaser of HDDs, procuring from Diablo, Control Data Corporation, Information Storage Systems, and Memorex, among others.\nDEC's first internally developed HDD was the RS08, a 256 kWord fixed-head contact-start-stop drive using plated media; it shipped in 1969.\nBeginning in the 1970s, DEC moved first its HDD manufacturing and then its mass storage development labs to Colorado Springs.\nDEC pioneered a number of HDD technologies, including sampled data servos (RL01, 1977) and serial HDD interfaces (Standard Disk Interconnect, 1983). The last internally developed disk drive family (RA9x series) used plated media, departing from the HDD industry trend to carbon overcoated sputtered media. DEC designated a $400 million investment to bring this product line into production. The RA92 (1.5 GB) was introduced in 1992, using a 14-inch platter.\nDEC purchased its FDDs from OEMs such as Shugart Associates, Toshiba, and Sony.\nRX50.\nThe way the 400\u00a0KB DEC standard RX50 floppy disk drive supported DEC's initial offerings seemed to encapsulate their approach to the personal computer market. Although the mechanical drive hardware was nearly identical to other 5 \" floppy disk drives available on competing systems, DEC sought to differentiate their product by using a proprietary disk format for the data written on the disk. The DEC format had a higher capacity for data, but the RX50 drives were incompatible with other PC floppy drives. This required DEC owners to buy higher-priced, specially formatted floppy media, which was harder to obtain through standard distribution channels. DEC attempted to enforce exclusive control over its floppy media sales by copyrighting its proprietary disk format, and requiring a negotiated license agreement and royalty payments from anybody selling compatible media. The proprietary data format meant that RX50 floppies were not interchangeable with other PC floppies, further isolating DEC products from the developing de facto standard PC market. Hardware hackers and DEC enthusiasts eventually reverse-engineered the RX50 format, but the damage had already been done, in terms of market confusion and isolation.\nVideo and Interactive Information Server.\nThe Video-on-Demand project at DEC started in 1992, following Ken Olsen's retirement. At the time the company was rapidly downsizing under Robert Palmer, and it was difficult to gain funding for any new project. DEC's Interactive Video Information Server architecture gained traction and excelled over those of other companies, in that it was highly scalable, using a gateway to set up interactive video delivery sessions on large numbers of video and information servers. Initially high-end VAXes were used, then Alphas.\nThe scalability feature allowed it to win contracts for many of the video-on-demand trials in the 1993\u201395 timeframe, since the system could theoretically accommodate unlimited interactive video streams and other non-video content.\nThe design was proposed and incorporated into the MPEG-2 international standard. Its object-oriented interface became the mandatory user-to user core interface in DSM-CC, widely used in video stream and file delivery for MPEG-2 compliant systems.\nCommercially, DEC's Digital and Interactive Information System was used by Adlink to distribute advertising to over two million subscribers.\nUser organizations.\nOriginally the users' group was called DECUS (Digital Equipment Computer User Society) during the 1960s to 1990s. When Compaq acquired DEC in 1998, the users group was renamed CUO, the Compaq Users' Organisation.

The band was one of the defining punk bands during its initial eight-year run.\nInitially consisting of lead guitarist East Bay Ray, bassist Klaus Flouride, lead vocalist Jello Biafra, drummer Ted and rhythm guitarist 6025, 6025 left in 1979, and Ted left the following year after the band recorded their acclaimed first album \"Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables\" (1980). The band's longest-serving drummer was D. H. Peligro, who replaced Ted in 1981 and remained until his death in 2022. Dead Kennedys recorded the EP \"In God We Trust Inc.\" (1981), followed by three more studio albums, \"Plastic Surgery Disasters\" (1982), \"Frankenchrist\" (1985), and \"Bedtime for Democracy\" (1986), the latter of which was recorded and released shortly after announcing their breakup in January 1986. Most of the band's recordings were released on Alternative Tentacles, an independent record label founded by Biafra and East Bay Ray.\nFollowing Dead Kennedys' dissolution, Biafra continued to run Alternative Tentacles, and went on to collaborate and record with other artists, including D.O.A., NoMeansNo and his own bands Lard and the Guantanamo School of Medicine, as well as releasing several spoken word performances. In 2000 (upheld on appeal in 2003), Biafra lost an acrimonious legal case initiated by his former Dead Kennedys bandmates over songwriting credits and unpaid royalties. In 2001, the band reformed without Biafra; various singers have since been recruited for vocal duties. Although Dead Kennedys have continued to perform over the years, they have not released any more studio albums since \"Bedtime for Democracy\".\nDead Kennedys' lyrics were usually political in nature, satirizing political figures and authority in general, as well as popular culture and even the punk movement itself. During their initial incarnation between 1978 and 1986, they attracted considerable controversy for their provocative lyrics and artwork. Several stores refused to stock their recordings, provoking debate about censorship in rock music; in the mid-1980s, vocalist and primary lyricist Jello Biafra became an active campaigner against the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC). This culminated in an obscenity trial between 1985 and 1986, which resulted in a hung jury and also hastened the band's demise.\nHistory.\nFormation of the band (1978\u20131979).\nDead Kennedys were formed in June 1978 in San Francisco, California, when East Bay Ray (Raymond Pepperell) advertised for bandmates in the newspaper \"The Recycler\", after seeing a ska-punk show at Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco. The original band lineup consisted of East Bay Ray on lead guitar, Klaus Flouride (Geoffrey Lyall) on bass, Jello Biafra (Eric Reed Boucher) on vocals, Ted (Bruce Slesinger) on drums and 6025 (Carlos Cadona) on rhythm guitar. This lineup recorded their first demos. Their first live show was on July 19, 1978 at Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco, California. They were the opening act on a bill that included DV8 and Negative Trend with The Offs headlining.\nDead Kennedys played numerous shows at local venues afterward. Due to the provocative name of the band, they sometimes played under pseudonyms, including \"The DK's\", \"The Sharks\", \"The Creamsicles\" and \"The Pink Twinkies\". \"San Francisco Chronicle\" columnist Herb Caen wrote in November 1978, \"Just when you think tastelessness has reached its nadir, along comes a punk rock group called 'The Dead Kennedys', which will play at Mabuhay Gardens on Nov. 22, the 15th anniversary of John F. Kennedy's assassination.\" Despite mounting protests, the owner of Mabuhay declared, \"I can't cancel them NOW\u2014there's a contract. Not, apparently, the kind of contract some people have in mind.\" However, despite popular belief, the name was not meant to insult the Kennedy family, but according to Ray, \"the assassinations were in much more poor taste than our band. We actually respect the Kennedy family. . . . When JFK was assassinated, when Martin Luther King was assassinated, when RFK was assassinated, the American Dream was assassinated. . . . Our name is actually homage to the American Dream.\"\n6025 left the band in March 1979 under somewhat unclear circumstances, generally considered to be musical differences. In June, the band released their first single, \"California \u00dcber Alles\", on Biafra and East Bay Ray's independent label, Alternative Tentacles. The band followed with a poorly attended East Coast tour, being a new and fairly unknown band at the time, without a full album release.\n\"Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables\" (1980\u20131981).\nIn early 1980, they recorded and released the single \"Holiday in Cambodia\". In June, the band recorded their debut album, \"Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables\", released in September of that year on the UK label Cherry Red. The album reached number 33 on the UK Albums Chart. Since its initial release, it has been re-released by several other labels, including IRS, Alternative Tentacles, and Cleopatra. The 2005 reissue\u2014the special 25th-anniversary edition\u2014features the original artwork and a bonus 55-minute DVD documenting the making of the album as well as the band's early years.\nOn March 25, 1980, Dead Kennedys were invited to perform at the Bay Area Music Awards in an effort to give the event some \"new wave credibility\", in the words of the organizers. The day of the performance was spent practicing the song they were asked to play, the underground hit \"California \u00fcber alles\". The band became the talking point of the ceremony when after about 15 seconds into the song, Biafra stopped the band\u2014in a manner reminiscent of Elvis Costello's \"Saturday Night Live\" appearance\u2014and said, \"Hold it! We've gotta prove that we're adults now. We're not a punk rock band, we're a new wave band.\" The band, all wearing white shirts with a big, black S painted on the front, pulled black ties from around the backs of their necks to form a dollar sign, then started playing a new song titled \"Pull My Strings\", a barbed, satirical attack on the ethics of the mainstream music industry, which contained the lyrics, \"Is my cock big enough, is my brain small enough, for you to make me a star?\". The song also referenced The Knack's song \"My Sharona\". \"Pull My Strings\" was never recorded for a studio release, though the performance at the Bay Area Music Awards, which was one of only two times that the song was ever performed, was released on the band's 1987 compilation album \"Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death\". In a 2017 interview about the show Klaus stated, \"We did one other performance of it at The Mabuhay and that was the only other time we performed it... like within a week of the Bammies\" It\u2019s unknown if this performance was ever recorded.\nIn January 1981, Ted announced that he wanted to leave to pursue a career in architecture and would help look for a replacement. He played his last concert in February 1981. His replacement was D.\u00a0H. Peligro (Darren Henley). Around the same time, East Bay Ray had tried to pressure the rest of the band to sign to the major record label Polydor Records; Biafra stated that he was prepared to leave the group if the rest of the band wanted to sign to the label, though East Bay Ray asserts that he recommended against signing with Polydor. Polydor decided not to sign the band after they learned that Dead Kennedys' next single was to be entitled \"Too Drunk to Fuck\".\nWhen \"Too Drunk to Fuck\" came out in May 1981 it caused controversy in the UK, as the BBC feared the single would reach the Top 30, which would necessitate its title being mentioned on \"Top of the Pops\". It was never played, although it was simply called \"'Too Drunk' by the Kennedys\" by presenter Tony Blackburn.\n\"In God We Trust, Inc.\", \"Plastic Surgery Disasters\" and Alternative Tentacles Records (1981\u20131985).\nAfter Peligro joined the band, the extended play \"In God We Trust, Inc.\" (1981) saw them move toward a more aggressive hardcore/thrash sound. In addition to the EP's controversial artwork depicting a gold Christ figure on a cross of dollar bills, the lyrics contained Biafra's most biting social and political commentary yet, and songs such as \"Moral Majority\", \"Nazi Punks Fuck Off!\" and \"We've Got a Bigger Problem Now\" placed Dead Kennedys as the spokesmen of social protest, while \"Dog Bite\", a cover version of \"Rawhide\" and various joke introductions showed a much more whimsical side. In 1982, they released their second studio album, \"Plastic Surgery Disasters\". The album's cover features a withered starving African child's hand being held and dwarfed by a white man's hand, a picture that had won the World Press Photo award in 1980, taken in Karamoja district in Uganda by Mike Wells.\nThe band's music had evolved considerably in a short time, moving away from hardcore formulae toward a more innovative jazz-informed style, featuring musicianship and dynamics far beyond other bands in the genre (thus effectively removing the music from that genre). By now the group had become a de facto political force, pitting itself against rising elements of American social and political life such as the religious right, Ronald Reagan and the idle rich. The band continued touring all over the United States, as well as Europe and Australia, and gained a large underground following. While they continued to play live shows during 1983 and 1984, they took a break from releasing new records to concentrate on the Alternative Tentacles record label, which would become synonymous with DIY alternative culture. The band continued to write and perform new material during this time, which would appear on their next album (some of these early performances can be seen in the \"DMPO's on Broadway\" video, originally released by Dirk Dirksen and later reissued on Rhino).\n\"Frankenchrist\" and obscenity trial (1985\u20131986).\nThe release of the album \"Frankenchrist\" in 1985 showed the band had grown in musical proficiency and lyrical maturity. While there were still a number of loud/fast songs, much of the music featured an eclectic mix of instruments including trumpets and synthesizers. Around this time Klaus Flouride released the similarly experimental solo EP \"Cha Cha Cha With Mr. Flouride\". Lyrically, the band continued their trademark social commentary, with songs such as \"MTV Get Off The Air\" and \"Jock-O-Rama (Invasion of the Beef Patrol)\" poking fun at mainstream America.\nHowever, the controversy that erupted over H.R. Giger's \"Penis Landscape\", included as an insert with the album, dwarfed the notoriety of its music. The artwork caused a furor with the newly formed Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC). In December 1985 a teenage girl purchased the album at the Wherehouse Records store in Los Angeles County. The girl's mother wrote letters of complaint to the California Attorney General and to Los Angeles prosecutors. In June 1986, members of the band, along with other parties involved in the distribution of \"Frankenchrist\", were charged criminally with distribution of harmful matter to minors. The store where the teen actually purchased the album was never named in the lawsuit. The criminal charges focused on an illustration by H.R. Giger, titled \"Work 219: Landscape XX\" (also known as \"Penis Landscape\"). Included as a poster with the album, \"Penis Landscape\" depicts nine copulating penises and vaginas.\nMembers of the band and others in the chain of distribution were charged with violating the California Penal Code on a misdemeanor charge carrying a maximum penalty of up to a year in county jail and a base fine of up to $2,000. Biafra says that during this time government agents invaded and searched his home. The prosecution tried to present the poster to the jury in isolation for consideration as obscene material, but Judge Susan Isacoff ruled that the poster must be considered along with the music and lyrics. The charges against three of the original defendants, Ruth Schwartz (owner of Mordam Records), Steve Boudreau (a distributor involved in supplying \"Frankenchrist\" to the Los Angeles Wherehouse store), and Salvatore Alberti (owner of the factory where the record was pressed), were dismissed for lack of evidence.\nIn August 1987, the case went to the jury with two remaining defendants: Jello Biafra and Michael Bonanno (former Alternative Tentacles label manager). However, the criminal trial ended with a hung jury, split 7 to 5 in favor of acquittal. District Attorneys Michael Guarino and Ira Riener made a motion for a retrial which was denied by Judge Isacoff, Superior Court Judge for the County of Los Angeles. The album, however, was banned from many record stores nationwide.\nAfter the break up of the band, Jello Biafra brought up the court case on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\". Biafra was on the show with Tipper Gore as part of a panel discussion on the issues of \"controversial music lyrics\" and censorship.\n\"Bedtime for Democracy\" and break-up (1986).\nIn addition to the obscenity lawsuit, the band became increasingly disillusioned with the underground scene as well. The hardcore scene, which had been a haven for free-thinking intellectuals and downtrodden nonconformists, was attracting a more violent audience that imposed an increasing level of brutality on other concertgoers and began to alienate many of the bands and individuals who had helped pioneer the movement in the early 1980s. In earlier years the band had criticized neo-Nazi skinheads for trying to ruin the punk scene, but just as big a problem was the popularity of increasingly macho hardcore bands, which brought the group (and their genre) an audience that had little to do with the ideas/ideals they stood for. Biafra penned new songs such as \"Chickenshit Conformist\" and \"Anarchy for Sale\" that articulated the band's feelings about the \"dumbing down\" of punk rock. During the summer they recorded these for their final album, \"Bedtime for Democracy\", which was released in November. The artwork, depicting a defaced Statue of Liberty overrun with Nazis, media, opportunists, Klan members, corrupt government officials, and religious zombies, echoed the idea that neither America itself or the punk scene were safe havens any more for \"your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free\". The album contains a number of fast/short songs interspersed with jazz (\"D.M.S.O.\"), spoken word (\"A Commercial\") and psychedelia (\"Cesspools In Eden\").\nThe band decided to split up in January 1986, prior to the recording and release of \"Bedtime for Democracy\", and played their last live show with the original lineup on 21 February. Biafra went on to speak about his political beliefs on numerous television shows and he released a number of spoken-word albums. Ray, Flouride, and Peligro also went on to solo careers.\nReforming of new band line-up and death of Peligro (2001\u2013present).\nIn 2001, Ray, Peligro, and Flouride reformed the Dead Kennedys, with former Dr. Know singer Brandon Cruz replacing Biafra on vocals. The band played under the name \"DK Kennedys\" for a few concerts, but later reverted to \"Dead Kennedys\" permanently. They played across the continental United States, Europe, Asia, South America, and Russia. Brandon Cruz left the band in May 2003 and was replaced by Jeff Penalty. The band has released two live albums of archival performances on Manifesto Records: \"Mutiny on the Bay\", compiled from various live shows including a recording from their last show with Biafra in 1986, and \"Live at the Deaf Club\", a recording of a 1979 performance at the Deaf Club in San Francisco which was greeted with more enthusiasm.\nOn October 9, 2007, a best of album titled \"Milking the Sacred Cow\" was released. It includes two previously unreleased live versions of \"Soup Is Good Food\" and \"Jock-O-Rama\", originally found on \"Frankenchrist\".\nJeff Penalty left the band in March 2008 in what he describes as a \"not amicable split.\" In a statement released, Jeff said that, following a series of disputes, the band had secretly recruited a new singer and played a gig in his neighbourhood, although he also stated he was \"really proud of what we were able to accomplish with Dead Kennedys\". He was replaced by former Wynona Riders singer Ron \"Skip\" Greer. D.\u00a0H. Peligro also left the band to \"take some personal time off\". He was replaced for a tour by Translator drummer Dave Scheff.\nOn August 21, 2008, the band announced an extended break from touring due to the health-related issues of Flouride and Peligro. They stated their plans to collaborate on new projects. The band performed a gig in Santa Rosa, California in June 2009, with Peligro returning to the drum kit.\nIn August 2010, Dead Kennedys announced plans for a short East Coast tour. The lineup assembled for this tour contained East Bay Ray, Peligro, Greer, and bassist Greg Reeves replacing Flouride, who was taking \"personal time off\" from the band. The tour dates included performances in Philadelphia, New York City, Boston, Washington, D.C., Portland, Maine and Hawaii. The band has played a reworked version of their song \"MTV Get Off the Air\", re-titled \"MP3 Get Off the Web\", with lyrics criticizing music piracy during their October 16, 2010, concert at the Rock and Roll Hotel in Washington, D.C.\nDead Kennedys had world tours in 2013 and in 2014, the latter mostly in North American cities. In 2015 and 2016 they toured again, including South America, where they had not played since 2001.\nIn 2017, East Bay Ray revealed that the band and Jello Biafra had been approached by the Punk-oriented music festival Riot Fest about a potential reunion. While Ray and the rest of the band expressed interest in the concept, Biafra refused.\nOn April 26, 2019, the group released \"DK40\", a live compilation album celebrating 40 years since the band formed.\nOn October 28, 2022, D.H. Peligro died from an overdose of heroin and fentanyl, although it was initially believed to have been from possible head trauma from a fall at his home that day. Since Peligro's death, the band has performed in the UK with Santi Guardiola and the United States with Steve Wilson (who had played in D.H.Peligro's band Peligro before) filling in on drums.\nConflicts between members.\nRoyalties lawsuit.\nIn the late 1990s, former band members discovered they were being underpaid in terms of royalties from Alternative Tentacles. East Bay Ray, Klaus Flouride, and D.\u00a0H. Peligro claimed that Jello Biafra had conspired to pay them lower royalty rates and then attempted to disguise the precise nature of the money owed. Biafra claimed that the failure to pay these royalties was an accounting mistake.\nIn 1998, the other three members of the band sued Biafra over these allegedly unpaid royalties. A jury ruled in their favor in May 2000, finding Biafra and Alternative Tentacles \"guilty of malice, oppression and fraud\". Malice was defined for the jury as \"conduct which is intended to cause injury or despicable conduct which is carried with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights of others\". Biafra's appeal was denied in June 2003; he had to pay the outstanding royalties as well as punitive damages, and was forced to hand over the rights to the majority of Dead Kennedys' back catalogue to the Decay Music partnership.\nThis dispute caused minor waves within punk circles. Biafra claims that East Bay Ray had long expressed displeasure with Alternative Tentacles and with the amount of money he received from them, thus the original incentive for the discovery of the back payments. It was found out that Alternative Tentacles was paying Dead Kennedys less per CD than all the other bands, including Biafra himself, and not informing his other bandmates, which was the fraud. Biafra accused the band of wanting to license the famous Dead Kennedys song \"Holiday in Cambodia\" for use in a Levi's jeans commercial, which the band denied. However, an instrumental loop from \"Holiday in Cambodia\" was part of the 1981 black comedy feature film \"Neighbors\", though it was not included on the soundtrack. The band maintains that the Levi's story was completely fictitious and invented by Biafra to discredit them.\nDisputes over new commercial activities.\nMatters were stirred up even further when the three bandmates invited Jello Biafra to \"bury the hatchet\" in the form of a band reunion. Jello Biafra felt it was unprofessional because no one contacted him directly. In addition, Biafra was dismissive of the reunion, and having long expressed his disdain for nostalgia and rock reunion/oldies tours in particular, argued that the whole affair was motivated by greed.\nSeveral DVDs, re-issues, and live albums have been released since the departure of Biafra most recently on Manifesto Records. According to Biafra, the live albums are \"cash-ins\" on Dead Kennedys' name and his music. Biafra also accused the releases of the new live material of having poor sound quality. Furthermore, he has stated he is not receiving any royalties from the sale of any Manifesto Records releases. Consequently, he has discouraged fans from buying any Dead Kennedy reissues. The other band members denied Biafra's accusations regarding the live releases, and have defended the mixes as an effort of hard work. Biafra dismissed the new group as \"the world's greediest karaoke band.\" Nevertheless, in 2003, Klaus Flouride said of performances without the band's former frontman: \"There hasn't been a show yet that people didn't really like.\"\nBiafra further criticized them for advertising shows using his own image taken from the original 1980s incarnation of the band, which he labeled as false advertising. He attacked the reformed Dead Kennedys in a song called \"Those Dumb Punk Kids (Will Buy Anything)\", which appears on his second collaboration with sludge metal band the Melvins, \"Sieg Howdy!\"\nBiafra told an audience at a speaking gig in Trenton, New Jersey, that the remaining Dead Kennedys have licensed their single \"Too Drunk to Fuck\" to be used in a rape scene in a Robert Rodriguez movie. The reference is to a lounge cover of the song, recorded by the band Nouvelle Vague, played during a scene in the \"Planet Terror\" segment of \"Grindhouse\", although no rape takes place, and in fact the would-be rapist is killed by the would-be victim. The scene in \"Planet Terror\" has would-be rapist, \"Rapist No.\u00a01\" (Quentin Tarantino) order one-legged stripper \"Cherry Darlin\" (Rose McGowan) to get up off the floor and dance. At this point Tarantino hits play on a cassette recorder and Nouvelle Vague's cover of \"Too Drunk To Fuck\" plays. Biafra, disapproving of the situation, later wrote, \"This is their lowest point since Levi's... This goes against everything the Dead Kennedys stands for in spades... The terrified woman later 'wins' by killing Tarantino, but that excuse does not rescue this at all. I wrote every note of that song and this is not what it was meant for... Some people will do anything for money. I can't help but think back to how prudish Klaus Flouride was when he objected to H. R. Giger's painting on the \"Frankenchrist\" (sic) poster, saying he couldn't bear to show it to his parents. I'd sure love to be a fly on the wall when he tries to explain putting a song in a rape scene for money to his teenage daughter... The deal was pushed through by a new business manager the other three hired.\"\nThe reformed Dead Kennedys followed their court victory by releasing reissues of all Dead Kennedys albums (except \"Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables\", to which they did not have the rights until 2005), releasing several new archival concert DVDs, and licensing several songs to \"The Manchurian Candidate\" remake and the \"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater\" video game. East Bay Ray claims he received a fax from Alternative Tentacles purporting Biafra approved the licensing for the game.\nThe band claims on their website that they still pay close attention to an anti-corporate ideology, despite performing on September 5, 2003, at a festival in Turkey that was sponsored by Coca-Cola, noting that they have since pulled out of a show in Los Angeles when they found that it was being sponsored by Coors. However, Biafra claims the previous licensing deals prove otherwise.\nArtistry.\nMusic and lyrics.\nDead Kennedys have been described as one of the first hardcore punk bands. They were noted for the harshness of their lyrics, which generally combined biting social satire while expressing a staunchly left-wing view of contemporary America. Unlike other leftist punk bands who use more direct sloganeering, Dead Kennedys' lyrics were often snide. For example, \"Holiday in Cambodia\" is a multi-layered satire targeting both yuppies and Cambodia's recently deposed Khmer Rouge regime. Or, on \"Jock-O-Rama\", featured on \"Frankenchrist\", they mock southern small towns whose residents\u2019 lives revolve around high school football.\nLogo.\nThe original logo was created by Winston Smith. He later contributed artwork for the covers of \"In God We Trust, Inc.\", \"Plastic Surgery Disasters\", \"Frankenchrist\", \"Bedtime for Democracy\", \"Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death\", the back cover of the \"Kill the Poor\" single and the Alternative Tentacles logo. When asked about the \"DK\" logo in an interview, Jello Biafra explained, \"...I wanted to make sure it was something simple and easy to spray-paint so people would graffiti it all over the place, and then I showed it to Winston Smith. He played around with it, came back with a bunch of designs that had the circle and slightly 3-D looking letters and he had ones with different patterns behind it. I liked the one with bricks, but ultimately I thought simple red behind it was the boldest and the best.\"\nInfluence.\nDead Kennedys have influenced multiple acts such as System of a Down, Green Day, Faith No More, Rage Against the Machine, Sepultura, Descendents, Bad Religion, Slayer, X, Minutemen, The Hives, Saves the Day and Screeching Weasel among others.\nMembers.\nCurrent members\nFormer members"}
{"id": "7955", "revid": "47406457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7955", "title": "DNA", "text": "Deoxyribonucleic acid (; DNA) is a polymer composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix. The polymer carries genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses. DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are nucleic acids. Alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), nucleic acids are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life.\nThe two DNA strands are known as polynucleotides as they are composed of simpler monomeric units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases (cytosine [C], guanine [G], adenine [A] or thymine [T]), a sugar called deoxyribose, and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds (known as the phosphodiester linkage) between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups, the single-ringed pyrimidines and the double-ringed purines. In DNA, the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine; the purines are adenine and guanine.\nBoth strands of double-stranded DNA store the same biological information. This information is replicated when the two strands separate. A large part of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is non-coding, meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences. The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are thus antiparallel. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (or \"bases\"). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes genetic information. RNA strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called transcription, where DNA bases are exchanged for their corresponding bases except in the case of thymine (T), for which RNA substitutes uracil (U). Under the genetic code, these RNA strands specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins in a process called translation.\nWithin eukaryotic cells, DNA is organized into long structures called chromosomes. Before typical cell division, these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of DNA replication, providing a complete set of chromosomes for each daughter cell. Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants, fungi and protists) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus as nuclear DNA, and some in the mitochondria as mitochondrial DNA or in chloroplasts as chloroplast DNA. In contrast, prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm, in circular chromosomes. Within eukaryotic chromosomes, chromatin proteins, such as histones, compact and organize DNA. These compacting structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.\nProperties.\nDNA is a long polymer made from repeating units called nucleotides. The structure of DNA is dynamic along its length, being capable of coiling into tight loops and other shapes. In all species it is composed of two helical chains, bound to each other by hydrogen bonds. Both chains are coiled around the same axis, and have the same pitch of . The pair of chains have a radius of . According to another study, when measured in a different solution, the DNA chain measured wide, and one nucleotide unit measured long. The buoyant density of most DNA is 1.7g/cm3.\nDNA does not usually exist as a single strand, but instead as a pair of strands that are held tightly together. These two long strands coil around each other, in the shape of a double helix. The nucleotide contains both a segment of the backbone of the molecule (which holds the chain together) and a nucleobase (which interacts with the other DNA strand in the helix). A nucleobase linked to a sugar is called a nucleoside, and a base linked to a sugar and to one or more phosphate groups is called a nucleotide. A biopolymer comprising multiple linked nucleotides (as in DNA) is called a polynucleotide.\nThe backbone of the DNA strand is made from alternating phosphate and sugar groups. The sugar in DNA is 2-deoxyribose, which is a pentose (five-carbon) sugar. The sugars are joined by phosphate groups that form phosphodiester bonds between the third and fifth carbon atoms of adjacent sugar rings. These are known as the 3\u2032-end (three prime end), and 5\u2032-end (five prime end) carbons, the prime symbol being used to distinguish these carbon atoms from those of the base to which the deoxyribose forms a glycosidic bond.\nTherefore, any DNA strand normally has one end at which there is a phosphate group attached to the 5\u2032 carbon of a ribose (the 5\u2032 phosphoryl) and another end at which there is a free hydroxyl group attached to the 3\u2032 carbon of a ribose (the 3\u2032 hydroxyl). The orientation of the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 carbons along the sugar-phosphate backbone confers directionality (sometimes called polarity) to each DNA strand. In a nucleic acid double helix, the direction of the nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand: the strands are antiparallel. The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are said to have a directionality of five prime end (5\u2032 ), and three prime end (3\u2032), with the 5\u2032 end having a terminal phosphate group and the 3\u2032 end a terminal hydroxyl group. One major difference between DNA and RNA is the sugar, with the 2-deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the related pentose sugar ribose in RNA.\nThe DNA double helix is stabilized primarily by two forces: hydrogen bonds between nucleotides and base-stacking interactions among aromatic nucleobases. The four bases found in DNA are adenine (), cytosine (), guanine () and thymine (). These four bases are attached to the sugar-phosphate to form the complete nucleotide, as shown for adenosine monophosphate. Adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine, forming and base pairs.\nNucleobase classification.\nThe nucleobases are classified into two types: the purines, and , which are fused five- and six-membered heterocyclic compounds, and the pyrimidines, the six-membered rings and . A fifth pyrimidine nucleobase, uracil (), usually takes the place of thymine in RNA and differs from thymine by lacking a methyl group on its ring. In addition to RNA and DNA, many artificial nucleic acid analogues have been created to study the properties of nucleic acids, or for use in biotechnology.\nNon-canonical bases.\nModified bases occur in DNA. The first of these recognized was 5-methylcytosine, which was found in the genome of \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\" in 1925. The reason for the presence of these noncanonical bases in bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) is to avoid the restriction enzymes present in bacteria. This enzyme system acts at least in part as a molecular immune system protecting bacteria from infection by viruses. Modifications of the bases cytosine and adenine, the more common and modified DNA bases, play vital roles in the epigenetic control of gene expression in plants and animals.\nA number of noncanonical bases are known to occur in DNA. Most of these are modifications of the canonical bases plus uracil.\nGrooves.\nTwin helical strands form the DNA backbone. Another double helix may be found tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These voids are adjacent to the base pairs and may provide a binding site. As the strands are not symmetrically located with respect to each other, the grooves are unequally sized. The major groove is wide, while the minor groove is in width. Due to the larger width of the major groove, the edges of the bases are more accessible in the major groove than in the minor groove. As a result, proteins such as transcription factors that can bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually make contact with the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove. This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell \"(see below)\", but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in width that would be seen if the DNA was twisted back into the ordinary B form.\nBase pairing.\nTop, a ' base pair with three hydrogen bonds. Bottom, an ' base pair with two hydrogen bonds. Non-covalent hydrogen bonds between the pairs are shown as dashed lines.\nIn a DNA double helix, each type of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called complementary base pairing. Purines form hydrogen bonds to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix (from six-carbon ring to six-carbon ring) is called a Watson-Crick base pair. DNA with high GC-content is more stable than DNA with low -content. A Hoogsteen base pair (hydrogen bonding the 6-carbon ring to the 5-carbon ring) is a rare variation of base-pairing. As hydrogen bonds are not covalent, they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can thus be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high temperature. As a result of this base pair complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in organisms.\nssDNA vs. dsDNA.\nMost DNA molecules are actually two polymer strands, bound together in a helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double-stranded (dsDNA) structure is maintained largely by the intrastrand base stacking interactions, which are strongest for stacks. The two strands can come apart\u2014a process known as melting\u2014to form two single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules. Melting occurs at high temperatures, low salt and high pH (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).\nThe stability of the dsDNA form depends not only on the -content (% basepairs) but also on sequence (since stacking is sequence specific) and also length (longer molecules are more stable). The stability can be measured in various ways; a common way is the melting temperature (also called \"Tm\" value), which is the temperature at which 50% of the double-strand molecules are converted to single-strand molecules; melting temperature is dependent on ionic strength and the concentration of DNA. As a result, it is both the percentage of base pairs and the overall length of a DNA double helix that determines the strength of the association between the two strands of DNA. Long DNA helices with a high -content have more strongly interacting strands, while short helices with high content have more weakly interacting strands. In biology, parts of the DNA double helix that need to separate easily, such as the Pribnow box in some promoters, tend to have a high content, making the strands easier to pull apart.\nIn the laboratory, the strength of this interaction can be measured by finding the melting temperature \"Tm\" necessary to break half of the hydrogen bonds. When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt, the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules. These single-stranded DNA molecules have no single common shape, but some conformations are more stable than others.\nAmount.\nIn humans, the total female diploid nuclear genome per cell extends for 6.37 Gigabase pairs (Gbp), is 208.23\u00a0cm long and weighs 6.51 picograms (pg). Male values are 6.27 Gbp, 205.00\u00a0cm, 6.41 pg. Each DNA polymer can contain hundreds of millions of nucleotides, such as in chromosome 1. Chromosome 1 is the largest human chromosome with approximately 220 million base pairs, and would be long if straightened.\nIn eukaryotes, in addition to nuclear DNA, there is also mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) which encodes certain proteins used by the mitochondria. The mtDNA is usually relatively small in comparison to the nuclear DNA. For example, the human mitochondrial DNA forms closed circular molecules, each of which contains 16,569 DNA base pairs, with each such molecule normally containing a full set of the mitochondrial genes. Each human mitochondrion contains, on average, approximately 5 such mtDNA molecules. Each human cell contains approximately 100 mitochondria, giving a total number of mtDNA molecules per human cell of approximately 500. However, the amount of mitochondria per cell also varies by cell type, and an egg cell can contain 100,000 mitochondria, corresponding to up to 1,500,000 copies of the mitochondrial genome (constituting up to 90% of the DNA of the cell).\nSense and antisense.\nA DNA sequence is called a \"sense\" sequence if it is the same as that of a messenger RNA copy that is translated into protein. The sequence on the opposite strand is called the \"antisense\" sequence. Both sense and antisense sequences can exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA (i.e. both strands can contain both sense and antisense sequences). In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, antisense RNA sequences are produced, but the functions of these RNAs are not entirely clear. One proposal is that antisense RNAs are involved in regulating gene expression through RNA-RNA base pairing.\nA few DNA sequences in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and more in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes. In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read in the opposite direction along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.\nSupercoiling.\nDNA can be twisted like a rope in a process called DNA supercoiling. With DNA in its \"relaxed\" state, a strand usually circles the axis of the double helix once every 10.4 base pairs, but if the DNA is twisted the strands become more tightly or more loosely wound. If the DNA is twisted in the direction of the helix, this is positive supercoiling, and the bases are held more tightly together. If they are twisted in the opposite direction, this is negative supercoiling, and the bases come apart more easily. In nature, most DNA has slight negative supercoiling that is introduced by enzymes called topoisomerases. These enzymes are also needed to relieve the twisting stresses introduced into DNA strands during processes such as transcription and DNA replication.\nAlternative DNA structures.\nDNA exists in many possible conformations that include A-DNA, B-DNA, and Z-DNA forms, although only B-DNA and Z-DNA have been directly observed in functional organisms. The conformation that DNA adopts depends on the hydration level, DNA sequence, the amount and direction of supercoiling, chemical modifications of the bases, the type and concentration of metal ions, and the presence of polyamines in solution.\nThe first published reports of A-DNA X-ray diffraction patterns\u2014and also B-DNA\u2014used analyses based on Patterson functions that provided only a limited amount of structural information for oriented fibers of DNA. An alternative analysis was proposed by Wilkins \"et al.\" in 1953 for the \"in vivo\" B-DNA X-ray diffraction-scattering patterns of highly hydrated DNA fibers in terms of squares of Bessel functions. In the same journal, James Watson and Francis Crick presented their molecular modeling analysis of the DNA X-ray diffraction patterns to suggest that the structure was a double helix.\nAlthough the \"B-DNA form\" is most common under the conditions found in cells, it is not a well-defined conformation but a family of related DNA conformations that occur at the high hydration levels present in cells. Their corresponding X-ray diffraction and scattering patterns are characteristic of molecular paracrystals with a significant degree of disorder.\nCompared to B-DNA, the A-DNA form is a wider right-handed spiral, with a shallow, wide minor groove and a narrower, deeper major groove. The A form occurs under non-physiological conditions in partly dehydrated samples of DNA, while in the cell it may be produced in hybrid pairings of DNA and RNA strands, and in enzyme-DNA complexes. Segments of DNA where the bases have been chemically modified by methylation may undergo a larger change in conformation and adopt the Z form. Here, the strands turn about the helical axis in a left-handed spiral, the opposite of the more common B form. These unusual structures can be recognized by specific Z-DNA binding proteins and may be involved in the regulation of transcription.\nAlternative DNA chemistry.\nFor many years, exobiologists have proposed the existence of a shadow biosphere, a postulated microbial biosphere of Earth that uses radically different biochemical and molecular processes than currently known life. One of the proposals was the existence of lifeforms that use arsenic instead of phosphorus in DNA. A report in 2010 of the possibility in the bacterium GFAJ-1 was announced, though the research was disputed, and evidence suggests the bacterium actively prevents the incorporation of arsenic into the DNA backbone and other biomolecules.\nQuadruplex structures.\nAt the ends of the linear chromosomes are specialized regions of DNA called telomeres. The main function of these regions is to allow the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase, as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3\u2032 ends of chromosomes. These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the DNA repair systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected. In human cells, telomeres are usually lengths of single-stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.\nThese guanine-rich sequences may stabilize chromosome ends by forming structures of stacked sets of four-base units, rather than the usual base pairs found in other DNA molecules. Here, four guanine bases, known as a guanine tetrad, form a flat plate. These flat four-base units then stack on top of each other to form a stable G-quadruplex structure. These structures are stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the edges of the bases and chelation of a metal ion in the centre of each four-base unit. Other structures can also be formed, with the central set of four bases coming from either a single strand folded around the bases, or several different parallel strands, each contributing one base to the central structure.\nIn addition to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere-binding proteins. At the very end of the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA and base pairing to one of the two strands. This triple-stranded structure is called a displacement loop or D-loop.\nBranched DNA.\nBranched DNA can form networks containing multiple branches.\nIn DNA, fraying occurs when non-complementary regions exist at the end of an otherwise complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible. Branched DNA can be used in nanotechnology to construct geometric shapes, see the section on uses in technology below.\nArtificial bases.\nSeveral artificial nucleobases have been synthesized, and successfully incorporated in the eight-base DNA analogue named Hachimoji DNA. Dubbed S, B, P, and Z, these artificial bases are capable of bonding with each other in a predictable way (S\u2013B and P\u2013Z), maintain the double helix structure of DNA, and be transcribed to RNA. Their existence could be seen as an indication that there is nothing special about the four natural nucleobases that evolved on Earth. On the other hand, DNA is tightly related to RNA which does not only act as a transcript of DNA but also performs as molecular machines many tasks in cells. For this purpose it has to fold into a structure. It has been shown that to allow to create all possible structures at least four bases are required for the corresponding RNA, while a higher number is also possible but this would be against the natural principle of least effort.\nAcidity.\nThe phosphate groups of DNA give it similar acidic properties to phosphoric acid and it can be considered as a strong acid. It will be fully ionized at a normal cellular pH, releasing protons which leave behind negative charges on the phosphate groups. These negative charges protect DNA from breakdown by hydrolysis by repelling nucleophiles which could hydrolyze it.\nMacroscopic appearance.\nPure DNA extracted from cells forms white, stringy clumps.\nChemical modifications and altered DNA packaging.\nBase modifications and DNA packaging.\nStructure of cytosine with and without the 5-methyl group. Deamination converts 5-methylcytosine into thymine.\nThe expression of genes is influenced by how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called chromatin. Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of methylation of cytosine bases. DNA packaging and its influence on gene expression can also occur by covalent modifications of the histone protein core around which DNA is wrapped in the chromatin structure or else by remodeling carried out by chromatin remodeling complexes (see Chromatin remodeling). There is, further, crosstalk between DNA methylation and histone modification, so they can coordinately affect chromatin and gene expression.\nFor one example, cytosine methylation produces 5-methylcytosine, which is important for X-inactivation of chromosomes. The average level of methylation varies between organisms\u2014the worm \"Caenorhabditis elegans\" lacks cytosine methylation, while vertebrates have higher levels, with up to 1% of their DNA containing 5-methylcytosine. Despite the importance of 5-methylcytosine, it can deaminate to leave a thymine base, so methylated cytosines are particularly prone to mutations. Other base modifications include adenine methylation in bacteria, the presence of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in the brain, and the glycosylation of uracil to produce the \"J-base\" in kinetoplastids.\nDamage.\nDNA can be damaged by many sorts of mutagens, which change the DNA sequence. Mutagens include oxidizing agents, alkylating agents and also high-energy electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light and X-rays. The type of DNA damage produced depends on the type of mutagen. For example, UV light can damage DNA by producing thymine dimers, which are cross-links between pyrimidine bases. On the other hand, oxidants such as free radicals or hydrogen peroxide produce multiple forms of damage, including base modifications, particularly of guanosine, and double-strand breaks. A typical human cell contains about 150,000 bases that have suffered oxidative damage. Of these oxidative lesions, the most dangerous are double-strand breaks, as these are difficult to repair and can produce point mutations, insertions, deletions from the DNA sequence, and chromosomal translocations. These mutations can cause cancer. Because of inherent limits in the DNA repair mechanisms, if humans lived long enough, they would all eventually develop cancer. DNA damages that are naturally occurring, due to normal cellular processes that produce reactive oxygen species, the hydrolytic activities of cellular water, etc., also occur frequently. Although most of these damages are repaired, in any cell some DNA damage may remain despite the action of repair processes. These remaining DNA damages accumulate with age in mammalian postmitotic tissues. This accumulation appears to be an important underlying cause of aging.\nMany mutagens fit into the space between two adjacent base pairs, this is called \"intercalation\". Most intercalators are aromatic and planar molecules; examples include ethidium bromide, acridines, daunomycin, and doxorubicin. For an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix. This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication, causing toxicity and mutations. As a result, DNA intercalators may be carcinogens, and in the case of thalidomide, a teratogen. Others such as benzo[\"a\"]pyrene diol epoxide and aflatoxin form DNA adducts that induce errors in replication. Nevertheless, due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication, other similar toxins are also used in chemotherapy to inhibit rapidly growing cancer cells.\nBiological functions.\nDNA usually occurs as linear chromosomes in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. The set of chromosomes in a cell makes up its genome; the human genome has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes. The information carried by DNA is held in the sequence of pieces of DNA called genes. Transmission of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing. For example, in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then used to make a matching protein sequence in a process called translation, which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. In an alternative fashion, a cell may copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication. The details of these functions are covered in other articles; here the focus is on the interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome.\nGenes and genomes.\nGenomic DNA is tightly and orderly packed in the process called DNA condensation, to fit the small available volumes of the cell. In eukaryotes, DNA is located in the cell nucleus, with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete set of this information in an organism is called its genotype. A gene is a unit of heredity and is a region of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in an organism. Genes contain an open reading frame that can be transcribed, and regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers, which control transcription of the open reading frame.\nIn many species, only a small fraction of the total sequence of the genome encodes protein. For example, only about 1.5% of the human genome consists of protein-coding exons, with over 50% of human DNA consisting of non-coding repetitive sequences. The reasons for the presence of so much noncoding DNA in eukaryotic genomes and the extraordinary differences in genome size, or \"C-value\", among species, represent a long-standing puzzle known as the \"C-value enigma\". However, some DNA sequences that do not code protein may still encode functional non-coding RNA molecules, which are involved in the regulation of gene expression.\nSome noncoding DNA sequences play structural roles in chromosomes. Telomeres and centromeres typically contain few genes but are important for the function and stability of chromosomes. An abundant form of noncoding DNA in humans are pseudogenes, which are copies of genes that have been disabled by mutation. These sequences are usually just molecular fossils, although they can occasionally serve as raw genetic material for the creation of new genes through the process of gene duplication and divergence.\nTranscription and translation.\nA gene is a sequence of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the phenotype of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the amino-acid sequences of proteins is determined by the rules of translation, known collectively as the genetic code. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called \"codons\" formed from a sequence of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).\nIn transcription, the codons of a gene are copied into messenger RNA by RNA polymerase. This RNA copy is then decoded by a ribosome that reads the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to transfer RNA, which carries amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (43\u00a0combinations). These encode the twenty standard amino acids, giving most amino acids more than one possible codon. There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying the end of the coding region; these are the TAG, TAA, and TGA codons, (UAG, UAA, and UGA on the mRNA).\nReplication.\nCell division is essential for an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for DNA replication. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix. In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.\nExtracellular nucleic acids.\nNaked extracellular DNA (eDNA), most of it released by cell death, is nearly ubiquitous in the environment. Its concentration in soil may be as high as 2 \u03bcg/L, and its concentration in natural aquatic environments may be as high at 88 \u03bcg/L. Various possible functions have been proposed for eDNA: it may be involved in horizontal gene transfer; it may provide nutrients; and it may act as a buffer to recruit or titrate ions or antibiotics. Extracellular DNA acts as a functional extracellular matrix component in the biofilms of several bacterial species. It may act as a recognition factor to regulate the attachment and dispersal of specific cell types in the biofilm; it may contribute to biofilm formation; and it may contribute to the biofilm's physical strength and resistance to biological stress.\nCell-free fetal DNA is found in the blood of the mother, and can be sequenced to determine a great deal of information about the developing fetus.\nUnder the name of environmental DNA eDNA has seen increased use in the natural sciences as a survey tool for ecology, monitoring the movements and presence of species in water, air, or on land, and assessing an area's biodiversity.\nNeutrophil extracellular traps.\nNeutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are networks of extracellular fibers, primarily composed of DNA, which allow neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, to kill extracellular pathogens while minimizing damage to the host cells.\nInteractions with proteins.\nAll the functions of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These protein interactions can be non-specific, or the protein can bind specifically to a single DNA sequence. Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these, the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA replication are particularly important.\nDNA-binding proteins.\nStructural proteins that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA is held in complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called chromatin. In eukaryotes, this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called histones, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved. The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a nucleosome, which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface. These non-specific interactions are formed through basic residues in the histones, making ionic bonds to the acidic sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, and are thus largely independent of the base sequence. Chemical modifications of these basic amino acid residues include methylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation. These chemical changes alter the strength of the interaction between the DNA and the histones, making the DNA more or less accessible to transcription factors and changing the rate of transcription. Other non-specific DNA-binding proteins in chromatin include the high-mobility group proteins, which bind to bent or distorted DNA. These proteins are important in bending arrays of nucleosomes and arranging them into the larger structures that make up chromosomes.\nA distinct group of DNA-binding proteins is the DNA-binding proteins that specifically bind single-stranded DNA. In humans, replication protein A is the best-understood member of this family and is used in processes where the double helix is separated, including DNA replication, recombination, and DNA repair. These binding proteins seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and protect it from forming stem-loops or being degraded by nucleases.\nIn contrast, other proteins have evolved to bind to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various transcription factors, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription. Alternatively, transcription factors can bind enzymes that modify the histones at the promoter. This changes the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase.\nAs these DNA targets can occur throughout an organism's genome, changes in the activity of one type of transcription factor can affect thousands of genes. Consequently, these proteins are often the targets of the signal transduction processes that control responses to environmental changes or cellular differentiation and development. The specificity of these transcription factors' interactions with DNA come from the proteins making multiple contacts to the edges of the DNA bases, allowing them to \"read\" the DNA sequence. Most of these base-interactions are made in the major groove, where the bases are most accessible.\nDNA-modifying enzymes.\nNucleases and ligases.\nNucleases are enzymes that cut DNA strands by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bonds. Nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides from the ends of DNA strands are called exonucleases, while endonucleases cut within strands. The most frequently used nucleases in molecular biology are the restriction endonucleases, which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5\u2032-GATATC-3\u2032 and makes a cut at the horizontal line. In nature, these enzymes protect bacteria against phage infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the bacterial cell, acting as part of the restriction modification system. In technology, these sequence-specific nucleases are used in molecular cloning and DNA fingerprinting.\nEnzymes called DNA ligases can rejoin cut or broken DNA strands. Ligases are particularly important in lagging strand DNA replication, as they join the short segments of DNA produced at the replication fork into a complete copy of the DNA template. They are also used in DNA repair and genetic recombination.\nTopoisomerases and helicases.\nTopoisomerases are enzymes with both nuclease and ligase activity. These proteins change the amount of supercoiling in DNA. Some of these enzymes work by cutting the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break. Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand of DNA through this break, before rejoining the helix. Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication and transcription.\nHelicases are proteins that are a type of molecular motor. They use the chemical energy in nucleoside triphosphates, predominantly adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind the DNA double helix into single strands. These enzymes are essential for most processes where enzymes need to access the DNA bases.\nPolymerases.\nPolymerases are enzymes that synthesize polynucleotide chains from nucleoside triphosphates. The sequence of their products is created based on existing polynucleotide chains\u2014which are called \"templates\". These enzymes function by repeatedly adding a nucleotide to the 3\u2032 hydroxyl group at the end of the growing polynucleotide chain. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction. In the active site of these enzymes, the incoming nucleoside triphosphate base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize the complementary strand of their template. Polymerases are classified according to the type of template that they use.\nIn DNA replication, DNA-dependent DNA polymerases make copies of DNA polynucleotide chains. To preserve biological information, it is essential that the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a proofreading activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exonuclease activity is activated and the incorrect base removed. In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the replisome that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the DNA clamp or helicases.\nRNA-dependent DNA polymerases are a specialized class of polymerases that copy the sequence of an RNA strand into DNA. They include reverse transcriptase, which is a viral enzyme involved in the infection of cells by retroviruses, and telomerase, which is required for the replication of telomeres. For example, HIV reverse transcriptase is an enzyme for AIDS virus replication. Telomerase is an unusual polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure. It synthesizes telomeres at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres prevent fusion of the ends of neighboring chromosomes and protect chromosome ends from damage.\nTranscription is carried out by a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that copies the sequence of a DNA strand into RNA. To begin transcribing a gene, the RNA polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA strands. It then copies the gene sequence into a messenger RNA transcript until it reaches a region of DNA called the terminator, where it halts and detaches from the DNA. As with human DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, RNA polymerase II, the enzyme that transcribes most of the genes in the human genome, operates as part of a large protein complex with multiple regulatory and accessory subunits.\nGenetic recombination.\nStructure of the Holliday junction intermediate in genetic recombination. The four separate DNA strands are coloured red, blue, green and yellow.\nA DNA helix usually does not interact with other segments of DNA, and in human cells, the different chromosomes even occupy separate areas in the nucleus called \"chromosome territories\". This physical separation of different chromosomes is important for the ability of DNA to function as a stable repository for information, as one of the few times chromosomes interact is in chromosomal crossover which occurs during sexual reproduction, when genetic recombination occurs. Chromosomal crossover is when two DNA helices break, swap a section and then rejoin.\nRecombination allows chromosomes to exchange genetic information and produces new combinations of genes, which increases the efficiency of natural selection and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins. Genetic recombination can also be involved in DNA repair, particularly in the cell's response to double-strand breaks.\nThe most common form of chromosomal crossover is homologous recombination, where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. Non-homologous recombination can be damaging to cells, as it can produce chromosomal translocations and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as recombinases, such as RAD51. The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break caused by either an endonuclease or damage to the DNA. A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one Holliday junction, in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA. Only strands of like polarity exchange DNA during recombination. There are two types of cleavage: east-west cleavage and north\u2013south cleavage. The north\u2013south cleavage nicks both strands of DNA, while the east\u2013west cleavage has one strand of DNA intact. The formation of a Holliday junction during recombination makes it possible for genetic diversity, genes to exchange on chromosomes, and expression of wild-type viral genomes.\nEvolution.\nDNA contains the genetic information that allows all forms of life to function, grow and reproduce. However, it is unclear how long in the 4-billion-year history of life DNA has performed this function, as it has been proposed that the earliest forms of life may have used RNA as their genetic material. RNA may have acted as the central part of early cell metabolism as it can both transmit genetic information and carry out catalysis as part of ribozymes. This ancient RNA world where nucleic acid would have been used for both catalysis and genetics may have influenced the evolution of the current genetic code based on four nucleotide bases. This would occur, since the number of different bases in such an organism is a trade-off between a small number of bases increasing replication accuracy and a large number of bases increasing the catalytic efficiency of ribozymes. However, there is no direct evidence of ancient genetic systems, as recovery of DNA from most fossils is impossible because DNA survives in the environment for less than one million years, and slowly degrades into short fragments in solution. Claims for older DNA have been made, most notably a report of the isolation of a viable bacterium from a salt crystal 250 million years old, but these claims are controversial.\nBuilding blocks of DNA (adenine, guanine, and related organic molecules) may have been formed extraterrestrially in outer space. Complex DNA and RNA organic compounds of life, including uracil, cytosine, and thymine, have also been formed in the laboratory under conditions mimicking those found in outer space, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the universe, may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar cosmic dust and gas clouds.\nAncient DNA has been recovered from ancient organisms at a timescale where genome evolution can be directly observed, including from extinct organisms up to millions of years old, such as the woolly mammoth.\nUses in technology.\nGenetic engineering.\nMethods have been developed to purify DNA from organisms, such as phenol-chloroform extraction, and to manipulate it in the laboratory, such as restriction digests and the polymerase chain reaction. Modern biology and biochemistry make intensive use of these techniques in recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant DNA is a man-made DNA sequence that has been assembled from other DNA sequences. They can be transformed into organisms in the form of plasmids or in the appropriate format, by using a viral vector. The genetically modified organisms produced can be used to produce products such as recombinant proteins, used in medical research, or be grown in agriculture.\nDNA profiling.\nForensic scientists can use DNA in blood, semen, skin, saliva or hair found at a crime scene to identify a matching DNA of an individual, such as a perpetrator. This process is formally termed DNA profiling, also called \"DNA fingerprinting\". In DNA profiling, the lengths of variable sections of repetitive DNA, such as short tandem repeats and minisatellites, are compared between people. This method is usually an extremely reliable technique for identifying a matching DNA. However, identification can be complicated if the scene is contaminated with DNA from several people. DNA profiling was developed in 1984 by British geneticist Sir Alec Jeffreys, and first used in forensic science to convict Colin Pitchfork in the 1988 Enderby murders case.\nThe development of forensic science and the ability to now obtain genetic matching on minute samples of blood, skin, saliva, or hair has led to re-examining many cases. Evidence can now be uncovered that was scientifically impossible at the time of the original examination. Combined with the removal of the double jeopardy law in some places, this can allow cases to be reopened where prior trials have failed to produce sufficient evidence to convince a jury. People charged with serious crimes may be required to provide a sample of DNA for matching purposes. The most obvious defense to DNA matches obtained forensically is to claim that cross-contamination of evidence has occurred. This has resulted in meticulous strict handling procedures with new cases of serious crime.\nDNA profiling is also used successfully to positively identify victims of mass casualty incidents, bodies or body parts in serious accidents, and individual victims in mass war graves, via matching to family members.\nDNA profiling is also used in DNA paternity testing to determine if someone is the biological parent or grandparent of a child with the probability of parentage is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child. Normal DNA sequencing methods happen after birth, but there are new methods to test paternity while a mother is still pregnant.\nDNA enzymes or catalytic DNA.\nDeoxyribozymes, also called DNAzymes or catalytic DNA, were first discovered in 1994. They are mostly single stranded DNA sequences isolated from a large pool of random DNA sequences through a combinatorial approach called in vitro selection or systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). DNAzymes catalyze variety of chemical reactions including RNA-DNA cleavage, RNA-DNA ligation, amino acids phosphorylation-dephosphorylation, carbon-carbon bond formation, etc. DNAzymes can enhance catalytic rate of chemical reactions up to 100,000,000,000-fold over the uncatalyzed reaction. The most extensively studied class of DNAzymes is RNA-cleaving types which have been used to detect different metal ions and designing therapeutic agents. Several metal-specific DNAzymes have been reported including the GR-5 DNAzyme (lead-specific), the CA1-3 DNAzymes (copper-specific), the 39E DNAzyme (uranyl-specific) and the NaA43 DNAzyme (sodium-specific). The NaA43 DNAzyme, which is reported to be more than 10,000-fold selective for sodium over other metal ions, was used to make a real-time sodium sensor in cells.\nBioinformatics.\nBioinformatics involves the development of techniques to store, data mine, search and manipulate biological data, including DNA nucleic acid sequence data. These have led to widely applied advances in computer science, especially string searching algorithms, machine learning, and database theory. String searching or matching algorithms, which find an occurrence of a sequence of letters inside a larger sequence of letters, were developed to search for specific sequences of nucleotides. The DNA sequence may be aligned with other DNA sequences to identify homologous sequences and locate the specific mutations that make them distinct. These techniques, especially multiple sequence alignment, are used in studying phylogenetic relationships and protein function. Data sets representing entire genomes' worth of DNA sequences, such as those produced by the Human Genome Project, are difficult to use without the annotations that identify the locations of genes and regulatory elements on each chromosome. Regions of DNA sequence that have the characteristic patterns associated with protein- or RNA-coding genes can be identified by gene finding algorithms, which allow researchers to predict the presence of particular gene products and their possible functions in an organism even before they have been isolated experimentally. Entire genomes may also be compared, which can shed light on the evolutionary history of particular organism and permit the examination of complex evolutionary events.\nDNA nanotechnology.\nDNA nanotechnology uses the unique molecular recognition properties of DNA and other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties. DNA is thus used as a structural material rather than as a carrier of biological information. This has led to the creation of two-dimensional periodic lattices (both tile-based and using the \"DNA origami\" method) and three-dimensional structures in the shapes of polyhedra. Nanomechanical devices and algorithmic self-assembly have also been demonstrated, and these DNA structures have been used to template the arrangement of other molecules such as gold nanoparticles and streptavidin proteins. DNA and other nucleic acids are the basis of aptamers, synthetic oligonucleotide ligands for specific target molecules used in a range of biotechnology and biomedical applications.\nHistory and anthropology.\nBecause DNA collects mutations over time, which are then inherited, it contains historical information, and, by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can infer the evolutionary history of organisms, their phylogeny. This field of phylogenetics is a powerful tool in evolutionary biology. If DNA sequences within a species are compared, population geneticists can learn the history of particular populations. This can be used in studies ranging from ecological genetics to anthropology.\nInformation storage.\nDNA as a storage device for information has enormous potential since it has much higher storage density compared to electronic devices. However, high costs, slow read and write times (memory latency), and insufficient reliability has prevented its practical use.\nHistory.\nDNA was first isolated by the Swiss physician Friedrich Miescher who, in 1869, discovered a microscopic substance in the pus of discarded surgical bandages. As it resided in the nuclei of cells, he called it \"nuclein\". In 1878, Albrecht Kossel isolated the non-protein component of \"nuclein\", nucleic acid, and later isolated its five primary nucleobases.\nIn 1909, Phoebus Levene identified the base, sugar, and phosphate nucleotide unit of RNA (then named \"yeast nucleic acid\"). In 1929, Levene identified deoxyribose sugar in \"thymus nucleic acid\" (DNA). Levene suggested that DNA consisted of a string of four nucleotide units linked together through the phosphate groups (\"tetranucleotide hypothesis\"). Levene thought the chain was short and the bases repeated in a fixed order. In 1927, Nikolai Koltsov proposed that inherited traits would be inherited via a \"giant hereditary molecule\" made up of \"two mirror strands that would replicate in a semi-conservative fashion using each strand as a template\". In 1928, Frederick Griffith in his experiment discovered that traits of the \"smooth\" form of \"Pneumococcus\" could be transferred to the \"rough\" form of the same bacteria by mixing killed \"smooth\" bacteria with the live \"rough\" form. This system provided the first clear suggestion that DNA carries genetic information.\nIn 1933, while studying virgin sea urchin eggs, Jean Brachet suggested that DNA is found in the cell nucleus and that RNA is present exclusively in the cytoplasm. At the time, \"yeast nucleic acid\" (RNA) was thought to occur only in plants, while \"thymus nucleic acid\" (DNA) only in animals. The latter was thought to be a tetramer, with the function of buffering cellular pH.\nIn 1937, William Astbury produced the first X-ray diffraction patterns that showed that DNA had a regular structure.\nIn 1943, Oswald Avery, along with co-workers Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty, identified DNA as the transforming principle, supporting Griffith's suggestion (Avery\u2013MacLeod\u2013McCarty experiment). Erwin Chargaff developed and published observations now known as Chargaff's rules, stating that in DNA from any species of any organism, the amount of guanine should be equal to cytosine and the amount of adenine should be equal to thymine. \nLate in 1951, Francis Crick started working with James Watson at the Cavendish Laboratory within the University of Cambridge. DNA's role in heredity was confirmed in 1952 when Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase in the Hershey\u2013Chase experiment showed that DNA is the genetic material of the enterobacteria phage T2.\nIn May 1952, Raymond Gosling, a graduate student working under the supervision of Rosalind Franklin, took an X-ray diffraction image, labeled as \"Photo 51\", at high hydration levels of DNA. This photo was given to Watson and Crick by Maurice Wilkins and was critical to their obtaining the correct structure of DNA. Franklin told Crick and Watson that the backbones had to be on the outside. Before then, Linus Pauling, and Watson and Crick, had erroneous models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards. Franklin's identification of the space group for DNA crystals revealed to Crick that the two DNA strands were antiparallel. In February 1953, Linus Pauling and Robert Corey proposed a model for nucleic acids containing three intertwined chains, with the phosphates near the axis, and the bases on the outside. Watson and Crick completed their model, which is now accepted as the first correct model of the double helix of DNA. On 28 February 1953 Crick interrupted patrons' lunchtime at The Eagle pub in Cambridge, England to announce that he and Watson had \"discovered the secret of life\".\nThe 25 April 1953 issue of the journal \"Nature\" published a series of five articles giving the Watson and Crick double-helix structure DNA and evidence supporting it. The structure was reported in a letter titled \"\"MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF NUCLEIC ACIDS A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid\", in which they said, \"It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.\" This letter was followed by a letter from Franklin and Gosling, which was the first publication of their own X-ray diffraction data and of their original analysis method. Then followed a letter by Wilkins and two of his colleagues, which contained an analysis of \"in vivo\" B-DNA X-ray patterns, and which supported the presence \"in vivo\" of the Watson and Crick structure.\nIn April 2023, scientists, based on new evidence, concluded that Rosalind Franklin was a contributor and \"equal player\" in the discovery process of DNA, rather than otherwise, as may have been presented subsequently after the time of the discovery.\nIn 1962, after Franklin's death, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins jointly received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Nobel Prizes are awarded only to living recipients. A debate continues about who should receive credit for the discovery.\nIn an influential presentation in 1957, Crick laid out the central dogma of molecular biology, which foretold the relationship between DNA, RNA, and proteins, and articulated the \"adaptor hypothesis\". Final confirmation of the replication mechanism that was implied by the double-helical structure followed in 1958 through the Meselson\u2013Stahl experiment. Further work by Crick and co-workers showed that the genetic code was based on non-overlapping triplets of bases, called codons, allowing Har Gobind Khorana, Robert W. Holley, and Marshall Warren Nirenberg to decipher the genetic code. These findings represent the birth of molecular biology.\nIn 1986, DNA analysis was first used for criminal investigative purposes when police in the UK requested Alec Jeffreys of the University of Leicester to verify or disprove a suspect's rape-murder \"confession\". In this particular case, the suspect had confessed to two rape-murders, but had later retracted his confession. DNA testing at the university labs soon disproved the veracity of the suspect's original \"confession\", and the suspect was exonerated from the murder-rape charges."}
