There is no scientific consensus on a definition. Emotions are often intertwined with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, or creativity.\nResearch on emotion has increased over the past two decades, with many fields contributing, including psychology, medicine, history, sociology of emotions, computer science and philosophy. The numerous attempts to explain the origin, function, and other aspects of emotions have fostered intense research on this topic. Theorizing about the evolutionary origin and possible purpose of emotion dates back to Charles Darwin. Current areas of research include the neuroscience of emotion, using tools like PET and fMRI scans to study the affective picture processes in the brain.\nFrom a mechanistic perspective, emotions can be defined as \"a positive or negative experience that is associated with a particular pattern of physiological activity\". Emotions are complex, involving multiple different components, such as subjective experience, cognitive processes, expressive behavior, psychophysiological changes, and instrumental behavior. At one time, academics attempted to identify the emotion with one of the components: William James with a subjective experience, behaviorists with instrumental behavior, psychophysiologists with physiological changes, and so on. More recently, emotion has been said to consist of all the components. The different components of emotion are categorized somewhat differently depending on the academic discipline. In psychology and philosophy, emotion typically includes a subjective, conscious experience characterized primarily by psychophysiological expressions, biological reactions, and mental states. A similar multi-componential description of emotion is found in sociology. For example, Peggy Thoits described emotions as involving physiological components, cultural or emotional labels (anger, surprise, etc.), expressive body actions, and the appraisal of situations and contexts. Cognitive processes, like reasoning and decision-making, are often regarded as separate from emotional processes, making a division between \"thinking\" and \"feeling\". However, not all theories of emotion regard this separation as valid.\nNowadays, most research into emotions in the clinical and well-being context focuses on emotion dynamics in daily life, predominantly the intensity of specific emotions and their variability, instability, inertia, and differentiation, as well as whether and how emotions augment or blunt each other over time and differences in these dynamics between people and along the lifespan.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"emotion\" dates back to 1579, when it was adapted from the French word \"\u00e9mouvoir\", which means \"to stir up\". The term emotion was introduced into academic discussion as a catch-all term to passions, sentiments and affections. The word \"emotion\" was coined in the early 1800s by Thomas Brown and it is around the 1830s that the modern concept of emotion first emerged for the English language. \"No one felt emotions before about 1830. Instead they felt other things \u2013 'passions', 'accidents of the soul', 'moral sentiments' \u2013 and explained them very differently from how we understand emotions today.\"\nSome cross-cultural studies indicate that the categorization of \"emotion\" and classification of basic emotions such as \"anger\" and \"sadness\" are not universal and that the boundaries and domains of these concepts are categorized differently by all cultures. However, others argue that there are some universal bases of emotions (see Section 6.1). In psychiatry and psychology, an inability to express or perceive emotion is sometimes referred to as alexithymia.\nHistory.\nHuman nature and the accompanying bodily sensations have always been part of the interests of thinkers and philosophers. Far more extensively, this has also been of great interest to both Western and Eastern societies. Emotional states have been associated with the divine and with the enlightenment of the human mind and body. The ever-changing actions of individuals and their mood variations have been of great importance to most of the Western philosophers (including Aristotle, Plato, Descartes, Aquinas, and Hobbes), leading them to propose extensive theories\u2014often competing theories\u2014that sought to explain emotion and the accompanying motivators of human action, as well as its consequences.\nIn the Age of Enlightenment, Scottish thinker David Hume proposed a revolutionary argument that sought to explain the main motivators of human action and conduct. He proposed that actions are motivated by \"fears, desires, and passions\". As he wrote in his book \"A Treatise of Human Nature\" (1773): \"Reason alone can never be a motive to any action of the will\u2026 it can never oppose passion in the direction of the will\u2026 The reason is, and ought to be, the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them\". With these lines, Hume attempted to explain that reason and further action would be subject to the desires and experience of the self. Later thinkers would propose that actions and emotions are deeply interrelated with social, political, historical, and cultural aspects of reality that would also come to be associated with sophisticated neurological and physiological research on the brain and other parts of the physical body.\nDefinitions.\nThe Lexico definition of emotion is \"A strong feeling deriving from one's circumstances, mood, or relationships with others\". Emotions are responses to significant internal and external events.\nEmotions can be occurrences (e.g., panic) or dispositions (e.g., hostility), and short-lived (e.g., anger) or long-lived (e.g., grief). Psychotherapist Michael C. Graham describes all emotions as existing on a continuum of intensity. Thus fear might range from mild concern to terror or shame might range from simple embarrassment to toxic shame. Emotions have been described as consisting of a coordinated set of responses, which may include verbal, physiological, behavioral, and neural mechanisms.\nEmotions have been categorized, with some relationships existing between emotions and some direct opposites existing. Graham differentiates emotions as functional or dysfunctional and argues all functional emotions have benefits.\nIn some uses of the word, emotions are intense feelings that are directed at someone or something. On the other hand, emotion can be used to refer to states that are mild (as in annoyed or content) and to states that are not directed at anything (as in anxiety and depression). One line of research looks at the meaning of the word emotion in everyday language and finds that this usage is rather different from that in academic discourse.\nIn practical terms, Joseph LeDoux has defined emotions as the result of a cognitive and conscious process which occurs in response to a body system response to a trigger.\nComponents.\nAccording to Scherer's Component Process Model (CPM) of emotion, there are five crucial elements of emotion. From the component process perspective, emotional experience requires that all of these processes become coordinated and synchronized for a short period of time, driven by appraisal processes. Although the inclusion of cognitive appraisal as one of the elements is slightly controversial, since some theorists make the assumption that emotion and cognition are separate but interacting systems, the CPM provides a sequence of events that effectively describes the coordination involved during an emotional episode.\nDifferentiation.\nEmotion can be differentiated from a number of similar constructs within the field of affective neuroscience:\nEvolutionary approach: Emotions' purpose and value.\nThere is no single, universally accepted evolutionary theory. The most prominent ideas suggest that emotions have evolved to serve various adaptive functions:\nClassification.\nA distinction can be made between emotional episodes and emotional dispositions. Emotional dispositions are also comparable to character traits, where someone may be said to be generally disposed to experience certain emotions. For example, an irritable person is generally disposed to feel irritation more easily or quickly than others do. Finally, some theorists place emotions within a more general category of \"affective states\" where affective states can also include emotion-related phenomena such as pleasure and pain, motivational states (for example, hunger or curiosity), moods, dispositions and traits.\nBasic emotions theory.\nFor more than 40 years, Paul Ekman has supported the view that emotions are discrete, measurable, and physiologically distinct. Ekman's most influential work revolved around the finding that certain emotions appeared to be universally recognized, even in cultures that were preliterate and could not have learned associations for facial expressions through media. Another classic study found that when participants contorted their facial muscles into distinct facial expressions (for example, disgust), they reported subjective and physiological experiences that matched the distinct facial expressions. Ekman's facial-expression research examined six basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise.\nLater in his career, Ekman theorized that other universal emotions may exist beyond these six. In light of this, recent cross-cultural studies led by Daniel Cordaro and Dacher Keltner, both former students of Ekman, extended the list of universal emotions. In addition to the original six, these studies provided evidence for amusement, awe, contentment, desire, embarrassment, pain, relief, and sympathy in both facial and vocal expressions. They also found evidence for boredom, confusion, interest, pride, and shame facial expressions, as well as contempt, relief, and triumph vocal expressions.\nRobert Plutchik agreed with Ekman's biologically driven perspective but developed the \"wheel of emotions\", suggesting eight primary emotions grouped on a positive or negative basis: joy versus sadness; anger versus fear; trust versus disgust; and surprise versus anticipation. Some basic emotions can be modified to form complex emotions. The complex emotions could arise from cultural conditioning or association combined with the basic emotions. Alternatively, similar to the way primary colors combine, \"primary emotions\" could blend to form the full spectrum of human emotional experience. For example, interpersonal anger and disgust could blend to form contempt. Relationships exist between basic emotions, resulting in positive or negative influences.\nJaak Panksepp carved out seven biologically inherited primary affective systems called SEEKING (expectancy), FEAR (anxiety), RAGE (anger), LUST (sexual excitement), CARE (nurturance), PANIC/GRIEF (sadness), and PLAY (social joy). He proposed what is known as \"core-SELF\" to be generating these affects.\nMulti-dimensional analysis theory.\nPsychologists have used methods such as factor analysis to attempt to map emotion-related responses onto a more limited number of dimensions. Such methods attempt to boil emotions down to underlying dimensions that capture the similarities and differences between experiences. Often, the first two dimensions uncovered by factor analysis are valence (how negative or positive the experience feels) and arousal (how energized or enervated the experience feels). These two dimensions can be depicted on a 2D coordinate map. This two-dimensional map has been theorized to capture one important component of emotion called core affect. Core affect is not theorized to be the only component to emotion, but to give the emotion its hedonic and felt energy.\nUsing statistical methods to analyze emotional states elicited by short videos, Cowen and Keltner identified 27 varieties of emotional experience: admiration, adoration, aesthetic appreciation, amusement, anger, anxiety, awe, awkwardness, boredom, calmness, confusion, craving, disgust, empathic pain, entrancement, excitement, fear, horror, interest, joy, nostalgia, relief, romance, sadness, satisfaction, sexual desire, and surprise.\nTheories.\nPre-modern history.\nIn Hinduism, Bharata Muni enunciated the nine rasas (emotions) in the \"N\u0101tyas\u0101stra\", an ancient Sanskrit text of dramatic theory and other performance arts, written between 200 BC and 200 AD. The theory of rasas still forms the aesthetic underpinning of all Indian classical dance and theatre, such as Bharatanatyam, kathak, Kuchipudi, Odissi, Manipuri, Kudiyattam, Kathakali and others. Bharata Muni established the following: \u015a\u1e5b\u1e45g\u0101ra\u1e25 (\u0936\u0943\u0919\u094d\u0917\u093e\u0930\u0903): Romance / Love / attractiveness, H\u0101syam (\u0939\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092f\u0902): Laughter / mirth / comedy, Raudram (\u0930\u094c\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0902): Fury / Anger, K\u0101ru\u1e47yam (\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0941\u0923\u094d\u092f\u0902): Compassion / mercy, B\u012bbhatsam (\u092c\u0940\u092d\u0924\u094d\u0938\u0902): Disgust / aversion, Bhay\u0101nakam (\u092d\u092f\u093e\u0928\u0915\u0902): Horror / terror, Veeram (\u0935\u0940\u0930\u0902): Pride / Heroism, Adbhutam (\u0905\u0926\u094d\u092d\u0941\u0924\u0902): Surprise / wonder.\nIn Buddhism, emotions occur when an object is considered attractive or repulsive. There is a felt tendency impelling people towards attractive objects and propelling them to move away from repulsive or harmful objects; a disposition to possess the object (greed), to destroy it (hatred), to flee from it (fear), to get obsessed or worried over it (anxiety), and so on.\nIn Stoic theories, normal emotions (like delight and fear) are described as irrational impulses that come from incorrect appraisals of what is 'good' or 'bad'. Alternatively, there are 'good emotions' (like joy and caution) experienced by those that are wise, which come from correct appraisals of what is 'good' and 'bad'.\nAristotle believed that emotions were an essential component of virtue. In the Aristotelian view all emotions (called passions) corresponded to appetites or capacities. During the Middle Ages, the Aristotelian view was adopted and further developed by scholasticism and Thomas Aquinas in particular.\nIn Chinese antiquity, excessive emotion was believed to cause damage to \"qi\", which in turn, damages the vital organs. The four humors theory made popular by Hippocrates contributed to the study of emotion in the same way that it did for medicine.\nIn the early 11th century, Avicenna theorized about the influence of emotions on health and behaviors, suggesting the need to manage emotions.\nEarly modern views on emotion are developed in the works of philosophers such as Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, Baruch Spinoza, Thomas Hobbes and David Hume. In the 19th century emotions were considered adaptive and were studied more frequently from an empiricist psychiatric perspective.\nWestern theological.\nChristian perspective on emotion presupposes a theistic origin to humanity. God who created humans gave humans the ability to feel emotion and interact emotionally. Biblical content expresses that God is a person who feels and expresses emotion. Though a somatic view would place the locus of emotions in the physical body, Christian theory of emotions would view the body more as a platform for the sensing and expression of emotions. Therefore, emotions themselves arise from the person, or that which is \"imago-dei\" or Image of God in humans. In Christian thought, emotions have the potential to be controlled through reasoned reflection. That reasoned reflection also mimics God who made mind. The purpose of emotions in human life is therefore summarized in God's call to enjoy Him and creation, humans are to enjoy emotions and benefit from them and use them to energize behavior.\nEvolutionary theories.\n19th century.\nPerspectives on emotions from evolutionary theory were initiated during the mid-late 19th century with Charles Darwin's 1872 book \"The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals\". Darwin argued that emotions served no evolved purpose for humans, neither in communication, nor in aiding survival. Darwin largely argued that emotions evolved via the inheritance of acquired characters. He pioneered various methods for studying non-verbal expressions, from which he concluded that some expressions had cross-cultural universality. Darwin also detailed homologous expressions of emotions that occur in animals. This led the way for animal research on emotions and the eventual determination of the neural underpinnings of emotion.\nContemporary.\nMore contemporary views along the evolutionary psychology spectrum posit that both basic emotions and social emotions evolved to motivate (social) behaviors that were adaptive in the ancestral environment. Emotion is an essential part of any human decision-making and planning, and the famous distinction made between reason and emotion is not as clear as it seems. Paul D. MacLean claims that emotion competes with even more instinctive responses, on one hand, and the more abstract reasoning, on the other hand. The increased potential in neuroimaging has also allowed investigation into evolutionarily ancient parts of the brain. Important neurological advances were derived from these perspectives in the 1990s by Joseph E. LeDoux and Antonio Damasio. For example, in an extensive study of a subject with ventromedial frontal lobe damage described in the book Descartes' Error, Damasio demonstrated how loss of physiological capacity for emotion resulted in the subject's lost capacity to make decisions despite having robust faculties for rationally assessing options. Research on physiological emotion has caused modern neuroscience to abandon the model of emotions and rationality as opposing forces. In contrast to the ancient Greek ideal of dispassionate reason, the neuroscience of emotion shows that emotion is necessarily integrated with intellect.\nResearch on social emotion also focuses on the physical displays of emotion including body language of animals and humans (see affect display). For example, spite seems to work against the individual but it can establish an individual's reputation as someone to be feared. Shame and pride can motivate behaviors that help one maintain one's standing in a community, and self-esteem is one's estimate of one's status.\nSomatic theories.\nSomatic theories of emotion claim that bodily responses, rather than cognitive interpretations, are essential to emotions. The first modern version of such theories came from William James in the 1880s. The theory lost favor in the 20th century, but has regained popularity more recently due largely to theorists such as John T. Cacioppo, Antonio Damasio, Joseph E. LeDoux and Robert Zajonc who are able to appeal to neurological evidence.\nJames\u2013Lange theory.\nIn his 1884 article William James argued that feelings and emotions were \"secondary\" to physiological phenomena. In his theory, James proposed that the perception of what he called an \"exciting fact\" directly led to a physiological response, known as \"emotion\". To account for different types of emotional experiences, James proposed that stimuli trigger activity in the autonomic nervous system, which in turn produces an emotional experience in the brain. The Danish psychologist Carl Lange also proposed a similar theory at around the same time, and therefore this theory became known as the James\u2013Lange theory. As James wrote, \"the perception of bodily changes, as they occur, \"is\" the emotion\". James further claims that \"we feel sad because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble, and either we cry, strike, or tremble because we are sorry, angry, or fearful, as the case may be\".\nAn example of this theory in action would be as follows: An emotion-evoking stimulus (snake) triggers a pattern of physiological response (increased heart rate, faster breathing, etc.), which is interpreted as a particular emotion (fear). This theory is supported by experiments in which by manipulating the bodily state induces a desired emotional state. Some people may believe that emotions give rise to emotion-specific actions, for example, \"I'm crying because I'm sad\", or \"I ran away because I was scared\". The issue with the James\u2013Lange theory is that of causation (bodily states causing emotions and being \"a priori\"), not that of the bodily influences on emotional experience (which can be argued and is still quite prevalent today in biofeedback studies and embodiment theory).\nAlthough mostly abandoned in its original form, Tim Dalgleish argues that most contemporary neuroscientists have embraced the components of the James-Lange theory of emotions.\nCannon\u2013Bard theory.\nWalter Bradford Cannon agreed that physiological responses played a crucial role in emotions, but did not believe that physiological responses alone could explain subjective emotional experiences. He argued that physiological responses were too slow and often imperceptible and this could not account for the relatively rapid and intense subjective awareness of emotion. He also believed that the richness, variety, and temporal course of emotional experiences could not stem from physiological reactions, that reflected fairly undifferentiated fight or flight responses. An example of this theory in action is as follows: An emotion-evoking event (snake) triggers simultaneously both a physiological response and a conscious experience of an emotion.\nPhillip Bard contributed to the theory with his work on animals. Bard found that sensory, motor, and physiological information all had to pass through the diencephalon (particularly the thalamus), before being subjected to any further processing. Therefore, Cannon also argued that it was not anatomically possible for sensory events to trigger a physiological response prior to triggering conscious awareness and emotional stimuli had to trigger both physiological and experiential aspects of emotion simultaneously.\nTwo-factor theory.\nStanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Mara\u00f1\u00f3n found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion. Hence, the combination of the appraisal of the situation (cognitive) and the participants' reception of adrenalin or a placebo together determined the response. This experiment has been criticized in Jesse Prinz's (2004) \"Gut Reactions\".\nCognitive theories.\nWith the two-factor theory now incorporating cognition, several theories began to argue that cognitive activity in the form of judgments, evaluations, or thoughts were entirely necessary for an emotion to occur.\nCognitive theories of emotion emphasize that emotions are shaped by how individuals interpret and appraise situations. These theories highlight:\nThese theories acknowledge that emotions are not automatic reactions but result from the interplay of cognitive interpretations, physiological responses, and the social context. A prominent philosophical exponent is Robert C. Solomon (for example, \"The Passions, Emotions and the Meaning of Life\", 1993). Solomon claims that emotions are judgments. He has put forward a more nuanced view which responds to what he has called the 'standard objection' to cognitivism, the idea that a judgment that something is fearsome can occur with or without emotion, so judgment cannot be identified with emotion.\nCognitive Appraisal Theory.\nOne of the main proponents of this view was Richard Lazarus who argued that emotions must have some cognitive intentionality. The cognitive activity involved in the interpretation of an emotional context may be conscious or unconscious and may or may not take the form of conceptual processing.\nLazarus' theory is very influential; emotion is a disturbance that occurs in the following order:\nFor example: Jenny sees a snake.\nLazarus stressed that the quality and intensity of emotions are controlled through cognitive processes. These processes underline coping strategies that form the emotional reaction by altering the relationship between the person and the environment.\nTwo-Process Theory.\nGeorge Mandler provided an extensive theoretical and empirical discussion of emotion as influenced by cognition, consciousness, and the autonomic nervous system in two books (\"Mind and Emotion\", 1975, and \"Mind and Body: Psychology of Emotion and Stress\", 1984)\nGeorge Mandler, a prominent psychologist known for his contributions to the study of cognition and emotion, proposed the \"Two-Process Theory of Emotion\". This theory offers insights into how emotions are generated and how cognitive processes play a role in emotional experiences. Mandler's theory focuses on the interplay between primary and secondary appraisal processes in the formation of emotions. Here are the key components of his theory:\nMandler's Two-Process Theory of Emotion emphasizes the importance of cognitive appraisal processes in shaping emotional experiences. It recognizes that emotions are not just automatic reactions but result from complex evaluations of the significance of situations and one's ability to manage them effectively. This theory underscores the role of cognition in the emotional process and highlights the interplay of cognitive factors in the formation of emotions.\nThe Affect Infusion Model (AIM).\nThe Affect Infusion Model (AIM) is a psychological framework that was developed by Joseph Forgas in the 1990s. This model focuses on how affect, or mood and emotions, can influence cognitive processes and decision-making. The central idea of the AIM is that affect, whether it is a positive or negative mood, can \"infuse\" or influence various cognitive activities, including information processing and judgments.\nKey components and principles of the Affect Infusion Model include:\nThe Affect Infusion Model has been applied to a wide range of areas, including consumer behavior, social judgment, and interpersonal interactions. It emphasizes the idea that emotions and mood play a more significant role in cognitive processes and decision-making than traditionally thought. While it has been influential in understanding the interplay between affect and cognition, it is important to note that the AIM is just one of several models in the field of emotion and cognition that help explain the intricate relationship between emotions and thinking.\nAppraisal-Tendency Theory.\nSource:\nThe Appraisal-Tendency Theory, developed by Joseph P. Forgas, is a theory that focuses on how people have dispositional tendencies to appraise and interpret situations in specific ways, leading to consistent emotional reactions to particular types of situations. This theory suggests that certain individuals may have stable, habitual patterns of appraising and attributing emotional significance to events, and these tendencies can influence their emotional responses and judgments.\nKey features and concepts of the Appraisal-Tendency Theory include:\nAppraisal-Tendency Theory suggests that these cognitive tendencies can shape an individual's overall emotional disposition, influencing their emotional reactions and social judgments. This theory has been applied in various contexts, including studies of personality, social psychology, and decision-making, to better understand how cognitive appraisal tendencies influence emotional and evaluative responses.\nLaws of Emotion.\nSource:\nNico Frijda was a prominent psychologist known for his work in the field of emotion and affective science. One of the key contributions of Frijda are his \"Laws of Emotion\", which outline a set of principles that help explain how emotions function and how they are experienced. Frijda's Laws of Emotion are as follows:\nFrijda's theory emphasizes the adaptive function of emotions and the role of cognitive appraisal in shaping emotional experiences. It highlights that emotions are not simply reactions to external events but are intimately tied to the individual's goals, values, and perceptions of the situation's meaning. Frijda's work has had a significant influence on the study of emotions and has contributed to a more comprehensive understanding of how emotions operate.\nEmotion Attribution Theory.\nSource:\nJesse Prinz is a contemporary philosopher and cognitive scientist who has contributed to the field of emotion theory. One of his influential theories is the \"Emotion Attribution Theory\", which provides a perspective on how people recognize and understand emotions in themselves and others.\nEmotion Attribution Theory, proposed by Jesse Prinz, focuses on the role of emotion attributions in the experience and understanding of emotions. Key ideas and components of Prinz's theory include:\nOverall, Prinz's Emotion Attribution Theory emphasizes the role of attributions in the recognition and understanding of emotions. It highlights the automatic and cognitive processes involved in identifying and interpreting emotional states in oneself and others. This theory has implications for fields such as psychology, philosophy, and cognitive science and contributes to our understanding of the social and cultural aspects of emotions.\nAffective Events Theory (AET).\nSource:\nThe Affective Events Theory (AET) is a psychological theory that focuses on the role of workplace events in shaping employees' emotions, attitudes, and behaviors in the context of their job. This theory was developed by organizational psychologists Howard M. Weiss and Russell Cropanzano in the late 1990s. AET primarily concerns itself with how emotional experiences at work can impact job satisfaction, performance, and other outcomes.\nKey concepts and principles of the Affective Events Theory include:\nAET has been influential in the field of organizational psychology and has helped shed light on how workplace events can have a significant impact on employee well-being and organizational outcomes. It highlights the importance of understanding and managing the emotional experiences of employees in the context of their work.\nSituated perspective on emotion.\nA situated perspective on emotion, developed by Paul E. Griffiths and Andrea Scarantino, emphasizes the importance of external factors in the development and communication of emotion, drawing upon the situationism approach in psychology. This theory is markedly different from both cognitivist and neo-Jamesian theories of emotion, both of which see emotion as a purely internal process, with the environment only acting as a stimulus to the emotion. In contrast, a situationist perspective on emotion views emotion as the product of an organism investigating its environment, and observing the responses of other organisms. Emotion stimulates the evolution of social relationships, acting as a signal to mediate the behavior of other organisms. In some contexts, the expression of emotion (both voluntary and involuntary) could be seen as strategic moves in the transactions between different organisms. The situated perspective on emotion states that conceptual thought is not an inherent part of emotion, since emotion is an action-oriented form of skillful engagement with the world. Griffiths and Scarantino suggested that this perspective on emotion could be helpful in understanding phobias, as well as the emotions of infants and animals.\nGenetics.\nEmotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems. These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring.\nIn the five million years since the lineages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified. This suggests that everything that separates us from chimpanzees must be encoded in that very small amount of DNA, including our behaviors. Students that study animal behaviors have only identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. In voles (Microtus spp.) minor genetic differences have been identified in a vasopressin receptor gene that corresponds to major species differences in social organization and the mating system. Another potential example with behavioral differences is the FOXP2 gene, which is involved in neural circuitry handling speech and language. Its present form in humans differed from that of the chimpanzees by only a few mutations and has been present for about 200,000 years, coinciding with the beginning of modern humans. Speech, language, and social organization are all part of the basis for emotions.\nFormation.\nNeurobiological explanation.\nBased on discoveries made through neural mapping of the limbic system, the neurobiological explanation of human emotion is that emotion is a pleasant or unpleasant mental state organized in the limbic system of the mammalian brain. If distinguished from reactive responses of reptiles, emotions would then be mammalian elaborations of general vertebrate arousal patterns, in which neurochemicals (for example, dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin) step-up or step-down the brain's activity level, as visible in body movements, gestures and postures. Emotions can likely be mediated by pheromones (see fear).\nFor example, the emotion of love is proposed to be the expression of Paleocircuits of the mammalian brain (specifically, modules of the cingulate cortex (or gyrus)) which facilitate the care, feeding, and grooming of offspring. Paleocircuits are neural platforms for bodily expression configured before the advent of cortical circuits for speech. They consist of pre-configured pathways or networks of nerve cells in the forebrain, brainstem and spinal cord.\nOther emotions like fear and anxiety long thought to be exclusively generated by the most primitive parts of the brain (stem) and more associated to the fight-or-flight responses of behavior, have also been associated as adaptive expressions of defensive behavior whenever a threat is encountered. Although defensive behaviors have been present in a wide variety of species, Blanchard et al. (2001) discovered a correlation of given stimuli and situation that resulted in a similar pattern of defensive behavior towards a threat in human and non-human mammals.\nWhenever potentially dangerous stimuli are presented, additional brain structures activate that previous thought (hippocampus, thalamus, etc.). Thus, giving the amygdala an important role in coordinating the following behavioral input based on the presented neurotransmitters that respond to threat stimuli. These biological functions of the amygdala are not only limited to the \"fear-conditioning\" and \"processing of aversive stimuli\", but also are present on other components of the amygdala. Therefore, it can referred the amygdala as a key structure to understand the potential responses of behavior in danger like situations in human and non-human mammals.\nThe motor centers of reptiles react to sensory cues of vision, sound, touch, chemical, gravity, and motion with pre-set body movements and programmed postures. With the arrival of night-active mammals, smell replaced vision as the dominant sense, and a different way of responding arose from the olfactory sense, which is proposed to have developed into mammalian emotion and emotional memory. The mammalian brain invested heavily in olfaction to succeed at night as reptiles slept \u2013 one explanation for why olfactory lobes in mammalian brains are proportionally larger than in the reptiles. These odor pathways gradually formed the neural blueprint for what was later to become our limbic brain.\nEmotions are thought to be related to certain activities in brain areas that direct our attention, motivate our behavior, and determine the significance of what is going on around us. Pioneering work by Paul Broca (1878), James Papez (1937), and Paul D. MacLean (1952) suggested that emotion is related to a group of structures in the center of the brain called the limbic system, which includes the hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, hippocampi, and other structures. More recent research has shown that some of these limbic structures are not as directly related to emotion as others are while some non-limbic structures have been found to be of greater emotional relevance.\nPrefrontal cortex.\nThere is ample evidence that the left prefrontal cortex is activated by stimuli that cause positive approach. If attractive stimuli can selectively activate a region of the brain, then logically the converse should hold, that selective activation of that region of the brain should cause a stimulus to be judged more positively. This was demonstrated for moderately attractive visual stimuli and replicated and extended to include negative stimuli.\nTwo neurobiological models of emotion in the prefrontal cortex made opposing predictions. The valence model predicted that anger, a negative emotion, would activate the right prefrontal cortex. The direction model predicted that anger, an approach emotion, would activate the left prefrontal cortex. The second model was supported.\nThis still left open the question of whether the opposite of approach in the prefrontal cortex is better described as moving away (direction model), as unmoving but with strength and resistance (movement model), or as unmoving with passive yielding (action tendency model). Support for the action tendency model (passivity related to right prefrontal activity) comes from research on shyness and research on behavioral inhibition. Research that tested the competing hypotheses generated by all four models also supported the action tendency model.\nHomeostatic/primordial emotion.\nAnother neurological approach proposed by Bud Craig in 2003 distinguishes two classes of emotion: \"classical\" emotions such as love, anger and fear that are evoked by environmental stimuli, and \"homeostatic emotions\"attention-demanding feelings evoked by body states, such as pain, hunger and fatigue, that motivate behavior (withdrawal, eating or resting in these examples) aimed at maintaining the body's internal milieu at its ideal state.\nDerek Denton calls the latter \"primordial emotions\" and defines them as \"the subjective element of the instincts, which are the genetically programmed behavior patterns which contrive homeostasis. They include thirst, hunger for air, hunger for food, pain and hunger for specific minerals etc. There are two constituents of a primordial emotion \u2013 the specific sensation which when severe may be imperious, and the compelling intention for gratification by a consummatory act\".\nEmergent explanation.\nEmotions are seen by some researchers to be constructed (emerge) in social and cognitive domain alone, without directly implying biologically inherited characteristics.\nJoseph LeDoux differentiates between the human's defense system, which has evolved over time, and emotions such as fear and anxiety. He has said that the amygdala may release hormones due to a trigger (such as an innate reaction to seeing a snake), but \"then we elaborate it through cognitive and conscious processes\".\nLisa Feldman Barrett highlights differences in emotions between different cultures, and says that emotions (such as anxiety) are socially constructed (see theory of constructed emotion). She says that they \"are not triggered; you create them. They emerge as a combination of the physical properties of your body, a flexible brain that wires itself to whatever environment it develops in, and your culture and upbringing, which provide that environment\". She has termed this approach the theory of constructed emotion.\nDisciplinary approaches.\nMany different disciplines have produced work on the emotions. Human sciences study the role of emotions in mental processes, disorders, and neural mechanisms. In psychiatry, emotions are examined as part of the discipline's study and treatment of mental disorders in humans. Nursing studies emotions as part of its approach to the provision of holistic health care to humans. Psychology examines emotions from a scientific perspective by treating them as mental processes and behavior and they explore the underlying physiological and neurological processes, e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy. In neuroscience sub-fields such as social neuroscience and affective neuroscience, scientists study the neural mechanisms of emotion by combining neuroscience with the psychological study of personality, emotion, and mood. In linguistics, the expression of emotion may change to the meaning of sounds. In education, the role of emotions in relation to learning is examined.\nSocial sciences often examine emotion for the role that it plays in human culture and social interactions. In sociology, emotions are examined for the role they play in human society, social patterns and interactions, and culture. In anthropology, the study of humanity, scholars use ethnography to undertake contextual analyzes and cross-cultural comparisons of a range of human activities. Some anthropology studies examine the role of emotions in human activities. In the field of communication studies, critical organizational scholars have examined the role of emotions in organizations, from the perspectives of managers, employees, and even customers. A focus on emotions in organizations can be credited to Arlie Russell Hochschild's concept of emotional labor. The University of Queensland hosts EmoNet, an e-mail distribution list representing a network of academics that facilitates scholarly discussion of all matters relating to the study of emotion in organizational settings. The list was established in January 1997 and has over 700 members from across the globe.\nIn economics, the social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, emotions are analyzed in some sub-fields of microeconomics, in order to assess the role of emotions on purchase decision-making and risk perception. In criminology, a social science approach to the study of crime, scholars often draw on behavioral sciences, sociology, and psychology; emotions are examined in criminology issues such as anomie theory and studies of \"toughness\", aggressive behavior, and hooliganism. In law, which underpins civil obedience, politics, economics and society, evidence about people's emotions is often raised in tort law claims for compensation and in criminal law prosecutions against alleged lawbreakers (as evidence of the defendant's state of mind during trials, sentencing, and parole hearings). In political science, emotions are examined in a number of sub-fields, such as the analysis of voter decision-making.\nIn philosophy, emotions are studied in sub-fields such as ethics, the philosophy of art (for example, sensory\u2013emotional values, and matters of taste and sentimentality), and the philosophy of music (see also music and emotion). In history, scholars examine documents and other sources to interpret and analyze past activities; speculation on the emotional state of the authors of historical documents is one of the tools of interpretation. In literature and film-making, the expression of emotion is the cornerstone of genres such as drama, melodrama, and romance. In communication studies, scholars study the role that emotion plays in the dissemination of ideas and messages. Emotion is also studied in non-human animals in ethology, a branch of zoology which focuses on the scientific study of animal behavior. Ethology is a combination of laboratory and field science, with strong ties to ecology and evolution. Ethologists often study one type of behavior (for example, aggression) in a number of unrelated animals.\nHistory of emotions.\nThe history of emotions has become an increasingly popular topic recently, with some scholars arguing that it is an essential category of analysis, not unlike class, race, or gender. Historians, like other social scientists, assume that emotions, feelings and their expressions are regulated in different ways by both different cultures and different historical times, and the constructivist school of history claims even that some sentiments and meta-emotions, for example schadenfreude, are learnt and not only regulated by culture. Historians of emotion trace and analyze the changing norms and rules of feeling, while examining emotional regimes, codes, and lexicons from social, cultural, or political history perspectives. Others focus on the history of medicine, science, or psychology. What somebody can and may feel (and show) in a given situation, towards certain people or things, depends on social norms and rules; thus historically variable and open to change. Several research centers have opened in the past few years in Germany, England, Spain, Sweden, and Australia.\nFurthermore, research in historical trauma suggests that some traumatic emotions can be passed on from parents to offspring to second and even third generation, presented as examples of transgenerational trauma.\nSociology.\nA common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (for example, anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (for example, increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (for example, smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues. One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner's theory, and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant.\nAttempts are frequently made to regulate emotion according to the conventions of the society and the situation based on many (sometimes conflicting) demands and expectations which originate from various entities. The expression of anger is in many cultures discouraged in girls and women to a greater extent than in boys and men (the notion being that an angry man has a valid complaint that needs to be rectified, while an angry women is hysterical or oversensitive, and her anger is somehow invalid), while the expression of sadness or fear is discouraged in boys and men relative to girls and women (attitudes implicit in phrases like \"man up\" or \"don't be a sissy\"). Expectations attached to social roles, such as \"acting as man\" and not as a woman, and the accompanying \"feeling rules\" contribute to the differences in expression of certain emotions. Some cultures encourage or discourage happiness, sadness, or jealousy, and the free expression of the emotion of disgust is considered socially unacceptable in most cultures. Some social institutions are seen as based on certain emotion, such as love in the case of contemporary institution of marriage. In advertising, such as health campaigns and political messages, emotional appeals are commonly found. Recent examples include no-smoking health campaigns and political campaigns emphasizing the fear of terrorism.\nSociological attention to emotion has varied over time. \u00c9mile Durkheim (1915/1965) wrote about the collective effervescence or emotional energy that was experienced by members of totemic rituals in Australian Aboriginal society. He explained how the heightened state of emotional energy achieved during totemic rituals transported individuals above themselves giving them the sense that they were in the presence of a higher power, a force, that was embedded in the sacred objects that were worshipped. These feelings of exaltation, he argued, ultimately lead people to believe that there were forces that governed sacred objects.\nIn the 1990s, sociologists focused on different aspects of specific emotions and how these emotions were socially relevant. For Cooley (1992), pride and shame were the most important emotions that drive people to take various social actions. During every encounter, he proposed that we monitor ourselves through the \"looking glass\" that the gestures and reactions of others provide. Depending on these reactions, we either experience pride or shame and this results in particular paths of action. Retzinger (1991) conducted studies of married couples who experienced cycles of rage and shame. Drawing predominantly on Goffman and Cooley's work, Scheff (1990) developed a micro sociological theory of the social bond. The formation or disruption of social bonds is dependent on the emotions that people experience during interactions.\nSubsequent to these developments, Randall Collins (2004) formulated his interaction ritual theory by drawing on Durkheim's work on totemic rituals that was extended by Goffman (1964/2013; 1967) into everyday focused encounters. Based on interaction ritual theory, we experience different levels or intensities of emotional energy during face-to-face interactions. Emotional energy is considered to be a feeling of confidence to take action and a boldness that one experiences when they are charged up from the collective effervescence generated during group gatherings that reach high levels of intensity.\nThere is a growing body of research applying the sociology of emotion to understanding the learning experiences of students during classroom interactions with teachers and other students (for example, Milne &amp; Otieno, 2007; Olitsky, 2007; Tobin, et al., 2013; Zembylas, 2002). These studies show that learning subjects like science can be understood in terms of classroom interaction rituals that generate emotional energy and collective states of emotional arousal like emotional climate.\nApart from interaction ritual traditions of the sociology of emotion, other approaches have been classed into one of six other categories:\nThis list provides a general overview of different traditions in the sociology of emotion that sometimes conceptualize emotion in different ways and at other times in complementary ways. Many of these different approaches were synthesized by Turner (2007) in his sociological theory of human emotions in an attempt to produce one comprehensive sociological account that draws on developments from many of the above traditions.\nPsychotherapy and regulation.\nEmotion regulation refers to the cognitive and behavioral strategies people use to influence their own emotional experience. For example, a behavioral strategy in which one avoids a situation to avoid unwanted emotions (trying not to think about the situation, doing distracting activities, etc.). Depending on the particular school's general emphasis on either cognitive components of emotion, physical energy discharging, or on symbolic movement and facial expression components of emotion different schools of psychotherapy approach the regulation of emotion differently. Cognitively oriented schools approach them via their cognitive components, such as rational emotive behavior therapy. Yet others approach emotions via symbolic movement and facial expression components (like in contemporary Gestalt therapy).\nCross-cultural research.\nResearch on emotions reveals the strong presence of cross-cultural differences in emotional reactions and that emotional reactions are likely to be culture-specific. In strategic settings, cross-cultural research on emotions is required for understanding the psychological situation of a given population or specific actors. This implies the need to comprehend the current emotional state, mental disposition or other behavioral motivation of a target audience located in a different culture, basically founded on its national, political, social, economic, and psychological peculiarities but also subject to the influence of circumstances and events.\nComputer science.\nIn the 2000s, research in computer science, engineering, psychology and neuroscience has been aimed at developing devices that recognize human affect display and model emotions. In computer science, affective computing is a branch of the study and development of artificial intelligence that deals with the design of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, and process human emotions. It is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer sciences, psychology, and cognitive science. While the origins of the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical enquiries into emotion, the more modern branch of computer science originated with Rosalind Picard's 1995 paper on affective computing. Detecting emotional information begins with passive sensors which capture data about the user's physical state or behavior without interpreting the input. The data gathered is analogous to the cues humans use to perceive emotions in others. Another area within affective computing is the design of computational devices proposed to exhibit either innate emotional capabilities or that are capable of convincingly simulating emotions. Emotional speech processing recognizes the user's emotional state by analyzing speech patterns. The detection and processing of facial expression or body gestures is achieved through detectors and sensors.\nEffects on memory.\nEmotion affects the way autobiographical memories are encoded and retrieved. Emotional memories are reactivated more, they are remembered better and have more attention devoted to them. Through remembering our past achievements and failures, autobiographical memories affect how we perceive and feel about ourselves.\nNotable theorists.\nIn the late 19th century, the most influential theorists were William James (1842\u20131910) and Carl Lange (1834\u20131900). James was an American psychologist and philosopher who wrote about educational psychology, psychology of religious experience/mysticism, and the philosophy of pragmatism. Lange was a Danish physician and psychologist. Working independently, they developed the James\u2013Lange theory, a hypothesis on the origin and nature of emotions. The theory states that within human beings, as a response to experiences in the world, the autonomic nervous system creates physiological events such as muscular tension, a rise in heart rate, perspiration, and dryness of the mouth. Emotions, then, are feelings which come about as a result of these physiological changes, rather than being their cause.\nSilvan Tomkins (1911\u20131991) developed the affect theory and script theory. The affect theory introduced the concept of basic emotions, and was based on the idea that the dominance of the emotion, which he called the affected system, was the motivating force in human life.\nSome of the most influential deceased theorists on emotion from the 20th century include Magda B. Arnold (1903\u20132002), an American psychologist who developed the appraisal theory of emotions; Richard Lazarus (1922\u20132002), an American psychologist who specialized in emotion and stress, especially in relation to cognition; Herbert A. Simon (1916\u20132001), who included emotions into decision making and artificial intelligence; Robert Plutchik (1928\u20132006), an American psychologist who developed a psychoevolutionary theory of emotion; Robert Zajonc (1923\u20132008) a Polish\u2013American social psychologist who specialized in social and cognitive processes such as social facilitation; Robert C. Solomon (1942\u20132007), an American philosopher who contributed to the theories on the philosophy of emotions with books such as \"What Is An Emotion?: Classic and Contemporary Readings\" (2003); Peter Goldie (1946\u20132011), a British philosopher who specialized in ethics, aesthetics, emotion, mood and character; Nico Frijda (1927\u20132015), a Dutch psychologist who advanced the theory that human emotions serve to promote a tendency to undertake actions that are appropriate in the circumstances, detailed in his book \"The Emotions\" (1986); Jaak Panksepp (1943\u20132017), an Estonian-born American psychologist, psychobiologist, neuroscientist and pioneer in affective neuroscience; John T. Cacioppo (1951\u20132018), one of the founding fathers of social neuroscience; George Mandler (1924\u20132016), an American psychologist who wrote influential books on cognition and emotion.\nInfluential theorists who are still active include the following psychologists, neurologists, philosophers, and sociologists:"}
{"id": "10407", "revid": "756128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10407", "title": "Epictetus", "text": "Epictetus (, ; , \"Ep\u00edkt\u0113tos\"; 50 135 AD) was a Greek Stoic philosopher. He was born into slavery at Hierapolis, Phrygia (present-day Pamukkale, in western Turkey) and lived in Rome until his banishment, when he went to Nicopolis in northwestern Greece, where he spent the rest of his life. \nEpictetus studied Stoic philosophy under Musonius Rufus and after manumission, his formal emancipation from slavery, he began to teach philosophy. Subject to the banishment of all philosophers from Rome by Emperor Domitian toward the end of the first century, Epictetus founded a school of philosophy in Nicopolis. Epictetus taught that philosophy is a way of life and not simply a theoretical discipline. To Epictetus, all external events are beyond our control; he argues that we should accept whatever happens calmly and dispassionately. However, he held that individuals are responsible for their own actions, which they can examine and control through rigorous self-discipline. His teachings were written down and published by his pupil Arrian in his \"Discourses\" and \"Enchiridion\". They influenced many later thinkers including Marcus Aurelius, Pascal, Diderot, Montesquieu, and Rabelais.\nLife.\nHaving described himself as old in 108 AD, Epictetus is presumed to have been born around AD 50, at Hierapolis, Phrygia. The name given by his parents is unknown. The name by which he is known is derived from the word \"ep\u00edkt\u0113tos\" (\u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03ba\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2) that in Greek, simply means \"gained\" or \"acquired\"; the Greek philosopher Plato, in his \"Laws\", used that term to mean property that is \"added to one's hereditary property\". Epictetus spent his youth in Rome as a slave to Epaphroditus, a wealthy freedman who was secretary to Nero. His social position was thus complicated, combining the low status of a slave with the high status of one with a personal connection to Imperial power.\nEarly in life, Epictetus acquired a passion for philosophy and, with the permission of his wealthy master, he studied Stoic philosophy under Musonius Rufus. Becoming more educated in this way raised his social status. At some point, he became disabled. Celsus, quoted by Origen, wrote that this was because his leg had been deliberately broken by his master. Without citing a cause, Simplicius wrote that Epictetus had been disabled from childhood.\nEpictetus obtained his freedom sometime after the death of Nero in AD 68, and he began to teach philosophy in Rome. Around AD 93, when the Roman emperor Domitian banished all philosophers from the city, Epictetus moved to Nicopolis in Epirus, Greece, where he founded a school of philosophy.\nHis most famous pupil, Arrian, studied under him as a young man (around AD 108) and claimed to have written his famous \"Discourses\" based on the notes he took about lectures by Epictetus. Arrian argued that his Discourses should be considered comparable to the Socratic literature. Arrian described Epictetus as a powerful speaker who could \"induce his listener to feel just what Epictetus wanted him to feel\". Many eminent figures sought conversations with him. Emperor Hadrian was friendly with him, possibly having heard Epictetus speak at his school in Nicopolis.\nEpictetus lived a life of great simplicity, with few possessions. He lived alone for a long time, but in his old age, he adopted the child of a friend who otherwise would have been left to die, and raised him with the aid of a woman. It is unclear whether Epictetus and she were married. He died sometime around AD 135. After his death, according to Lucian, his oil lamp was purchased by an admirer for 3,000 drachmae.\nThought.\nNo writings by Epictetus are known. His discourses were transcribed and compiled by his pupil Arrian (). The main work is \"The Discourses\", four books of which have been preserved (out of the original eight). Arrian also compiled a popular digest, entitled the \"Enchiridion\", or \"Handbook\", of Epictetus. In a preface to the \"Discourses\" that is addressed to Lucius Gellius, Arrian states that \"whatever I heard him say I used to write down, word for word, as best I could, endeavouring to preserve it as a memorial, for my own future use, of his way of thinking and the frankness of his speech\". In the sixth century, the Neoplatonist philosopher Simplicius wrote an extant commentary on the \"Enchiridion\".\nEpictetus maintains that the foundation of all philosophy is self-knowledge; that is, the conviction of our ignorance and gullibility ought to be the first subject of our study. Logic provides valid reasoning and certainty in judgment, but it is subordinate to practical needs. He also maintained that the first and most necessary part of philosophy concerns the application of doctrine, for example, that people should not lie. The second concerns reasons, e.g., why people should not lie. The third, lastly, examines and establishes the reasons. This is the logical part, which finds reasons, shows what is a reason, and that a given reason is a correct one. This last part is necessary, but only on account of the second, which again is rendered necessary by the first.\n\"Prohairesis\".\nBoth the \"Discourses\" and the \"Enchiridion\" begin by distinguishing between those things in our power (\"prohairetic\" things) and those things not in our power (\"aprohairetic\" things).\nThat alone is in our power, which is our own work; and in this class are our opinions, impulses, desires, and aversions. On the contrary, what is not in our power, are our bodies, possessions, glory, and power. Any delusion on this point leads to the greatest errors, misfortunes, and troubles, and to the slavery of the soul.\nThe determination between what is good and what is not good is made by the capacity for choice (\"prohairesis\"). Prohairesis allows us to act, and gives us the kind of freedom that only rational animals have. It is determined by our reason, which of all our faculties, sees and tests itself and everything else. It is the correct use of the impressions (\"phantasia\") that bombard the mind that is in our power:\nPractice then from the start to say to every harsh impression, \"You are an impression, and not at all the thing you appear to be.\" Then examine it and test it by these rules you have, and firstly, and chiefly, by this: whether the impression has to do with the things that are up to us, or those that are not; and if it has to do with the things that are not up to us, be ready to reply, \"It is nothing to me.\"\nWe will not be troubled at any loss, but will say to ourselves on such an occasion: \"I have lost nothing that belongs to me; it was not something of mine that was torn from me, but something that was not in my power has left me.\" Nothing beyond the use of our opinion is properly ours. Every possession rests on opinion. What is to cry and to weep? An opinion. What is misfortune, or a quarrel, or a complaint? All these things are opinions; opinions founded on the delusion that what is not subject to our own choice can be either good or evil, which it cannot. By rejecting these opinions, and seeking good and evil in the power of choice alone, we may confidently achieve peace of mind in every condition of life.\nGood and evil.\nEpictetus says that:\nReason alone is good, the irrational is evil, and the irrational is intolerable to the rational. The good person should labour chiefly on their own reason; to perfect this is in our power. To repel evil opinions by the good is the noble contest in which humans should engage; it is not an easy task, but it promises true freedom, peace of mind (\"ataraxia\"), and a divine command over the emotions (\"apatheia\"). We should especially be on our guard against the opinion of pleasure because of its apparent sweetness and charms. The first object of philosophy, therefore, is to purify the mind.\nThe preconceptions (\"prolepsis\") of good and evil are common to all. Good alone is profitable and to be desired, and evil is hurtful and to be avoided. Different opinions arise only from the application of these preconceptions to particular cases, and it is then that the darkness of ignorance, which blindly maintains the correctness of its own opinion, must be dispelled. People entertain different and conflicting opinions of good, and in their judgment of a particular good, people frequently contradict themselves. Philosophy should provide a standard for good and evil. This process is greatly facilitated because the mind and the works of the mind are alone in our power, whereas all external things that aid life are beyond our control.\nThe essence of divinity is goodness; we have all good that could be given to us. The deities too gave us the soul and reason, which is not measured by breadth or depth, but by knowledge and sentiments, and by which we attain to greatness, and may equal even with the deities. We should, therefore, cultivate the mind with special care. If we wish for nothing, but what the gods will, we shall be truly free, and all will come to pass with us according to our desire; and we shall be as little subject to restraint as Zeus himself.\nEvery individual is connected with the rest of the world, and the universe is fashioned for universal harmony. Wise people, therefore, will pursue, not merely their own will, but also will be subject to the rightful order of the world. We should conduct ourselves through life fulfilling all our duties as children, siblings, parents, and citizens.\nFor our country or friends we ought to be ready to undergo or perform the greatest difficulties. The good person, if able to foresee the future, would peacefully and contentedly help to bring about their own sickness, maiming, and even death, knowing that this is the correct order of the universe. We have all a certain part to play in the world, and we have done enough when we have performed what our nature allows. In the exercise of our powers, we may become aware of the destiny we are intended to fulfil.\nWe are like travellers at an inn or guests at a stranger's table; whatever is offered we take with thankfulness, and sometimes, when the turn comes, we may refuse; in the former case we are a worthy guest of the deities, and in the latter we appear as a sharer in their power. Anyone who finds life intolerable is free to quit it, but we should not abandon our appointed role without sufficient reason. The Stoic sage will never find life intolerable and will complain of no one, neither deity nor human. Those who go wrong we should pardon and treat with compassion, since it is from ignorance that they err, being as it were, blind.\nIt is only our opinions and principles that can render us unhappy, and it is only the ignorant person who finds fault with another. Every desire degrades us, and renders us slaves of what we desire. We ought not to forget the transitory character of all external advantages, even in the midst of our enjoyment of them; but always to bear in mind that they are not our own, and that therefore, they do not properly belong to us. Thus prepared, we shall never be carried away by opinions.\nThe final entry of the \"Enchiridion,\" or \"Handbook,\" begins: \"Upon all occasions we ought to have these maxims ready at hand\":\nInfluence.\n\"Dialogue Between the Emperor Hadrian and Epictetus\".\nEpictetus appears in a second or third century \"Dialogue Between the Emperor Hadrian and Epictetus the Philosopher\". This short Latin text consists of seventy-three short questions supposedly posed by Hadrian and answered by Epictetus. This dialogue was very popular in the Middle Ages with many translations and adaptations.\nPhilosophy.\nMarcus Aurelius.\nThe philosophy of Epictetus influenced the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (AD 121 to AD 180), who cites Epictetus in his \"Meditations\".\nFrench philosophers.\nEnlightenment philosophers Voltaire, Montesquieu, Denis Diderot, and Baron d'Holbach all read the \"Enchiridion\" when they were students. Blaise Pascal listed Epictetus as among those philosophers he was most familiar with, describing him as a \"great mind\" who is \"among the philosophers of the world who have best understood the duties\" of an individual.\nLiterature.\nThe philosophy of Epictetus plays a key role in the 1998 novel \"A Man in Full\" by Tom Wolfe. This was in part the outcome of discussions Wolfe had with James Stockdale (see below). The character Conrad, who through a series of mishaps finds himself in jail and accidentally acquires a copy of the \"Enchiridion of Epictetus\", the Stoic's manual, discovers a philosophy that strengthens him to endure the brutality of the prison environment. He experiences Joseph Campbell's 'hero's journey' call to action and becomes a strong, honorable, undefeatable protagonist. The importance of Epictetus' Stoicism for Stockdale, its role in \"A Man in Full\", and its significance in Ridley Scott's film \"Gladiator\" are discussed by William O. Stephens in \"The Rebirth of Stoicism?\".\nMohun Biswas, in the novel \"A House for Mr Biswas\" (1961), by V. S. Naipaul, is pleased to think himself a follower of Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius; the irony is that he never actually behaves as a Stoic.\n\"Everything has two handles, the one by which it may be carried, the other by which it cannot\" is the theme of \"Disturbances in the Field\" (1983), by Lynne Sharon Schwartz. Lydia, the central character, turns often to \"The Golden Sayings of Epictetus\" \u2013 the latter being a modern selection from Epictetus's writings, compiled and translated by Hastings Crossley.\nA line from the \"Enchiridion\" is used as a title quotation in \"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman\" by Laurence Sterne, which translates to, \"Not things, but opinions about things, trouble men.\"\nEpictetus is mentioned in \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" by James Joyce: in the fifth chapter of the novel the protagonist Stephen Dedalus discusses Epictetus's famous lamp with a dean of his college. Epictetus also is mentioned briefly in \"Franny and Zooey\" by J. D. Salinger, and is referred to by Theodore Dreiser in his novel \"Sister Carrie\". Both the longevity of Epictetus's life and his philosophy are alluded to in John Berryman's poem \"Of Suicide\".\nEpictetus is referred to, but not mentioned by name, in Matthew Arnold's sonnet \"To a Friend\". Arnold provides three historical personalities as his inspiration and support in difficult times (Epictetus is preceded by Homer and succeeded by Sophocles):\n&lt;poem&gt;Much he, whose friendship I not long since won,\nThat halting slave, who in Nicopolis\nTaught Arrian, when Vespasian's brutal son\nCleared Rome of what most shamed him.&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe title character in Julian Barnes's 2022 novel \"Elizabeth Finch\" impresses the teachings of Epictetus on her students.\nFran\u00e7ois Rabelais.\nIn the Chapter XXX of Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais' \"Pantagruel\" (c. 1532), Pantagruel's tutor Epistemon had his head cut off after a battle. After he had his head reattached and was brought back to life, he recounts his experience of the damned in hell:\nMilitary.\nJames Stockdale.\nJames Stockdale, a fighter pilot who was shot down while serving in the Vietnam War, was influenced by Epictetus. He was introduced to his works while at Stanford University. In \"Courage under Fire: Testing Epictetus's Doctrines in a Laboratory of Human Behavior\" (1993), Stockdale credits Epictetus with helping him endure his seven and a half years in captivity, which included torture and four years in solitary confinement. When he was shot down, he reportedly said to himself \"I'm leaving the world of technology and entering the world of Epictetus!\" as he bailed out.\nQuoting Epictetus, Stockdale concludes the book with:\nThe emotions of grief, pity, and even affection are well-known disturbers of the soul. Grief is the most offensive; Epictetus considered the suffering of grief an act of evil. It is a willful act, going against the will of God to have all men share happiness.\nPsychology.\nPsychologist Albert Ellis, the founder of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, credited Epictetus with providing a foundation for his system of psychotherapy.\nReligion.\nKiyozawa Manshi, a controversial reformer within the Higashi Honganji branch of Jodo Shinshu Buddhism, cited Epictetus as one of the three major influences on his spiritual development and thought."}
{"id": "10408", "revid": "33569912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10408", "title": "Edward Lear", "text": "Edward Lear (12 May 1812 \u2013 29 January 1888) was an English artist, illustrator, musician, author and poet, who is known mostly for his literary nonsense in poetry and prose and especially his limericks, a form he popularised.\nHis principal areas of work as an artist were threefold: as a draughtsman employed to make illustrations of birds and animals, making coloured drawings during his journeys (which he reworked later, sometimes as plates for his travel books) and as a minor illustrator of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poems.\nAs an author, he is known principally for his popular nonsense collections of poems, songs, short stories, botanical drawings, recipes and alphabets. He also composed and published twelve musical settings of Tennyson's poetry.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nLear was born into a middle-class family at Holloway, North London, the penultimate of 21 children (and youngest to survive) of Ann Clark Skerrett and Jeremiah Lear, a stockbroker formerly working for the family sugar refining business. He was raised by his eldest sister, also named Ann, 21 years his senior. Jeremiah Lear ended up defaulting to the London Stock Exchange in the economic upheaval following the Napoleonic Wars. Because of the family's now more limited finances, when he was aged four, Lear and his sister were required to leave the family home, Bowmans Lodge, and live together. Ann doted on Edward and continued to act as a mother to him until her death, when he was almost 50 years of age.\nLear had lifelong health problems. From the age of six, he had frequent \"grand mal\" epileptic seizures, bronchitis, asthma and, during later life, partial blindness. Lear experienced his first seizure at a fair near Highgate when with his father. The event scared and embarrassed him. He felt lifelong guilt and shame for his epileptic condition, and his adult diaries indicate that he always sensed the onset of a seizure in time to remove himself from public view. When Lear was about seven years old he began to show signs of depression, possibly due to the instability of his childhood. He had periods of severe melancholia which he referred to as \"the Morbids\".\nArtist.\nLear was already drawing \"for bread and cheese\" by the time he was aged 16 and soon developed into a serious \"ornithological draughtsman\" employed by the Zoological Society and from 1832 to 1836 by the Earl of Derby, who kept a private menagerie at his estate, Knowsley Hall. He was the first major bird artist to draw birds from life rather than the skins of specimens. Lear's first publication, published when he was 19 years old, was \"Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots\" in 1830. One of the greatest ornithological artists of his era, he taught Elizabeth Gould whilst also contributing to John Gould's works and was compared by some to the naturalist John James Audubon. In honour of Lear's bird illustrations, \"Anodorhynchus leari\", popular name Lear's macaw, is named after him.\nAfter his eyesight deteriorated too much to work with such precision on the fine drawings and etchings of plates used in lithography, he turned to landscape painting and travel.\nAmong other travels, he visited Greece and Egypt during 1848\u201349 and toured India during 1873\u201375, including a brief detour to Ceylon. While travelling he produced large quantities of coloured wash drawings in a distinctive style, which he converted later in his studio into oil and watercolour paintings, as well as prints for his books. His landscape style often shows views with strong sunlight, with intense contrasts of colour. \nBetween 1878 and 1883, Lear spent his summers on Monte Generoso, a mountain on the border between the Swiss canton of Ticino and the Italian region of Lombardy. His oil painting \"The Plains of Lombardy from Monte Generoso\" is in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.\nThroughout his life, he continued to paint seriously. He had a lifelong ambition to illustrate Tennyson's poems; near the end of his life, a volume with a small number of illustrations was published.\n\"Illustrated Excursions in Italy\" (1842\u201347).\nIn 1842, Lear began a journey into the Italian peninsula, travelling through the Lazio, Rome, Abruzzo, Molise, Apulia, Basilicata, Calabria and Sicily. In personal notes, together with drawings, Lear gathered his impressions on the Italian way of life, folk traditions, and the beauty of the ancient monuments. Of particular interest to Lear was the Abruzzo, which he visited in 1843, through the Marsica (Celano, Avezzano, Alba Fucens, Trasacco) and the plateau of Cinque Miglia (Castel di Sangro and Alfedena), by an old sheep track of the shepherds.\nLear drew a sketch of the medieval village of Albe with Mount Sirente, and described the medieval village of Celano, with the castle of Piccolomini dominating the vast plain of Lago Fucino, which was drained a few years later to promote agricultural development. At Castel di Sangro, Lear described the winter stillness of the mountains and the beautiful basilica.\nMore adventurous was the voyage to the regions of southern Italy in 1847, described in Lear's \"Journals of a Landscape Painter in Southern Calabria, &amp; c\". The broad Calabria section in which Lear tells his itinerary among breathtaking landscapes and often surreal characters, is thought to be among the best in his travel literature.\nComposer and musician.\nLear primarily played the piano, but he also played the accordion, flute, and small guitar. He composed music for many Romantic and Victorian poems, but was known mostly for his many musical settings of Tennyson's poetry. He published four settings in 1853, five in 1859, and three in 1860. Lear's were the only musical settings that Tennyson approved of. Lear also composed music for many of his nonsense songs, including \"The Owl and the Pussy-Cat\", but only two of the scores have survived, the music for \"The Courtship of the Yonghy-Bonghy-B\u00f2\" and \"The Pelican Chorus\". While he never played professionally, he did perform his own nonsense songs and his settings of others' poetry at countless social gatherings, sometimes adding his own lyrics (as with the song \"The Nervous Family\"), and sometimes replacing serious lyrics with nursery rhymes.\nRelationships.\nLear's most fervent and painful friendship was with Franklin Lushington. He met the young barrister in Malta in 1849 and toured southern Greece with him. Lear developed an infatuation for him that Lushington did not wholly reciprocate. Although they remained friends for almost forty years until Lear's death, the disparity of their feelings constantly tormented Lear. Indeed, Lear's attempts at male companionship were not always successful; the very intensity of Lear's affections may have doomed these relationships.\nHe proposed twice to another writer, Augusta Bethell, whom he had known for a long time, when he was 26 years her senior. For companions, he relied instead on friends and correspondents, and especially, during later life, on his Albanian Souliote chef, Giorgis, a faithful friend and (as Lear complained) a thoroughly unsatisfactory chef. Another trusted companion in San Remo was his cat, Foss, who died in 1887 and was buried with some ceremony in a garden at Villa Tennyson.\nSan Remo and death.\nLear eventually settled in San Remo, on his beloved Mediterranean coast in the 1870s at a villa he named \"Villa Tennyson\".\nLear was known to introduce himself with a long pseudonym: \"Mr Abebika kratoponoko Prizzikalo Kattefello Ablegorabalus Ableborinto phashyph\" or \"Chakonoton the Cozovex Dossi Fossi Sini Tomentilla Coronilla Polentilla\nBattledore &amp; Shuttlecock Derry down Derry Dumps\", which he based on \"Aldiborontiphoskyphorniostikos\".\nAfter a long decline in his health, Lear died at his villa in 1888 of heart disease, which he had since at least 1870. Lear's funeral was described as a sad, lonely affair by the wife of Dr. Hassall, Lear's physician, none of Lear's many lifelong friends being able to attend.\nLear is buried in the Cemetery Foce in San Remo. On his headstone are inscribed these lines about Mount Tomohrit (in Albania) from Tennyson's poem \"To E.L. [Edward Lear], On His Travels in Greece\":\nThe centenary of his death was marked in Britain with a set of Royal Mail stamps in 1988 and an exhibition at the Royal Academy. Lear's birthplace area is now marked with a plaque at Bowman's Mews, Islington, in London, and his bicentenary during 2012 was celebrated with a variety of events, exhibitions and lectures in venues across the world including an International Owl and Pussycat Day on his birth anniversary.\nAuthor.\nIn 1846, Lear published \",\" a volume of limericks which went through three editions and helped popularise the form and the genre of literary nonsense. In 1871, he published \"Nonsense Songs, Stories, Botany and Alphabets\", which included the nonsense song \"The Owl and the Pussy-Cat\", which he wrote for the children of his patron Edward Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby. Many other works followed.\nLear's nonsense books were quite popular during his lifetime, but a rumour developed that \"Edward Lear\" was merely a pseudonym, and the books' true author was the man to whom Lear had dedicated the works, his patron the Earl of Derby. Promoters of this rumour offered as evidence that both men were named Edward, and that \"Lear\" is an anagram of \"Earl\".\nLear's nonsense works are distinguished by a facility of verbal invention and a poet's delight in the sounds of words, both real and imaginary. A stuffed rhinoceros becomes a \"diaphanous doorscraper\". A \"blue Boss-Woss\" plunges into \"a perpendicular, spicular, orbicular, quadrangular, circular depth of soft mud\". His heroes are Quangle-Wangles, Pobbles, and Jumblies. One of his most famous verbal inventions, the phrase \"runcible spoon\", occurs in the closing lines of \"The Owl and the Pussy-Cat\" and is now found in many English dictionaries.\nThough known for his neologisms, Lear used a number of other devices in his works in order to defy reader expectations. For example, \"Cold Are the Crabs\" conforms to the sonnet tradition until its dramatically foreshortened last line.\nToday, limericks are invariably typeset as five lines. Lear's limericks, however, were published in a variety of formats; it appears that Lear wrote them in manuscript in as many lines as there was room for beneath the picture. For the first three editions, most are typeset as, respectively, two, five, and three lines. The cover of one edition bears an entire limerick typeset in two lines:\nIn Lear's limericks, the first and last lines usually end with the same word rather than rhyming. For the most part they are truly nonsensical and devoid of any punch line or point. They are completely free of the bawdiness with which the verse form is now associated. A typical thematic element is the presence of a callous and critical \"they\". An example of a typical Lear limerick:\nLear's self-description in verse, \"How Pleasant to know Mr. Lear,\" ends with this stanza, a reference to his own mortality:\nFive of Lear's limericks from the \"Book of Nonsense\" (in the 1946 Italian translation by Carlo Izzo) were set to music for choir a cappella by Goffredo Petrassi in 1952.\nPortrayals.\nEdward Lear has been played in radio dramas by Andrew Sachs in \"The Need for Nonsense\" by Julia Blackburn (BBC Radio 4, 9 February 2009) and by Derek Jacobi in \"By the Coast of Coromandel\" by Lavinia Murray (BBC Radio 4, 21 December 2011). He was portrayed on television by Robert Lang in \"Edward Lear: On the Edge of the Sand\" a special episode of The Natural World, BBC2 14 April 1985.\nIn popular culture.\nLear's written work was used extensively in the short-lived \"The Tomfoolery Show,\" a Saturday morning cartoon that was produced by Rankin-Bass and broadcast on NBC from 1970 to 1971. \"A Beach Full of Shells\", the 20th album by musician Al Stewart pays tribute in the song \"Mr. Lear\", celebrating Foss and many events from Lear's life.\nArchival collections.\nThe largest collection by far of Edward Lear original drawings resides in the Printing and Graphic Arts Collection at Houghton Library. Additional major Lear collections may be found at the Yale Center for British Art, the Liverpool Libraries, and Gennadius Library in Athens."}

She performed in leading and supporting roles for nearly six decades.\nBeginning her film career in 1929 and on Broadway in the early 1930s, Arden's first major role was in the RKO Radio Pictures drama \"Stage Door\" (1937) opposite Katharine Hepburn, followed by roles in the comedies \"Having Wonderful Time\" (1938) and \"At the Circus\" (1939). She received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her role in \"Mildred Pierce\" (1945).\nSomewhat surprisingly for an actress of Arden's refinement and wit, she appeared to good effect in a number of films noir, some exceptionally high-profile, including \"Mildred Pierce\", \"The Unfaithful\" (1947), \"The Arnelo Affair\" (1947), \"Whiplash\" (1948), and \"Anatomy of a Murder\" (1959).\nLater in her career, Arden moved to television, playing a sardonic but engaging high school teacher in \"Our Miss Brooks\", for which she won the first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. She also played the maternity ward nurse in \"Bewitched\" and the school principal in the film musicals \"Grease\" (1978) and \"Grease 2\" (1982).\nEarly life.\nEve Arden was born Eunice Mary Quedens on April 30, 1908, in Mill Valley, California, to Charles Peter Quedens, the son of Charles Henry Augustus Quedens and Eunice Meta Dierks, and Lucille Frank, the daughter of Bernard Frank and Louisa Mertens. Lucille, a milliner, divorced Charles over his gambling and went into business for herself.\nAlthough not Catholic, young Eunice was sent to a Dominican convent school in San Rafael, California. She then attended Tamalpais High School, a public high school in Mill Valley, until age 16. After leaving school, she joined the stock theater company of Henry \"Terry\" Duffy.\nCareer.\nFilm.\nShe made her film debut under her real name in the backstage musical \"Song of Love\" (1929), as a wisecracking, homewrecking showgirl who becomes a rival to the film's star, singer Belle Baker. The film was one of Columbia Pictures' earliest successes. In 1933, she relocated to New York City, where she had supporting parts in several Broadway stage productions. In 1934, she was cast in the \"Ziegfeld Follies\" revue, the first role where she was credited as Eve Arden. When she was told to adopt a stage name for the show, Arden looked at her cosmetics and \"stole my first name from Evening in Paris, and the second from Elizabeth Arden\". Between 1934 and 1941, she appeared in Broadway productions of \"Parade\", \"Very Warm for May\", \"Two for the Show\", and \"Let's Face It!\".\nArden's film career began in earnest in 1937 when she signed a contract with RKO Radio Pictures and appeared in the films \"Oh Doctor\" and \"Stage Door\". Her \"Stage Door\" portrayal of a fast-talking, witty supporting character gained Arden considerable notice and was a template for many of Arden's future roles.\nIn 1938, she played a supporting part in the comedy \"Having Wonderful Time\", starring Ginger Rogers and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. This was followed by roles in the crime film \"The Forgotten Woman\" (1939), and the Marx Brothers comedy \"At the Circus\" (1939), a role that required her to perform acrobatics.\nIn 1940, she appeared in support of Clark Gable and Hedy Lamarr in \"Comrade X\", followed by support in the drama \"Manpower\" (1941) opposite Marlene Dietrich, Edward G. Robinson and George Raft. She also had a supporting part in the Red Skelton comedy \"Whistling in the Dark\" (1941) and the romantic comedy \"Obliging Young Lady\" (1942).\nHer many memorable screen roles include a supporting role as Joan Crawford's wise-cracking friend in \"Mildred Pierce\" (1945), for which she received an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actress; as a catty cousin turned peacemaker in The Unfaithful (1947); and as James Stewart's wistful but wry secretary in Otto Preminger's mystery \"Anatomy of a Murder\" (1959) (which also featured her husband, Brooks West). In 1946, exhibitors voted her the sixth-most promising \"star of tomorrow\".\nArden became familiar to a new generation of filmgoers when she played Principal McGee in \"Grease\" (1978) and \"Grease 2 (1982)\". Arden was known for her deadpan comedic delivery.\nRadio and television.\nArden's ability with witty scripts made her a natural talent for radio. She was a regular on Danny Kaye's short-lived but memorably zany comedy-variety show in 1946, which also featured swing bandleader Harry James and gravel-voiced character actor-comedian Lionel Stander.\nThe additional exposure of Arden's comic talent on Kaye's show led to her best-known role, that of Madison High School English teacher Connie Brooks in \"Our Miss Brooks\". Arden portrayed the character on radio from 1948 to 1957, in a television version of the program from 1952 to 1956, and in a 1956 feature film. Her character clashed with the school's principal, Osgood Conklin (played by Gale Gordon) and nursed an unrequited crush on fellow teacher Philip Boynton (played originally by future film star Jeff Chandler; and later on radio and TV by Robert Rockwell). Except for Chandler, the entire radio cast of Arden, Gordon, Richard Crenna (Walter Denton), Robert Rockwell (Mr. Philip Boynton), Gloria McMillan (Harriet Conklin) and Jane Morgan (landlady Margaret Davis) played the same roles on TV.\nArden's portrayal of Miss Brooks was so popular that she was made an honorary member of the National Education Association, received a 1952 award from the Teachers College of Connecticut's Alumni Association \"for humanizing the American teacher\", and even received teaching job offers. Her well-established wisecracking, deadpan character ultimately became her public persona as a comedienne.\nShe won a listeners' poll by \"Radio Mirror\" magazine as the top-ranking comedienne of 1948\u20131949, receiving her award at the end of an \"Our Miss Brooks\" broadcast that March. \"I'm certainly going to try in the coming months to merit the honor you've bestowed upon me, because I understand that if I win this (award) two years in a row, I get to keep Mr. Boynton,\" she joked. She was also a hit with the critics: A winter 1949 poll of newspaper and magazine radio editors by \"Motion Picture Daily\" named her the year's best radio comedienne.\nArden had a very brief guest appearance in a 1955 \"I Love Lucy\" episode titled \"L.A. at Last\", where she played herself. While awaiting their food at the Brown Derby, Lucy Ricardo (Lucille Ball) and Ethel Mertz (Vivian Vance) argue over whether a certain portrait on a nearby wall is Shelley Winters or Judy Holliday. Lucy urges Ethel to ask a lady occupying the next booth, who turns and replies, \"Neither. That's Eve Arden.\" As Ethel realizes she just spoke to Arden herself, Arden passes Lucy and Ethel's table to leave the restaurant while the pair gawk.\nDesilu Productions, jointly owned by Desi Arnaz and Ball during their marriage, was the production company for the \"Our Miss Brooks\" television show, filmed during the same years as \"I Love Lucy\". Ball and Arden met when they costarred in the film \"Stage Door\" in 1937. Ball, according to numerous radio historians, suggested Arden for \"Our Miss Brooks\" after Shirley Booth auditioned for but failed to land the role and Ball\u2014committed at the time to \"My Favorite Husband\"\u2014could not.\nArden tried another series for CBS in the fall of 1957, \"The Eve Arden Show\", but it was canceled in spring of 1958 after 26 episodes. In 1966, she played Nurse Kelton in an episode of \"Bewitched\". She later costarred with Kaye Ballard as her neighbor and in-law, Eve Hubbard, in the 1967\u20131969 NBC situation comedy \"The Mothers-in-Law\", produced by Arnaz after the dissolution of Desilu Productions. In her later career, Arden made appearances on such television shows as \"Bewitched\", \"Alice\", \"Maude, Hart to Hart\", and \"Falcon Crest\". In 1985, she appeared as the wicked stepmother in the \"Faerie Tale Theatre\" production of \"Cinderella\".\nStage.\nArden was one of many actresses to take on the title roles in \"Hello, Dolly!\" and \"Auntie Mame\" in the 1960s; in 1967, she won the Sarah Siddons Award for her work in Chicago theater. In 1983, Arden was cast as the leading lady in what was to be her Broadway comeback, \"Moose Murders\", but she withdrew and was replaced with the much younger Holland Taylor after one preview performance, citing \"artistic differences\". The show went on to open and close on the same night, becoming known a legendary flop in Broadway history.\nPersonal life.\nArden was married to Edward Grinnell \"Ned\" Bergen 1939\u201347 and reportedly had a long relationship with Danny Kaye through the 1940s (likely starting from their Broadway work on \"Let's Face It!\" in 1941). Arden was married to actor Brooks West from 1952 until his death in 1984 from a brain hemorrhage at age 67. She adopted her first child with Bergen and a second child as a single mother after her divorce from him; she adopted her third child with West and gave birth to her youngest (with West) at age 46 in 1954. All four children survived their parents.\nDeath.\nOn November 12, 1990, Arden died at home at age 82. According to her death certificate, she died of cardiac arrest and arteriosclerotic heart disease. She is buried in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery, Westwood, Los Angeles, California.\nLegacy.\nArden published an autobiography, \"The Three Phases of Eve\", in 1985. In addition to her Academy Award nomination, Arden has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: Radio and Television (see List of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for addresses). She was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1995."}

An algebraic treatment of elementary functions was started by Joseph Fels Ritt in the 1930s. Many textbooks and dictionaries do not give a precise definition of the elementary functions, and mathematicians differ on it.\nExamples.\nBasic examples.\nElementary functions of a single variable include:\nCertain elementary functions of a single complex variable , such as formula_9 and formula_10, may be multivalued. Additionally, certain classes of functions may be obtained by others using the final two rules. For example, the exponential function formula_11 composed with addition, subtraction, and division provides the hyperbolic functions, while initial composition with formula_12 instead provides the trigonometric functions.\nComposite examples.\nExamples of elementary functions include:\nThe last function is equal to formula_15, the inverse cosine, in the entire complex plane.\nAll monomials, polynomials, rational functions and algebraic functions are elementary. \nThe absolute value function, for real formula_16, is also elementary as it can be expressed as the composition of a power and root of formula_16: formula_18.\nNon-elementary functions.\nMany mathematicians exclude non-analytic functions such as the absolute value function or discontinuous functions such as the step function, but others allow them. Some have proposed extending the set to include, for example, the Lambert W function.\nSome examples of functions that are \"not\" elementary:\nClosure.\nIt follows directly from the definition that the set of elementary functions is closed under arithmetic operations, root extraction and composition. The elementary functions are closed under differentiation. They are not closed under limits and infinite sums. Importantly, the elementary functions are closed under integration, as shown by Liouville's theorem, see nonelementary integral. The Liouvillian functions are defined as the elementary functions and, recursively, the integrals of the Liouvillian functions.\nDifferential algebra.\nThe mathematical definition of an elementary function, or a function in elementary form, is considered in the context of differential algebra. A differential algebra is an algebra with the extra operation of derivation (algebraic version of differentiation). Using the derivation operation new equations can be written and their solutions used in extensions of the algebra. By starting with the field of rational functions, two special types of transcendental extensions (the logarithm and the exponential) can be added to the field building a tower containing elementary functions.\nA differential field \"F\" is a field \"F\"0 (rational functions over the rationals Q for example) together with a derivation map \"u\"\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u2202\"u\". (Here \u2202\"u\" is a new function. Sometimes the notation \"u\"\u2032 is used.) The derivation captures the properties of differentiation, so that for any two elements of the base field, the derivation is linear\nand satisfies the Leibniz product rule\nAn element \"h\" is a constant if \"\u2202h\u00a0=\u00a00\". If the base field is over the rationals, care must be taken when extending the field to add the needed transcendental constants.\nA function \"u\" of a differential extension \"F\"[\"u\"] of a differential field \"F\" is an elementary function over \"F\" if the function \"u\""}
{"id": "10413", "revid": "42601261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10413", "title": "Enchiridion of Epictetus", "text": "The Enchiridion or Handbook of Epictetus (, \"Enkheir\u00eddion Epikt\u1e17tou\") is a short manual of Stoic ethical advice compiled by Arrian, a 2nd-century disciple of the Greek philosopher Epictetus. Although the content is mostly derived from the \"Discourses of Epictetus\", it is not a summary of the \"Discourses\" but rather a compilation of practical precepts. Eschewing metaphysics, Arrian focuses his attention on Epictetus's work applying philosophy to daily life. Thus, the book is a manual to show the way to achieve mental freedom and happiness in all circumstances.\nThe \"Enchiridion\" was well known in the ancient world, and in the medieval period, it was specially adapted for use in Greek-speaking monasteries. In the 15th century it was translated into Latin, and then, with the advent of printing, into multiple European languages. It reached the height of popularity in the 17th century, in parallel with the Neostoicism movement.\nTitle.\nThe word \"Enchiridion\" () is an adjective meaning \"in the hand\" or \"ready to hand\". The word sometimes meant a handy sword, or dagger, but coupled with the word \"book\" (\"biblion\", ) it means a handy book or hand-book. Epictetus in the \"Discourses\" often speaks of principles which his pupils should have \"ready to hand\" (). Common English translations of the title are Manual or Handbook.\nWriting.\nThe work consists of fifty-three short chapters typically consisting of a paragraph or two. It was compiled some time in the early 2nd century. The 6th-century philosopher Simplicius, in his \"Commentary\" on the work, refers to a letter written by Arrian which prefaced the text. In this letter Arrian stated that the \"Enchiridion\" was selected from the \"Discourses of Epictetus\" according to what he considered to be most useful, most necessary, and most adapted to move people's minds. Around half of the material in the \"Enchiridion\" has been shown to have been derived from the surviving four books of \"Discourses\" but variously modified. Other parts are presumed to be derived from the lost \"Discourses\". Some chapters appear to be reformulations of ideas which appear throughout the \"Discourses\".\nThere are some puzzles concerning the inclusion of two chapters. Chapter 29 is practically word for word identical with \"Discourse\" iii.\u00a015. Since it was omitted in one of the early Christian editions (\"Par\"), and not commented on by Simplicius, it may not have been in the original edition. Chapter 33 consists of a list of moral instructions, which are \"not obviously related to Epictetus' normal Stoic framework.\"\nThe current division of the work into fifty-three chapters was first adopted by Johann Schweigh\u00e4user in his 1798 edition; earlier editions tended to divide the text into more chapters (especially splitting chapter 33). Gerard Boter in his 1999 critical edition keeps Schweigh\u00e4user's fifty-three chapters but splits chapters 5, 14, 19, and 48 into two parts.\nContents.\nThe \"Enchiridion\" appears to be a loosely-structured selection of maxims. In his 6th-century \"Commentary\", Simplicius divided the text into four distinct sections suggesting a graded approach to philosophy:\nChapter 29, which was probably absent from the text used by Simplicius, is a one-page \"Discourse\" which compares the training needed to become a Stoic with the rigorous approach needed to become an Olympic victor.\nThemes.\nThe \"Enchiridion\" begins with the statement, \"Of things, some depend upon ourselves, others do not depend upon ourselves.\" So it starts with announcing that the business and concern of the real self is with matters subject to its own control, uninfluenced by external chance or change. Epictetus makes a sharp distinction between our own internal world of mental benefits and harms and the external world beyond our control. Freedom is to wish for nothing which is not up to ourselves. When we are tried by misfortune, we should never let our suffering overwhelm our sense of inward mastery and freedom.\nA constant vigilance is required, and one should never relax attention to one's reason, for it is judgements, not things, which disturb people.\nReason is the decisive principle in everything. Thus, we must exercise our power of assent over impressions and wish for nothing, nor avoid anything that is up to other people.\nTo a large extent, the \"Enchiridion\" suppresses many of the more amiable aspects of Epictetus, which can be found in the \"Discourses\", but this reflects the nature of the compilation. Some believe that, unlike the \"Discourses\" which seeks to encourage the student through argument and logic, the \"Enchiridion\" largely consists of a set of rules to follow. Others challenge this view, arguing that the chapters of the \"Enchiridion\" can be interpreted as containing arguments and articulating concepts that develop progressively throughout the work. The work is built on the conception that the wise person, by the aid of philosophy, may reap benefit from every experience in life. With proper training the student can flourish in adverse situations as well as favorable ones. The human spirit has capacities as yet undeveloped, but which it is for our good to develop. Thus, the book is a manual on how to make progress towards what is necessary and sufficient for happiness.\nEpictetus makes vivid use of imagery, and analogies include life depicted as: a ship's voyage (Ch. 7), an inn (Ch. 11), a banquet (Chs. 15, 36), and acting in a play (Ch. 17, 37). He takes many examples from everyday life, including: a broken jug (Ch. 3), a trip to the baths (Chs. 4, 43), his own lameness (Ch. 9), the loss of a child (Ch. 11), and the price of lettuce (Ch. 25).\nSubsequent history.\nFor many centuries, the \"Enchiridion\" maintained its authority both with Pagans and Christians. Simplicius of Cilicia wrote a commentary upon it in the 6th century, and in the Byzantine era Christian writers wrote paraphrases of it. Over one hundred manuscripts of the \"Enchiridion\" survive. The oldest extant manuscripts of the authentic \"Enchiridion\" date from the 14th century, but the oldest Christianised ones date from the 10th and 11th centuries, perhaps indicating the Byzantine world's preference for the Christian versions. The \"Enchiridion\" was first translated into Latin by Niccol\u00f2 Perotti in 1450, and then by Angelo Poliziano in 1479.\nThe first printed edition (\"editio princeps\") was Poliziano's Latin translation published in 1497. The original Greek was first published (somewhat abbreviated) with Simplicius's \"Commentary\" in 1528. The edition published by Johann Schweigh\u00e4user in 1798 was the major edition for the next two-hundred years. A critical edition was produced by Gerard Boter in 1999.\nThe separate editions and translations of the \"Enchiridion\" are very many. The \"Enchiridion\" reached its height of popularity in the period 1550\u20131750. It was translated into most European languages, and there were multiple translations in English, French, and German. The first English translation was by James Sandford in 1567 (a translation of a French version) and this was followed by a translation (from the Greek) by John Healey in 1610. The \"Enchiridion\" was even partly translated into Chinese by the Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci. The popularity of the work was assisted by the Neostoicism movement initiated by Justus Lipsius in the 16th century. Another Neostoic, Guillaume du Vair, translated the book into French in 1586 and popularised it in his \"La Philosophie morale des Stoiques\".\nIn the English-speaking world it was particularly well known in the 17th century: at that time it was the \"Enchiridion\" rather than the \"Discourses\" which was usually read. It was among the books John Harvard bequeathed to the newly founded Harvard College in 1638. The work, being written in a clear distinct style, made it accessible to readers with no formal training in philosophy, and there was a wide readership among women in England. The writer Mary Wortley Montagu made her own translation of the \"Enchiridion\" in 1710 at the age of twenty-one. The \"Enchiridion\" was a common school text in Scotland during the Scottish Enlightenment\u2014Adam Smith had a 1670 edition in his library, acquired as a schoolboy. At the end of the 18th century, the \"Enchiridion\" is attested in the personal libraries of Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson.\nIn the 19th century, Walt Whitman discovered the \"Enchiridion\" when he was about the age of sixteen. It was a book he would repeatedly return to, and late in life he called the book \"sacred, precious to me: I have had it about me so long\u2014lived with it in terms of such familiarity.\"\nThe \"Commentary\" of Simplicius.\nIn the 6th century the Neoplatonist philosopher Simplicius wrote a huge commentary on the \"Enchiridion\", which is more than ten times the bulk of the original text. Chapter after chapter of the \"Enchiridion\" is dissected, discussed, and its lessons drawn out with a certain laboriousness. Simplicius' commentary offers a distinctly Platonist vision of the world, one which is often at odds with the Stoic content of the \"Enchiridion\". Sometimes Simplicius exceeds the scope of a commentary; thus his commentary on \"Enchiridion\" 27 (Simplicius ch. 35) becomes a refutation of Manichaeism.\nThe \"Commentary\" enjoyed its own period of popularity in the 17th and 18th centuries. An English translation by George Stanhope in 1694 ran through four editions in the early 18th century. Edward Gibbon remarked in his \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" that Simplicius' \"Commentary\" on Epictetus \"is preserved in the library of nations, as a classic book\" unlike the commentaries on Aristotle \"which have passed away with the fashion of the times.\"\nChristian adaptations.\nThe \"Enchiridion\" was adapted three different times by Greek Christian writers. The oldest manuscript, \"Paraphrasis Christiana\" (\"Par\"), dates to the 10th century. Another manuscript, falsely ascribed to Nilus (\"Nil\"), dates to the 11th century. A third manuscript, Vaticanus gr. 2231 (\"Vat\"), dates to the 14th century. It is not known when the original versions of these manuscripts were first made.\nThese guides served as a rule and guide for monastic life. The most obvious changes are in the use of proper names: thus the name Socrates is sometimes changed to Paul. All three texts follow the \"Enchiridion\" quite closely, although the \"Par\" manuscript is more heavily modified: adding or omitting words, abridging or expanding passages, and occasionally inventing new passages.\nIn the 17th century the German monk Matthias Mittner did something similar, compiling a guide on mental tranquillity for the Carthusian Order by taking the first thirty-five of his fifty precepts from the \"Enchiridion\".\nNotes.\na. Gerard Boter in his 1999 critical edition catalogues 59 extant manuscripts of the \"Encheiridion\" proper, and another 27 manuscripts of Simplicius' \"Commentary\" which contain the \"Encheiridion\" as \"lemmata\" (headings). He also lists 37 Christianised manuscripts, (24 \"Par\", 12 \"Nil\", 1 \"Vat\"). Cf. "}

She was a daughter of Emperor Kinmei. Her mother was Soga no Iname's daughter, Soga no Kitashihime. Suiko was the younger sister of Emperor Y\u014dmei.\nBiography.\nEmpress Suiko was a consort to her half-brother, Emperor Bidatsu, but after Bidatsu's first wife died she became his official consort and was given the title \u014ckisaki (official consort of the emperor). She bore eight children.\nAfter Bidatsu's death, Suiko's brother, Emperor Y\u014dmei, came to power for about two years before dying of illness. Upon Y\u014dmei's death, another power struggle arose between the Soga clan and the Mononobe clan, with the Sogas supporting Prince Hatsusebe and the Mononobes supporting . The Sogas prevailed once again and Prince Hatsusebe acceded to the throne as Emperor Sushun in 587. However, Sushun began to resent the power of Soga no Umako, the head of the Soga clan, and Umako, perhaps out of fear that Sushun might strike first, had him assassinated by in 592. When asked to accede to the throne to fill the power vacuum that subsequently developed, Suiko became the first of what would be several examples in Japanese history where a woman was chosen to accede to the throne to avert a power struggle.\nSuiko's contemporary title would not have been \"tenn\u014d\", as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jit\u014d. Rather, it was presumably \"Sumeramikoto\" or \"Amenoshita Shiroshimesu \u014ckimi\" (\u6cbb\u5929\u4e0b\u5927\u738b), meaning \"the great Queen who rules all under heaven\".

Although political power during Suiko's reign is widely viewed as having been wielded by Prince Sh\u014dtoku and Soga no Umako, Suiko was far from powerless. The mere fact that she survived and her reign endured suggests she had significant political skills.\nIn 599, an earthquake destroyed buildings throughout Yamato Province in what is now Nara Prefecture.\nSuiko's refusal to grant Soga no Umako's request that he be granted the imperial territory known as Kazuraki no Agata in 624 is cited as evidence of her independence from his influence. Some of the many achievements under Empress Suiko's reign include the official recognition of Buddhism by the issuance of the Flourishing Three Treasures Edict in 594. Suiko was also one of the first Buddhist monarchs in Japan, and had taken the vows of a nun shortly before becoming empress.\nThe reign of this empress was marked by the opening of relations with the Sui court in 600, the adoption of the Twelve Level Cap and Rank System in 603 and the adoption of the Seventeen-article constitution in 604.\nThe adoption of the Sexagenary cycle calendar (\"Jikkan J\u016bnishi\") in Japan is attributed to Empress Suiko in 604.\nAt a time when imperial succession was generally determined by clan leaders rather than the emperor, Suiko left only vague indications of succession to two candidates while on her deathbed. One, Prince Tamura, was a grandson of Emperor Bidatsu and was supported by the main line of Sogas, including Soga no Emishi. The other, Prince Yamashiro, was a son of Prince Sh\u014dtoku and had the support of some lesser members of the Soga clan. After a brief struggle within the Soga clan in which one of Prince Yamashiro's main supporters was killed, Prince Tamura was chosen and he acceded to the throne as Emperor Jomei in 629.\nEmpress Suiko ruled for 35 years. Although there were seven other reigning empresses, their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century. Empress Genmei, who was followed on the throne by her daughter, Empress Gensh\u014d, remains the sole exception to this conventional argument.\nThe actual site of Suiko's grave is known. This empress is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Osaka.\nThe Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Suiko's mausoleum. It's formally named \"Shinaga no Yamada no misasagi\".\nBeginning of historical writing in Japan.\nSinologist Wm. Theodore de Bary believed that it was not until the reign of Suiko that \"consciously written [Japanese] history becomes a reality\". He noted the name Suiko can be translated to \"conjecture of the past\", suggesting that this posthumous title was \"bestowed on the empress because the writing of history was considered to be an outstanding achievement of her reign\". He commented that \"little of the material from the ancient Japanese past can be taken seriously\" and the earliest extant Japanese annals were the \"Kojiki\" and the \"Nihon Shoki\", which both date to the 8th century.\nSpouse and children.\nEmpress Suiko, born as Princess Nukatabe (\u984d\u7530\u90e8\u7687\u5973), was the daughter of Emperor Kinmei and his consort (Hi), Soga no Kitashihime.

When Naka no \u014ce's mother re-ascended, he continued in the role of her heir and crown prince. In this role, he could and did remain active in the political life of Japan.\nIn the fifth year of Saimei's reign, Paekche in Korea was destroyed in 660. Japan assisted Paekche loyals in an attempt to aid the revival of Paekche dynasty. Early in 661, Saimei responded to the situation by leaving her capital in Yamato Province. Her plan was to lead a military expedition to Korea. The empress stayed in Ishiyu Temporary Palace in Iyo Province, today D\u014dgo Onsen. In May she arrived at Asakura Palace in the north part of Tsukushi province in Ky\u016bsh\u016b, today a part of Fukuoka Prefecture. The allied army of Japan and Baekje was preparing for war against Silla, but the death of the empress thwarted those plans. In 661, Saimei died in the Asakura Palace before the army departed to Korea. In October her body was brought from Ky\u016bsh\u016b by sea to Port Naniwa-zu (today Osaka city); and her state funeral was held in early November.\nEmpress Saimei ruled for seven years.

He was a son of Chinu no \u014dkimi (Prince Chinu, \u8305\u6e1f\u738b) by Kibitsuhime no \u014dkimi (Princess Kibitsuhime, \u5409\u5099\u59eb\u738b). Empress K\u014dgyoku was his elder sister from the same parents. Chinu was a son of Prince Oshisaka hikohito no \u014de, whose father was the Emperor Bidatsu. He had at least three consorts including his Empress, Hashihito no Himemiko (Princess Hashihito), the daughter of Emperor Jomei and his sister Empress K\u014dgyoku. In the 3rd year of K\u014dgyoku\"-tenn\u014d\"s reign (\u7687\u6975\u5929\u7687\u4e09\u5e74), the empress abdicated; and the succession (\"senso\") was received by her younger brother. Shortly thereafter, Emperor K\u014dtoku is said to have acceded to the throne (\"sokui\").\nK\u014dtoku ruled from July 12, 645 (AD), until his death in 654. In 645, he ascended to the throne two days after Prince Naka no \u014ce (Emperor Tenji) assassinated Soga no Iruka in the court of K\u014dgyoku. K\u014dgyoku abdicated in favor of her son and crown prince, Naka no \u014ce, but Naka no \u014ce insisted K\u014dtoku should ascend to the throne instead. K\u014dtoku's contemporary title would not have been \"tenn\u014d\", as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jit\u014d. Rather, it was presumably \"Sumeramikoto\" or \"Amenoshita Shiroshimesu \u014ckimi\" (\u6cbb\u5929\u4e0b\u5927\u738b), meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven\". Alternatively, K\u014dtoku might have been referred to as (\u30e4\u30de\u30c8\u5927\u738b/\u5927\u541b) or the \"Great King of Yamato\". According to the \"Nihonshoki\", he was of gentle personality and was in favor of Buddhism.\nIn 645, he created a new city in the area called Naniwa, and moved the capital from Yamato Province to this new city (see Nara). The new capital had a seaport and was good for foreign trade and diplomatic activities. In 653, K\u014dtoku sent an envoy to the court of the Tang dynasty in China, but some of the ships were lost \"en route\".\nNaka no \u014ce held the rank of crown prince and was the \"de facto\" leader of the government. In 653 Naka no \u014ce proposed to move the capital again to Yamato province. K\u014dtoku denied. Naka no \u014ce ignored the emperor's policy and moved to the former province. Many courtiers of the court, including Empress Hashihito, followed him. K\u014dtoku was left in the palace. In the next year he died of an illness. After his death, Naka would not ascend to the throne. Instead, his mother and the sister of K\u014dtoku, the former Empress Kogyoku, ascended to the throne under another name, Empress Saimei.\nHe enacted the Taika Reform edicts. The system of \"hassh\u014d kyakkan\" (eight ministries and a hundred offices) was first established during the reign of Emperor K\u014dtoku.\nThe actual site of K\u014dtoku's grave is known.

Although the assassination did not go exactly as planned, Iruka was killed, and his father and predecessor, Soga no Emishi, committed suicide soon after. Following the Isshi Incident, Iruka's adherents dispersed largely without a fight, and Naka no \u014ce was named heir apparent.

He ascended to the throne following the Jinshin War, during which his army defeated that of Emperor K\u014dbun. Tenmu reigned from 673 until his death in 686, amid Hakuh\u014d period or the late Asuka period. \nDuring his reign, Tenmu implemented political and military reforms, consolidating imperial power and centralizing governance. His foreign policy favored the Korean kingdom\u00a0of Silla while severing diplomatic relations with the\u00a0Tang dynasty\u00a0of China. He used religious structures to bolster the imperial authority, building several Buddhist temples including Yakushi-ji and monasteries as well as strengthening ties with the Ise Shrine. He was succeeded by his wife, Empress Jit\u014d.\nTraditional narrative.\nTenmu was the youngest son of Emperor Jomei and Empress K\u014dgyoku, and the younger brother of the Emperor Tenji. His name at birth was . He was succeeded by Empress Jit\u014d, who was both his niece and his wife. During the reign of his elder brother, Emperor Tenji, Tenmu was forced to marry several of Tenji's daughters because Tenji thought those marriages would help to strengthen political ties between the two brothers. The nieces he married included Princess Unonosarara, today known as Empress Jit\u014d, and Princess \u014cta. Tenmu also had other consorts whose fathers were influential courtiers.\nTenmu had many children, including his crown prince Kusakabe by Princess Unonosarara; Princess T\u014dchi; Prince \u014ctsu and Princess \u014cku by Princess \u014cta (whose father also was Tenji); and Prince Toneri, the editor of the \"Nihon Shoki\" and father of Emperor Junnin. Through Prince Kusakabe, Tenmu had two emperors and two empresses among his descendants. Empress K\u014dken was the last of these imperial rulers from his lineage.\nEvents of Tenmu's life.\nEmperor Tenmu is the first monarch of Japan, to whom the title \"Tenn\u014d\" (Emperor of Japan) was assigned contemporaneously\u2014not only by later generations.\nThe only document on his life was \"Nihon Shoki\". However, it was edited by his son, Prince Toneri, and the work was written during the reigns of his wife and children, causing one to suspect its accuracy and impartiality. He is also mentioned briefly in the preface to the \"Kojiki\", being hailed as the emperor to have commissioned them.\nTenmu's father died while he was young, and he grew up mainly under the guidance of Empress Saimei. He was not expected to gain the throne, because his brother Tenji was the crown prince, being the older son of their mother, the reigning empress.\nDuring the Tenji period, Tenmu was appointed his crown prince. This was because Tenji had no appropriate heir among his sons at that time, as none of their mothers was of a rank high enough to give the necessary political support. Tenji was suspicious that Tenmu might be so ambitious as to attempt to take the throne, and felt the necessity to strengthen his position through politically advantageous marriages.\nTenji was particularly active in improving the military institutions which had been established during the Taika reforms.\nIn his old age, Tenji had a son, Prince \u014ctomo, by a low-ranking consort. Since \u014ctomo had weak political support from his maternal relatives, the general wisdom of the time held that it was not a good idea for him to ascend to the throne, yet Tenji was obsessed with the idea.\nIn 671 Tenmu felt himself to be in danger and volunteered to resign the office of crown prince to become a monk. He moved to the mountains in Yoshino, Yamato Province (now Yoshino, Nara), officially for reasons of seclusion. He took with him his sons and one of his wives, Princess Unonosarara, a daughter of Tenji. However, he left all his other consorts at the capital, Omiky\u014d in \u014cmi Province (today in \u014ctsu).\nA year later, (in 672) Tenji died and Prince \u014ctomo ascended to the throne as Emperor K\u014dbun. Tenmu assembled an army and marched from Yoshino to the east, to attack the capital of Omiky\u014d in a counterclockwise movement. They marched through Yamato, Iga and Mino Provinces to threaten Omiky\u014d in the adjacent province. The army of Tenmu and the army of the young Emperor K\u014dbun fought in the northwestern part of Mino (nowadays Sekigahara, Gifu), an incident known as the Jinshin War. Tenmu's army won and K\u014dbun committed suicide.\nAs might be expected, Emperor Tenmu was no less active than former-Emperor Tenji in improving the Taika military institutions. Tenmu's reign brought many changes, such as: (1) a centralized war department was organized; (2) the defenses of the Inner Country near the Capital were strengthened; (3) forts and castles were built near Capital and in the western parts of Honsh\u016b\u2014and in Kyushu; (4) troops were reviewed; and all provincial governors were ordered to complete the collection of arms and to study tactics.\nIn 673 Tenmu moved the capital back to Yamato on the Kiymihara plain, naming his new capital Asuka. The \"Man'y\u014dsh\u016b\" includes a poem written after the Jinshin War ended:\nAt Asuka, Emperor Tenmu was enthroned. He elevated Unonosarara to be his empress. Events of his reign include:\nTenmu reigned from this capital until his death in 686. His wife, Empress Jito became the emperor until their son became the 42nd Emperor. The actual site of his grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial shrine (\"misasagi\") in Nara Prefecture. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Tenmu's mausoleum. It is formally named \"Hinokuma no \u014cuchi no misasagi.\"\nBuddhism.\nIn 675 Emperor Tenmu banned the consumption of domesticated animal meat (horse, cattle, dogs, monkeys, birds), from April 1 to September 30 each year, due to the influence of Buddhism.\nPolitics.\nIn the \"Nihon Shoki\", Tenmu is described as a great innovator, but the neutrality of this description is doubtful, since the work was written under the control of his descendants. It seems clear, however, that Tenmu strengthened the power of the emperor and appointed his sons to the highest offices of his government, reducing the traditional influence of powerful clans such as the \u014ctomo and Soga clans. He renewed the system of \"kabane\", the hereditary titles of duty and rank, but with alterations, including the abolition of some titles. Omi and Muraji, the highest kabane in the earlier period, were reduced in value in the new hierarchy, which consisted of eight kinds of kabane. Each clan received a new kabane according to its closeness to the imperial bloodline and its loyalty to Tenmu.\nTenmu attempted to keep a balance of power among his sons. Once he traveled to Yoshino together with his sons, and there had them swear to cooperate and not to make war on each other. This turned out to be ineffective: one of his sons, Prince \u014ctsu, was later executed for treason after the death of Tenmu.\nTenmu's foreign policy favored the Korean kingdom Silla, which took over the entire Korean peninsula in 676. After the unification of Korea by Silla, Tenmu decided to break diplomatic relations with the Tang dynasty of China, evidently in order to keep on good terms with Silla.\nTenmu used religious structures to increase the authority of the imperial throne. During his reign there was increased emphasis on the tie between the imperial household and Ise Grand Shrine (dedicated to the ancestor goddess of the emperors, Amaterasu) by sending his daughter Princess \u014cku as the newly established Sai\u014d of the shrine, and several festivals were financed from the national budget. He also showed favor to Buddhism, and built several large temples and monasteries. It is said that Tenmu asked that each household was encouraged to build an altar with a dais where a Buddha-image and a sutra could be placed so that family worshiping could be held, thus inventing the butsudan. On the other hand, all Buddhist priests, monks and nuns were controlled by the state, and no one was allowed to become a monk without the state's permission. This was aimed at preventing cults and stopping farmers from turning into priests.\n\"Kugy\u014d\".\n\"Kugy\u014d\" () is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.\nIn general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.

The two female monarchs before Jit\u014d were Suiko and K\u014dgyoku/Saimei. The five women sovereigns reigning after Jit\u014d were Genmei, Gensh\u014d, K\u014dken/Sh\u014dtoku, Meish\u014d, and Go-Sakuramachi.\nTraditional narrative.\nEmpress Jit\u014d was the daughter of Emperor Tenji. Her mother was Ochi-no-Iratsume, the daughter of Minister \u014c-omi Soga no Yamada-no Ishikawa Maro. She was the wife of Tenji's full brother Emperor Tenmu, whom she succeeded on the throne.\nEmpress Jit\u014d's given name was , or alternately Uno.\nEvents of Jit\u014d's reign.\nJit\u014d took responsibility for court administration after the death of her husband, Emperor Tenmu, who was also her uncle. She acceded to the throne in 687 in order to ensure the eventual succession of her son, Kusakabe-shinn\u014d. Throughout this period, Empress Jit\u014d ruled from the Fujiwara Palace in Yamato. In 689, Jit\u014d prohibited \"Sugoroku\", in 690 at enthronement she performed special ritual then gave pardon and in 692 she travelled to Ise against the counsel of minister Miwa-no-Asono-Takechimaro.\nPrince Kusakabe was named as crown prince to succeed Jit\u014d, but he died at a young age. Kusakabe's son, Karu-no-o, was then named as Jit\u014d's successor. He eventually would become known as Emperor Monmu.\nEmpress Jit\u014d reigned for eleven years. Although there were seven other reigning empresses, their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century. Empress Genmei, who was followed on the throne by her daughter, Empress Gensh\u014d, remains the sole exception to this conventional argument.\nIn 697, Jit\u014d abdicated in Monmu's favor; and as a retired sovereign, she took the post-reign title \"daij\u014d-tenn\u014d\". After this, her imperial successors who retired took the same title after abdication.\nJit\u014d continued to hold power as a cloistered ruler, which became a persistent trend in Japanese politics.\nThe actual site of Jit\u014d's grave is known.

Her reign spanned the years 715 through 724.\nGensh\u014d was the fifth of eight women to take on the role of empress regnant, and the only one in the history of Japan to have inherited her title from another empress regnant rather than from a male predecessor. The four female monarchs before Gensh\u014d were Suiko, K\u014dgyoku, Jit\u014d and Genmei; the three reigning after her were K\u014dken, Meish\u014d, and Go-Sakuramachi.\nTraditional narrative.\nBefore her ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, her personal name (\"imina\") was Hidaka\"-hime\".\nGensh\u014d was an elder sister of Emperor Monmu and daughter of Prince Kusakabe and his wife who later became Empress Genmei. Therefore, she was a granddaughter of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jit\u014d by her father and a granddaughter of Emperor Tenji through her mother.\nEvents of Gensh\u014d's life.\nEmpress Gensh\u014d's succession to the throne was intended as a regency until Prince Obito, the son of her deceased younger brother Monmu, was mature enough to ascend the throne. Obito would later become the Emperor Sh\u014dmu.\nObito was appointed Crown Prince in 714 by Empress Genmei. In the next year, 715, Empress Genmei, then in her fifties, abdicated in favor of her daughter Gensh\u014d. Obito was then 14 years old.\nObito remained the crown prince, heir to the new empress. Fujiwara no Fuhito, the most powerful courtier in Genmei's court, remained at his post until his death in 720. After his death, Prince Nagaya, a grandson of Tenmu and the Empress Gensh\u014d's cousin, seized power. This power shift was a background for later conflicts between Nagaya and Fuhito's four sons during the reign of Emperor Sh\u014dmu (formerly Prince Obito).\nUnder Gensh\u014d's reign, the \"Nihon Shoki\" was finished in 720. Organization of the law system known as the \"ritsury\u014d\" was continued under the initiatives of Fuhito until his death. These laws and codes were edited and enacted by Fujiwara no Nakamaro, a grandson of Fuhito, and published as \"Y\u014dr\u014d ritsury\u014d\" under the name of Fuhito. The taxation system which had been introduced by Empress Jit\u014d in the late 7th century began to malfunction. To compensate for the decreased tax revenue, the \"Act of possession in three generations\", an initiative of Prince Nagaya, was enacted in 723. Under this act, people were allowed to possess a newly cultivated field once every three generations. In the fourth generation, the right of possession would revert to the national government. This act was intended to motivate new cultivation, but it only remained in effect for about 20 years.\nEmpress Gensh\u014d reigned for nine years. Although there were seven other reigning empresses, their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century. Empress Genmei, who was succeeded by her daughter, remains the sole exception to this conventional argument.\nIn 724, Gensh\u014d abdicated in favor of her nephew, who would be known as Emperor Sh\u014dmu. Gensh\u014d lived for 25 years after she stepped down from the throne. She never married and had no children. She died at age 65.\nEmpress Gensh\u014d's grave is located in Nara. This empress is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\"), also in Nara.

Both her reigns occurred during the Nara period.\nThe daughter of Emperor Sh\u014dmu, Empress K\u014dken succeeded to the throne at the age of 31, following her father's renunciation. She first reigned from 749 to 758. During this period, the government was heavily influenced by her mother, the former empress consort K\u014dmy\u014d, and the latter's nephew, Fujiwara no Nakamaro. She was eventually replaced on the throne by her relative, Emperor Junnin, whose rule was a continuation of Nakamaro's regime. During the intermediate period of her reigns, the retired empress K\u014dken is said to have become close to a monk without a noble background, named D\u014dky\u014d, by 762. Their precise relationship remains a mystery, although there is a common version that it was romantic. The retired empress had taken Buddhist oaths and became a nun, but retained a decisive role in politics. \nAfter K\u014dmy\u014d's death in July 760, the growing power struggle between K\u014dken's and Nakamaro's opposing factions became increasingly inevitable. Following the suppression of the Fujiwara no Nakamaro Rebellion and his murder, K\u014dken reascended the throne as Empress Sh\u014dtoku in 764 and ruled until her death in 770, concentrating the government into her own hands. D\u014dky\u014d was appointed Grand Minister within a year. In 766, he was promoted to H\u014d\u014d (priestly emperor) and in around 769 tried to ascend the throne himself, which led to a scandal; this was one of few recorded instances when there was an attempt to end the imperial dynasty. The death of the empress, presumably from smallpox, and resistance from the aristocracy destroyed his plans. This incident was a reason for the later move of the Japanese capital from Nara (Heij\u014d). Empress K\u014dken was one of the most politically powerful women in Japanese history: subsequent empresses were only ritual rulers, while the government was dominated by the shoguns (military dictators).\nIn the history of Japan, K\u014dken/Sh\u014dtoku was the sixth of eight women to take on the role of empress regnant. The five female monarchs before her were Suiko, K\u014dgyoku/Saimei, Jit\u014d, Genmei and Gensh\u014d, and the two women sovereigns reigning after K\u014dken/Sh\u014dtoku were Meish\u014d and Go-Sakuramachi.\nTraditional narrative.\nEmpress K\u014dken's personal name (\"imina\") was . Her father was Emperor Sh\u014dmu, and her mother was Empress K\u014dmy\u014d.\nK\u014dken is traditionally venerated at her tomb; the Imperial Household Agency designates , in Nara, Nara, as the location of K\u014dken's mausoleum. The site is publicly accessible.\nEras of her reigns.\nThe years of K\u014dken's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name.\nThe years of Sh\u014dtoku's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name.\nLegacy.\nKoken's reign was turbulent, and she survived coup attempts by both Tachibana no Naramaro and Fujiwara no Nakamaro. Today, she is remembered chiefly for her alleged affair with a Buddhist monk named D\u014dky\u014d (\u9053\u93e1), a man she honored with titles and power. An oracle from Usa Shrine, the shrine of the kami in Usa, is said to have proclaimed that the monk should be made emperor; but when the empress sent to verify the pronouncement, Hachiman decreed that only one of imperial blood should ascend to the throne.\nAs with the seven other reigning empresses whose successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal imperial bloodline, she was followed on the throne by a male cousin, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century. Empress Genmei, who was followed on the throne by her daughter, Empress Gensh\u014d, remains the sole exception to this conventional argument.\nShe is also known for sponsoring the Hyakumant\u014d Darani, one of the largest productions of printed works in early Japan.\nOtagi Nenbutsu-ji, a Buddhist temple in the Arashiyama neighborhood of Kyoto, was founded by Sh\u014dtoku in the middle of the eighth century.\nKugy\u014d.\n is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.\nIn general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.

In 764, six years after Empress K\u014dken had abdicated, the former empress reclaimed the throne during Fujiwara no Nakamaro's Rebellion, forcing Junnin to abdicate.\nDeath and mausoleum.\nOn November 10, 765 (\"Tenpy\u014d-jingo 1, 23rd day of the 10th month\"), the former emperor died while in exile. The official cause of death was illness, but according to one theory, it was the assassination by the order of Emperor Sh\u014dtoku. The site of Junnin's actual grave is unknown, and he is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Awaji. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Junnin's mausoleum: It is formally named \"Awaji no misasagi\".\nThough Junnin had, technically, been emperor, he was not featured on the official List of Japanese Emperors until the late nineteenth century. In 1870, Emperor Meiji conferred the posthumous name and title by which Emperor Junnin is now known.

At the time the retired Heizei had quarreled with his brother over the ideal location of the court, the latter preferring the Heian capital, while the former was convinced that a shift back to the Nara plain was necessary, and Heizei, exploiting Saga's weakened health, seized the opportunity to foment a rebellion, known historically as the Kusuko Incident; however, forces loyal to Emperor Saga, led by \"taish\u014dgun\" Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, quickly defeated the Heizei rebels which thus limited the adverse consequences which would have followed any broader conflict. This same Tamuramaro is remembered in Aomori's annual Nebuta Matsuri which feature a number of gigantic, specially-constructed, illuminated paper floats. These great lantern-structures are colorfully painted with mythical figures; and teams of men carry them through the streets as crowds shout encouragement. This early ninth century military leader is commemorated in this way because he is said to have ordered huge illuminated lanterns to be placed at the top of hills; and when the curious Emishi approached these bright lights to investigate, they were captured and subdued by Tamuramaro's men.\nEras of Saga's reign.\nThe years of Saga's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name (\"neng\u014d\").\nLegacy.\nIn ancient Japan, there were four noble clans, the \"Gempeit\u014dkitsu\" (\u6e90\u5e73\u85e4\u6a58).

Very little is known about this Emperor due to a lack of material available for further verification and study. Suizei is known as a \"legendary emperor\" among historians as his actual existence is disputed. A legendary account from the \"Kojiki\" states that Suizei became emperor after receiving the title of crown prince by his half brother due to his bravery regarding a murder plot. Suizei's reign started in 581 BC, he had one wife and a sole son who supposedly became the next emperor upon his death in 549 BC.\nLegendary narrative.\nWhile the \"Kojiki\" provides little information about Suizei, it does state his name, genealogy, and a record about his accession to the throne. He was born sometime in 632 BC, and was one of the sons of Emperor Jimmu and his chief wife Himetataraisuzu-hime. The account in the Kojiki states that Suizei's older brother Kamuyaimimi was originally the Crown-prince. When Jimmu died, another of his sons named Tagishimimi attempted to seize the throne by murdering those in his way. Tagishimimi was given birth to by a lesser wife named Ahiratsu-hime, and was older than Jimmu's legitimate heir. When Himetataraisuzu-hime learned of the plot she tried in vain to warn her sons by way of songs and poems. While Suizei encouraged Kamuyaimimi to slay Tagishimimi, he could not find it in him to murder his own half brother. Suizei pleaded with his older brother for the weapon he was going to use, and upon receiving it accomplished the deed for him. Kamuyaimimi ceded his rights as crown prince shortly after to Suizei as he believed his braver younger brother should be the new Emperor.\nEmperor Suizei's pre-ascension name remains unknown, but the \"Kojiki\" records that he ruled from the palace of at Katsuragi in what would come to be known as Yamato Province. While another more expansive account exists in the \"Nihon Shoki\", the section is more steeped in myth. Suizei is conventionally considered to have reigned from 581 to 549 BC. He wed Isuzuyori-hime at an unknown date, and the two had one son. Emperor Suizei allegedly died in 549 BC and his gravesite is formally named \"Tsukida no oka no e no misasagi\". He was succeeded by his only son, \"Prince Shikitsuhikotamatemi\" who became Emperor Annei.\nKnown information.\nThe existence of at least the first nine Emperors is disputed due to insufficient material available for further verification and study. Suizei is thus regarded by historians as a \"legendary Emperor\", and is ranked as the first of eight Emperors without specific legends associated with them. The name Suizei\"-tenn\u014d\" was assigned to him posthumously by later generations, and literally means \"joyfully healthy peace\". His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Suizei, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the \"Kojiki\". While the actual site of his grave is not known, an Imperial \"misasagi\" or tomb for Suizei is currently maintained in Kashihara. The first emperor that historians state might have actually existed is Emperor Sujin, the 10th emperor of Japan.

While Sujin is the first emperor whose existence historians widely accept, he is still referred to as a \"legendary emperor\" due to a lack of information available and because dates for his reign vary. Both the , and the (collectively known as the \"Kiki\") record events that took place during Sujin's alleged lifetime. This legendary narrative tells how he set up a new shrine outside of the Imperial palace to enshrine Amaterasu. He is also credited with initiating the worship of \u014cmononushi (equated with the deity of Mount Miwa), and expanding his empire by sending generals to four regions of Japan in what became known as the legend of \"Shid\u014d shogun\".\nThis Emperor's reign is conventionally assigned the years of 97 BC\u00a0\u2013 30 BC. During his alleged lifetime, he fathered twelve children with a chief wife (empress) and two consorts. Sujin chose his future heir based on dreams two of his sons had; in this case, his younger son became Emperor Suinin upon Sujin's death in 30 BC. Like other emperors of this period, the location of Sujin's grave if it exists is unknown. He is traditionally venerated at the Andonyama kofun in Tenri, Nara.\nLegendary narrative.\nThe Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence, and a kofun (tumulus) for Sujin is currently maintained. There remains no conclusive evidence though that supports this historical figure actually reigning. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical and , which are collectively known as or \"Japanese chronicles\". These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. The records state that Sujin was born sometime in 148 BC, and was the second son of Emperor Kaika. Sujin's mother was \"Ikagashikome no Mikoto\", who was also a concubine of Sujin's grandfather Emperor K\u014dgen. Before he was enthroned sometime in 97 BC, his pre-ascension name was either Prince \"Mimakiirihikoinie no Mikoto\", \"Mimakiiribikoinie no Sumeramikoto\", or \"Hatsukunishirasu Sumeramikoto\". The former name is used in the , while the latter two are found in the . Sujin was enthroned sometime in 97 BC, and during the 3rd year of his reign it is the recorded that he moved the capital to , naming it the \"Palace of Mizu-gaki\" or .\nEnshrining \u014cmononushi (Miwa My\u014djin).\nThe \"Kiki\" records that pestilence struck during the 5th year of Sujin's rule, killing half the Japanese population. The following year peasants abandoned their fields and rebellion became rampant. To help relieve the suffering of his people, the Emperor turned his attention towards the gods. At the time, both the sun goddess Amaterasu and the god were enshrined at the Imperial Residence. Sujin became overwhelmed with having to cohabit with these two powerful deities and set up separate enshrinements to house them. Amaterasu was moved to in Yamato Province (Nara), where a Himorogi altar was built out of solid stone. Sujin placed his daughter in charge of the new shrine, and she would become the first Sai\u014d. Yamato-no-Okunitama (the other god) was entrusted to another daughter named , but her health began to fail shortly afterward. It is recorded that Nunakiiri-hime became emaciated after losing all of her hair, which rendered her unable to perform her duties. These events still did not alleviate the ongoing plague sweeping the empire, so Sujin decreed a divination to be performed sometime during the 7th year of his reign. The divination involved him making a trip to the plain of Kami-asaji or , and invoking the eight hundred myriad deities.\nSujin's aunt (daughter of 7th Emperor Emperor K\u014drei) acted as a \"miko\", and was possessed by a god who identified himself as \u014cmononushi. This god claimed responsibility for the plague, announcing that it would not stop until he was venerated. Although the Emperor propitiated to the god, the effects were not immediate. Sujin was later given guidance in the form of a dream to seek out a man named and appoint him as head priest. When he was found and installed, the pestilence eventually subsided, allowing five cereal crops to ripen. Out of an abundance of caution, the Emperor also appointed as , or one who sorts the offerings to the gods. To this day the Miwa sect of the Kamo clan claim to be descents from , while Ikagashikoo was a claimed ancestor of the now extinct Mononobe clan.\nFour Cardinal Quarters (Shid\u014d shogun).\nIn his 10th year of rule, Sujin instituted four of his Generals to the \"Four Cardinal Quarters\" in what would be known as the \"Shid\u014d shogun\". These areas (west, north/northwest, northeast, and east) were all centered around the capital in Yamato Province. Sujin instructed his generals (shogun) to quell those who would not submit to their rule. One of the four shoguns who had been sent to the northern region was named , who was also Emperor K\u014dgen's first son. One day a certain maiden approached \u014chiko and sang him a cryptic song, only to disappear afterwards. Sujin's aunt , who was skilled at clairvoyance, interpreted this to mean that Take-hani-yasu-hiko (\u014chiko's half brother) was plotting an insurrection. Yamatototohimomoso-hime pieced it together from overhearing news that Take-hani-yasu-hiko's wife (Ata-bime) came to , and took a clump of earth in the corner of her neckerchief.\nEmperor Sujin gathered his generals in a meeting upon hearing the news, but the couple had already mustered troops to the west who were ready to attack the capital. The Emperor responded by sending an army under the command of general \"Isaseri-hiko no Mikoto\" to fight a battle that ended with a decisive Imperial victory. Ata-bime was killed in combat, and her husband fled back north. Sujin then sent general north to Yamashiro Province to punish the rebel prince. There was ultimately an exchange of bowshots that resulted in Take-hani-yasu-hiko's death by an arrow through the chest. Eventually the Emperor would appoint 137 governors for the provinces under his Imperial rule as the empire expanded. In his 12th year of rule, the Emperor decreed that a census be taken of the populace \"with grades of seniority, and the order of forced labour\". The tax system meanwhile was set up so taxes imposed were in the form of mandatory labor. These taxes were known as for men and for women. During this period peace and prosperity ensued, and the Emperor received the title .\nChoosing an heir and Divine treasures.\nDuring the 48th year of Sujin's reign (50 BC), he summoned two of his sons saying that he loved them equally and could not make up his mind which to make his heir. He then asked his sons to describe the dreams they had recently, so he could divine their lot by interpreting them. The elder son's name was , and explained to his father that he dreamt of climbing Mt. Mimoro (Mount Miwa). While facing east, he said that he thrust his spear eight times and then waved his sword eight times skywards. The younger prince, whose name was dreamt of climbing Mimoro and spanning ropes on four sides. He went on to say how he chased the sparrows that ate the millet. Sujin accordingly chose his younger son Ikume to become the next Crown prince, while his older son Toyoki was chosen to govern the east. Toyoki ultimately became the ancestor of the Kamitsuke and Shimotsuke clans.\nIn the 60th year of Sujin's reign (38 BC), Sujin told his ministers that he wanted to look at divine treasures brought from the heavens by which were housed in the Izumo Shrine. was the keeper of the treasures, but at the time was away on business in Tsukushi Province. Furune's younger brother , accommodated the Imperial Edict on his behalf by sending his two younger brothers as carriers of these treasures to show the Emperor. When Furune returned, he was furious at Iiirine for parting with the treasures. He invited his younger brother to wade in a pool (named Yamuya) with him, where he used a sword-swapping intrigue. Furune exchanged his own wooden sword with his brother's real sword and commenced a battle which ended with Iiirine's death. When the Imperial court received news of the event, they dispatched two generals to slay Izumo Furune.\nLater reign and death.\nTowards the end of his reign in (36 BC), both the and records indicate that Sujin started to encourage the building of artificial ponds and canals. During this time, was built near in Sumiyoshi-ku, Osaka. Sujin is also credited with building which was said to be located in \"Karu\" (Kashihara, Nara). During his alleged lifetime, Sujin fathered twelve children with a chief wife (empress) and two consorts. When he died in 30 BC, his son \"Prince Ikumeirihikoisachi\" became the next emperor per Sujin's choice. Sujin's actual burial site is unknown, but is said to be at Mount Miwa.\nHistorical figure.\nWhile Emperor Sujin is the first emperor whom historians state might have actually existed, he is not confirmed as an actual historical figure. Like his predecessors, his reign is disputed due to insufficient material available for further verification and study. Sujin's possible lifespan has been suggested to be as early as the 1st century AD, to as late as the fourth century AD, this is well past his conventionally assigned reign of 97 BC\u00a0\u2013 30 BC. Like Emperor K\u014dsh\u014d, Emperor K\u014drei, and Emperor Kaika, historian Louis Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric notes an idea in his book \"Japan Encyclopedia\" that Sujin could have lived in the 1st century (AD). This remains disputed though, especially among researchers who have been critical of his book. If Sujin did in fact exist, then he may have been the founder of the imperial dynasty. Historian Richard Ponsonby-Fane suggests that Sujin may have been the first emperor to perform a census and establish and regularize a system of taxation.\nIn either case (fictional or not), the name Sujin\"-tenn\u014d\" was assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Sujin, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the . Sujin's longevity was also written down by later compilers, who may have unrealistically extended his age to fill in time gaps. While the actual site of Sujin's grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at the \"Andonyama kofun\" in Tenri, Nara. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as the kofun (tumulus), and its formal name is \"\"Yamanobe no michi no Magari no oka no e no misasagi\". Sujin's kofun is one of six that are present in the area; the mounds are thought to have built sometime between 250 and 350 AD.\nOutside of the , the reign of Emperor Kinmei (\u00a0\u2013 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as \"traditional\" though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.

Less is known about \"Suinin\" than his father, and likewise he is also considered to be a \"legendary emperor\". Both the \"Kojiki\", and the \"Nihon Shoki\" (collectively known as the \"Kiki\") record events that took place during Suinin's alleged lifetime. This legendary narrative tells how he ordered his daughter Yamatohime-no-mikoto to establish a new permanent shrine for Amaterasu (the Sun Goddess), which eventually became known as the Ise Grand Shrine. Other events that were recorded concurrently with his reign include the origins of Sumo wrestling in the form of a wrestling match involving Nomi no Sukune.\nSuinin's reign is conventionally considered to have been from 29 BC to AD 70. During his alleged lifetime, he fathered seventeen children with two chief wives (empress) and six consorts. One of his sons became the next emperor upon his death in 70 AD, but the location of his father's grave (if any) is unknown. Suinin is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto tomb (\"misasagi\") at Nishi-machi, Amagatsuji, Nara City.\nLegendary narrative.\nThe Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Suinin is currently maintained. There remains no conclusive evidence though that supports this historical figure actually reigning. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\", which are collectively known as or \"Japanese chronicles\". These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. The records state that Suinin was born sometime in 69 BC, and was the third son of Emperor Sujin. Suinin's empress mother was named Mimaki-hime, who is also former Emperor K\u014dgen's daughter. Before he was enthroned sometime in 29 BC, his pre-ascension name was Prince \"Ikumeiribikoisachi no Sumeramikoto\". He appears to have ascended the throne a year before his father's death in 30 BC, and ruled from the palace of at Makimuku in what later became Yamato Province.\nSuinin is best known for events that surround the founding of the Ise Grand Shrine. The \"Nihon Shoki\" states that around 2,000 years ago the Emperor ordered his daughter Yamatohime-no-mikoto, to find a permanent location to worship the goddess Amaterasu-\u014dmikami (the Sun Goddess). Yamatohime searched for 20 years before settling on a location in Ise, where she established Naiku, the Inner Shrine. She is said to have chosen the location after she heard the voice of Amaterasu say; \"(Ise) is a secluded and pleasant land. In this land I wish to dwell.\" Amaterasu had previously been enshrined and worshipped in Kasanui, which was set up by Suinin's father in an attempt to alleviate a devastating plaque. The \"Kojiki\" records that during the reign of Emperor Suinin, the first \"Sai\u014d\" (High Priestess) was appointed for Ise Grand Shrine. This recording is also noted by \"Jien\", who was a 13th-century historian and poet. This remains disputed though, as the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b (The Anthology of Ten Thousand Leaves) states that the first Sai\u014d to serve at Ise was Princess \u014cku. If the latter is true then it would date the Sai\u014d appointments to the reign of Emperor Tenmu (\u00a0\u2013 686 AD).\nThere were other events during Suinin's reign as well that include an Asama Shrine tradition regarding Mount Fuji. The earliest veneration of Konohanasakuya-hime at the base of the mountain was said to be during the 3rd year of Emperor Suinin's reign. The \"Nihon Shoki\" also records a wrestling match in which \"Nomi no Sukune\" and \"Taima no Kehaya\" held during his era, as the origin of \"Sumai\" (Sumo wrestling). Meanwhile, Emperor Suinin's family grew to consist of 17 children with eight variously ranked wives. One of his consorts named \"Kaguya-hime-no-Mikoto\", is mentioned in the \"Kojiki\" as a possible basis for the legend of Kaguya-hime regarding the couple's love story. Emperor Suinin died in 70 AD at the age of 138, and his son Prince \"Ootarashihikoosirowake\" was enthroned as the next emperor the following year.\nKnown information.\nEmperor Suinin is regarded by historians as a \"legendary Emperor\" as there is insufficient material available for further verification and study. Unlike Emperor Sujin, there is less known about Suinin to possibly support his existence. In either case (fictional or not), the name Suinin\"-tenn\u014d\" was assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Suinin, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the \"Kojiki\". Suinin's longevity was also written down by later compilers, who may have unrealistically extended his age to fill in time gaps. While the actual site of Suinin's grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Nishi-machi, Amagatsuji, Nara City. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Suinin's mausoleum, and is formally named \"Sugawara no Fushimi no higashi no misasagi\".\nWhile the Ise Grand Shrine is traditionally said to have been established in the 1st century BC, other dates in the 3rd and 4th centuries have also been put forward for the establishment of Naik\u016b and Gek\u016b respectively. The first shrine building at Naik\u016b was allegedly erected by Emperor Tenmu (678\u2013686), with the first ceremonial rebuilding being carried out by his wife, Empress Jit\u014d, in 692. Outside of the Kiki, the reign of Emperor Kinmei (\u00a0\u2013 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as \"traditional\" though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.\nConsorts and children.\nEmperor Suinin had two chief wives (aka Empress), it is recorded in the Kiki that the first empress was named Saho. Not much is known about her other than that her father was Emperor Kaika's son and she allegedly died sometime in 34 AD. As with the first empress there is also not much known about Suinin's second chief wife Hibasu. She was the daughter Prince Tanba-no-Michinoushi, who was Prince Hikoimasu's son and Emperor Kaika's grandson. Hibasu's third son later became known as Emperor Keik\u014d (the next emperor), she allegedly died sometime in 61 AD. Suinin also had six named consorts with an additional one remaining unknown.

Both the \"Kojiki\", and the \"Nihon Shoki\" (collectively known as the \"Kiki\") record events that took place during Keik\u014d's alleged lifetime. Keik\u014d was recorded as being an exceptionally tall emperor who had a very large family. During his reign he sought to expand territorial control through conquest of local tribes. He had a very important son named \"Prince \u014csu\" (Yamato Takeru), who was in possession of the Kusanagi when he died. This treasure was later moved to Atsuta Shrine, and is now a part of the Imperial Regalia of Japan. There is a possibility that Keik\u014d actually lived or reigned in the 4th century AD rather than the 1st, but more information is needed to confirm this view.\nKeik\u014d's reign is conventionally considered to have been from 71 to 130 AD. During his alleged lifetime, he fathered at least 80 children with two chief wives (empress) and nine consorts. One of his sons became the next emperor upon his death in 130 AD, but the location of Keik\u014d's grave (if any) is unknown. Keik\u014d is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto tomb (\"misasagi\") at Nara.\nLegendary narrative.\nThe Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Keiko is currently maintained.

These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. The records state that Keik\u014d was born sometime in 13 BC, and was given the name \"Otarashihiko-no-mikoto\". He was the 3rd son of Emperor Suinin, and his second empress wife \"\". Otarashihiko-no-mikoto was allegedly chosen as crown prince over his elder brother based on a casual question on what they both had wished for. In the former's case he said \"The Empire\" while his elder brother said \"Bow and arrows\". Otarashihiko-no-mikoto later ascended to the throne in 71 AD, coming a year after his father's death.\nAccounts in the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\" are split when it comes to initial territorial expansion during Emperor Keik\u014d's reign. In the \"Kojiki\", the Emperor is said to have sent his son \"Prince \u014csu\" (Yamato Takeru) to Ky\u016bsh\u016b to conquer local tribes. Alternatively, the \"Nihon Shoki\" records that he went there himself and won battles against local tribes. Both sources agree that Keik\u014d later sent Yamato Takeru to Izumo Province, and eastern provinces to conquer the area and spread his territory. According to traditional sources, Yamato Takeru died in the . The possessions of the dead prince were gathered together along with the sword Kusanagi; and his widow venerated his memory in a shrine at her home. Sometime later, these relics and the sacred sword were moved to the current location of the Atsuta Shrine.\nEmperor Keik\u014d was recorded as , who had at least 80 children from multiple wives. This claim would put him into the category of gigantism if verified, although as with other aspects it was more than likely exaggerated. Other than Yamato Takeru, at least three of Keik\u014d's children were ancestors of notable clans. According to tradition, emperor Keik\u014d died in 130 AD at the age of 143, and his son Prince \"Wakatarashihiko\" was enthroned as the next emperor the following year.\nKnown information.\nEmperor Keik\u014d is regarded by historians as a \"legendary Emperor\" as there is insufficient material available for further verification and study. The name Keik\u014d\"-tenn\u014d\" was assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Keik\u014d, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the \"Kojiki\". There is a possibility that Keik\u014d's era was in the 4th century AD rather than the 1st. This period is concurrent with the Kentoshi having an audience with the Tang Emperor, more evidence is needed though to make any conclusions. Like his father before him, Keik\u014d is also known to have an exaggerated lifespan which is unlikely to be factual. The consecutive reigns of the emperors began to be compiled in the 8th century, and it is thought that age gaps were \"filled up\" as many lacunae were present. For comparison, verified ages in the 110s have since been documented and recorded as the \"oldest in the world\".\nWhile the actual site of Keik\u014d's grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Nara. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Keik\u014d's mausoleum, and is formally named \"Yamanobe no michi no e no misasagi\". Outside of the \"Kiki\", the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( \u2013 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as \"traditional\" though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.\nConsorts and children.\nEmperor Keik\u014d allegedly had a very large family which consisted of 2 wives, 9 concubines, and more than 80 children (51 of which are listed here). It is now questionable and open to debate though, if these numbers are genuine or not. Some of his listed children might actually be duplicates of the same person. The size of Keik\u014d's family also could have been exaggerated over time through legends and word of mouth stories.\nFurther reading.\n "}

Both the \"Kojiki\", and the \"Nihon Shoki\" (collectively known as the \"Kiki\") record events that took place during Seimu's alleged lifetime. This legendary Emperor is best known for organizing his local governments by making the first appointments of their kind to provinces under his rule. Seimu had only one recorded wife who bore him a single child; he also had a concubine but she had no children. This is in stark contrast to his father, who is said to have had at least 80 children with multiple wives.\nSeimu's reign is conventionally considered to have been from 131 to 190 AD. An issue ultimately occurred when his only son allegedly died at a young age. Seimu appointed one of his nephews to be crown prince before his death in 190 AD, marking the first of later generations which would cede the throne to a non-direct successor. While the location of Seimu's grave (if any) is unknown, he is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto tomb. Modern historians have come to the conclusion that the title of \"Emperor\" and the name \"Seimu\" was used by later generations to describe this legendary Emperor. It has also been proposed that Seimu actually reigned much later than he is attested.\nLegendary narrative.\nThe Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Seimu is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\", which are collectively known as or \"Japanese chronicles\". These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. The records state that Seimu was born to sometime in 84 AD, and was given the name . It is unknown how he was chosen as crown prince, but Wakatarashihiko later ascended to the throne in 131 AD. Seimu is best known for organizing his local governments by appointing the first provincial governors and district officials. While the details of his system of governing remain elusive, at the time Imperial princes were sent to important places in the provinces. These members are designated as \"wake\", which represented their status as a branch of the Imperial family. It has been theorized by Brinkley and Kikuchi that these appointments of local governors were designed to extend the \"prestige of the Court\". Those that were eligible included \"men of merit\", Imperial princes, or chiefs of aboriginal tribes.\nThe records state that Seimu had a wife named , who was the daughter of \"Take-oshiyama-tari-ne\". Oho-takara bore the Emperor one child, named . Seimu's only son appears to have died at a young age as the Emperor appointed Yamato Takeru's son as Crown Prince, before his own death in 190 AD at the age 107 years old. His nephew \"Tarashinakatsuhiko\" was later enthroned as the next emperor in 192 AD. Seimu's death marked an end of direct lineage from legendary Emperor Jimmu, and was the first split branch of others that later followed.\nKnown information.\nEmperor Seimu is regarded by historians as a \"legendary Emperor\" as there is insufficient material available for further verification and study. His existence is open to debate given this lack of information. If Seimu did exist, there is no evidence to suggest that the title \"tenn\u014d\" was used during the time period to which his reign has been assigned. It is much more likely that he was a chieftain, or local clan leader, and the polity he ruled would have only encompassed a small portion of modern-day Japan. The name Seimu\"-tenn\u014d\" was more than likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Seimu, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the \"Kojiki\". There is a possibility that Seimu ruled during the first half of the 4th century when Japan became a unified state ruled from Yamato, making these accounts \"not improbable\".\nWhile the actual site of Seimu's grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Nara.

Both the \"Kojiki\", and the \"Nihon Shoki\" (collectively known as the \"Kiki\") record events that took place during Ch\u016bai's alleged lifetime. Ch\u016bai is the first monarch to ascend the throne who was not a son of the previous Emperor as the latter's only child died young. He is also noted for having his capital in Kyushu, rather than Yamato like his predecessors. The records state that Ch\u016bai had a wife named \"Okinagatarashihime-no-Mikoto\" (later Jing\u016b), and 2 consorts that all bore him 4 children.\nCh\u016bai's reign is conventionally considered to have been from 192 to 200 AD. The events leading up to the Emperor's death have been subject to interpretation as they involve a vengeful Kami (spirit) indirectly killing Ch\u016bai. This event allegedly occurred after the Emperor disrespectfully scoffed at the Kami's request. His wife Jing\u016b carried out the Kami's request which was to invade Korea, but this has since been considered legendary rather than factual. While the location of Ch\u016bai's grave (if any) is unknown, he is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto tomb, and at a Hachiman shrine.\nModern historians have come to the conclusion that the title of \"Emperor\" and the name \"Ch\u016bai\" were used by later generations to describe this legendary Emperor. It has also been proposed that Ch\u016bai actually reigned much later than he is attested. Emperor Ch\u016bai is traditionally listed as the last Emperor of the Yayoi period.\nLegendary narrative.\nThe Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Ch\u016bai is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\", which are collectively known as or \"Japanese chronicles\". These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. The records state that Ch\u016bai was born to Futaji no Iri Hime sometime in 149 AD, and was given the name . Ch\u016bai's father was allegedly the legendary prince, Yamato Takeru. He was the first Emperor who was not the child of the previous Emperor, being instead the nephew of his predecessor Emperor Seimu. The title of \"Crown Prince\" was given to him by his uncle before his death in 190 AD, two years later Ch\u016bai became the next Emperor. Unlike his predecessors who had maintained their capitals in Yamato Province, the records state his palace was first located on the northern shores of Shimonoseki Strait, then south of that in Kyushu.\nEmperor Ch\u016bai is described in the \"Kiki\" as having been ten feet tall, with \"a countenance of perfect beauty\". He had one wife who was named \" Okinagatarashi\" (aka Jing\u016b), and two consorts who all bore him four children. During the start of his reign, he made progress to modern day Tsuruga, and led an expedition to Kii where he heard news of a revolt. Jing\u016b accompanied him to the west to fight against a tribe in Tsukushi (located in modern-day Fukuoka Prefecture) called \"Kumaso\". On the eve of battle though, his wife was suddenly possessed by some unknown kami who advised Ch\u016bai to invade and conquer Korea. The Kami gave the reasoning that the \"Kumaso\" were not worthy of \"his steel\". Ch\u016bai refused with scorn for a number of reasons which included giving up a military campaign, and doubting that such a land even existed. It is said that the Kami was so enraged by this disrespect, that Emperor Ch\u016bai was later killed in a battle that beat down his troops.\nThe death of the Emperor was kept quiet by Jing\u016b, who vanquished the \"Kumaso\" soon afterwards in a fit of revenge. Jing\u016b then respected the wishes of the Kami by invading Korea, and subjugated the eastern Korean kingdom of Shiragi. The other two Korean kingdoms at the time voluntarily submitted, and Jing\u016b ascended to the throne as Empress. Jing\u016b's occupation of the Korean Peninsula, and reign as Empress are now considered to be legendary rather than factual. The modern traditional view is that Ch\u016bai's son (\"Homutawake\") became the next Emperor after Jing\u016b acted as a regent. She would have been de facto ruler in the interim.\nKnown information.\nEmperor Ch\u016bai is regarded by historians as a \"legendary Emperor\" as there is insufficient material available for further verification and study. The lack of this information has made his very existence open to debate. There is no evidence to suggest that the title \"tenn\u014d\" was used during the time to which Ch\u016bai's reign has been assigned. It is certainly possible that he was a chieftain or local clan leader, and that the polity he ruled would have only encompassed a small portion of modern-day Japan. The name Ch\u016bai\"-tenn\u014d\" was more than likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Ch\u016bai, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the \"Kojiki\".\nThe manner in which Ch\u016bai died has since been broken down to at least two theories. In his book \"Confucianism O - Z\", professor Xinzhong Yao notes that it is possible the late Emperor could have succumbed to illness rather than death on the battlefield. Sources which include Yao, Francis Brinkley, and Kikuchi Dairoku also cite the enemy arrow scenario. While the actual site of Ch\u016bai's grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Nara. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Ch\u016bai's mausoleum, and is formally named \"Ega no Naganu no nishi no misasagi\". The Kami (spirit) of Ch\u016bai is also enshrined at the Tamukeyama Hachiman Shrine in Nara. Ch\u016bai is traditionally listed as the last Emperor of the Yayoi period, who could have in reality ruled in the 4th century.

Both the \"Kojiki\", and the \"Nihon Shoki\" (collectively known as the \"Kiki\") record events that took place during \u014cjin's alleged lifetime. \u014cjin is traditionally listed as the first emperor of the Kofun period, and is primarily known for being the controversial son of Empress Jing\u016b. Historians have mixed views on his factual existence; if \u014cjin was indeed a historical figure, then it is assumed he reigned much later than he is attested.\nNo firm dates can be assigned to \u014cjin's life or reign, but he is traditionally considered to have reigned from 270 to 310. According to the Shinto religion and Buddhism in Japan, Emperor \u014cjin is the divine spirit of the deity Hachiman (\u516b\u5e61\u795e). While the location of \u014cjin's grave (if any) is unknown, he is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto tomb. Modern historians have come to the conclusion that the title of \"Emperor\" and the name \"\u014cjin\" was used by later generations to describe this possibly legendary Emperor.\nLegendary narrative.\nThe Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for \u014cjin is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\", which are collectively known as or \"Japanese chronicles\". These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. The circumstances surrounding the future emperor's birth are controversial as they involve a supposed invasion of the Korean Peninsula as well as a biologically impossible gestation period (3 years). It is said by the Kiki that \u014cjin was conceived but unborn when his father Emperor Ch\u016bai died. Empress Jing\u016b then became a de facto ruler who allegedly invaded a \"promised land\" (Korea) out of revenge, then returned three years later to the Japanese mainland to give birth. The records state that \u014cjin was born to Empress Jing\u016b in Tsukushi Province sometime in 201 AD, and was given the name . He became the crown prince at the age of four, but was not crowned Emperor until 270 AD at the age of 70. Emperor \u014cjin supposedly lived in two palaces which are now located in present-day Osaka. His reign lasted 40 years until his death in 310 AD, in all he fathered 28 children with one spouse and ten consorts. His fourth son \" \u014cosazaki\" was later enthroned as the next emperor in 313 AD.\nKnown information.\nWhile the historical existence of Emperor \u014cjin is debated among historians, there is a general consensus that he was \"probably real\". There is also an agreement that Ojin's three year conception period is mythical and symbolic, rather than realistic. William George Aston has suggested that this can be interpreted as a period of less than nine months containing three \"years\" (some seasons), e.g. three harvests. If \u014cjin was an actual historical figure then historians have proposed that he ruled later than attested. Dates of his actual reign have been proposed to be as early as 370 to 390 AD, to as late as the early 5th century AD. At least one Japanese historian has cast doubt on this theory though, by revising a supporting statement given in 1972. In this new narrative Louis Perez states: \"only kings and emperors after the reign of Ojin... ...are seen as historical figures\". In either case there is also no evidence to suggest that the title \"tenn\u014d\" was used during the time to which \u014cjin's reign has been assigned. It is certainly possible that he was a chieftain or local clan leader, and that the polity he ruled would have only encompassed a small portion of modern-day Japan.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as \u014cjin's mausoleum, and is formally named \"Eega no Mofushi no oka no misasagi\".

Nintoku's contemporary title would not have been \"tenn\u014d\", as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jit\u014d.

This emperor is best known for an assassination attempt on his life by his brother \"Suminoe\" after the death of their father Emperor Nintoku. Although no firm dates can be assigned to his life, Rich\u016b's brief reign is conventionally considered to have been from 400 to 405.\nDuring his reign local recorders were allegedly appointed for the first time in various provinces, a royal treasury was established, and court waitresses (Uneme) first appeared. Rich\u016b had both a wife and a concubine during his lifetime which bore him 4 children (2 boys and 2 girls). None of his children would inherit the throne as Rich\u016b appointed the title of crown prince to his other brother \"Mizuhawake\". Rich\u016b allegedly died sometime in 405 at the age of 70, and his brother \"Mizuhawake\" was crowned as Emperor Hanzei in the following year. While the location of Rich\u016b's grave is unknown, he is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto tomb. Modern historians have come to the conclusion that the title of \"Emperor\" and the name \"Rich\u016b\" were used by later generations to describe him. There is also a general consensus that Rich\u016b was not a legendary figure.\nProtohistoric narrative.\nThe Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Rich\u016b is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\", which are collectively known as or \"Japanese chronicles\". These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. These records state that Rich\u016b was born to sometime in 336 AD, and was given the name . He was the eldest son of Emperor Nintoku, and was later appointed crown prince by his father during the 31st year of his father's reign. (343 AD). When Nintoku died in 399 AD, a period of mourning was followed by a scandal that almost took the Crown Prince's life.\nAssassination attempt.\nSometime during the interval before Rich\u016b assumed the throne, he sent his younger brother, to make marriage arrangements for his consort . Prince Nakatsu instead passed himself off as his older brother Rich\u016b, and seduced Kuro-hime. When the act was done he carelessly left his wrist-bells behind at Kuro-hime's house. Rich\u016b later discovered these during his first visit to her house, assumed what his brother had done, but decided to take no action against him. Nakatsu on the other hand was fearful of his scandalous actions and plotted to kill his brother that night. He secretly raised a small group of people who surrounded his brother's palace. Luckily for Rich\u016b, some of his loyal retainers intervened by rescuing the heir and carrying him off to Isonokami Shrine in Yamoto. Nakatsu meanwhile set fire to the besieged palace not knowing of his brother's escape.\nRich\u016b's other younger brother (later Emperor Hanzei) followed him to Yamoto. He was told by Rich\u016b though, that unless he proved his loyalty by killing Nakatsu he could not be trusted. Mizuhawake returned to Naniwa and bribed one of Nakatsu's retainers to kill him. Nakatsu was utterly defenseless and unprepared as he assumed his brother had fled and disappeared. He was subsequently stabbed to death by his retainer, and Mizuhawake made his way back to Yamoto to report his death. Rich\u016b in turn gratefully granted his younger brother \"Mura-ahase granaries.\nReign.\nRich\u016b was crowned emperor after his brother's failed rebellion had been put to rest in the following year (400 AD). During this time, those who were not executed for their participation in the rebellion were forced to undergo tattooing as a punishment. Kurohime was also officially appointed as a concubine later in that year. Although the two had two sons and a daughter, Rich\u016b appointed the title of \"Crown Prince\" to his brother Prince Mizuhawake (later Emperor Hanzei) in 401 AD. In the year 403 AD, \"local recorders were appointed for the first time in various provinces, who noted down statements and communicated writings of the four quarters.\" Kurohime died sometime in the following year (404 AD) under unclear circumstances. Its said that the Emperor heard a voice in the wind utter mysterious words in the \"great void\" before a messenger announced of her death. Rich\u016b attributed the cause to an offended deity due to the misconduct of an official regarding a shrine. Princess Kusakanohatabino-hime was appointed empress in the following year (405 AD), and the two gave birth to a daughter (Princess Nakashi). A royal treasury was also established in that year which was managed by two appointed Koreans. Emperor Rich\u016b's reign ended during its sixth year, when he fell ill and succumbed to disease at the age of 64 or 70. The \"kiki\" states that Rich\u016b was buried in the misasagi on the \"Plain of Mozo no Mimi\". His brother \"Mizuhawake\" was enthroned as the next emperor in the following year (406 AD).\nHistorical assessment.\nRich\u016b is regarded by historians as a ruler during the early 5th century whose existence is generally accepted as fact. Orientalist scholar James Murdoch includes Emperor Rich\u016b in the \"earliest non-legendary\" sovereigns of Japan, while academic Richard Ponsonby-Fane stated that this \"may be termed the semi-historical period\". Scholar Francis Brinkley lists Emperor Rich\u016b under \"Protohistoric sovereigns\", and notes that rulers from this point forward no longer have reigns of \"incredible length\". Others such as author \"Joshua Frydman\" cite Emperor Rich\u016b's lifespan as being realistic in length. Rich\u016b has also been possibly identified with King San in the \"Book of Song\" by Confucian scholars and Arai Hakuseki. According to Chinese records, King San sent messengers to the Liu Song dynasty at least twice in 421 and 425.\nScholars William George Aston and Brinkley disagree on the introduction of local recorders. Aston states in his reasoning that the arrival of the Korean scholar Wani did not take place until 405 AD, and \"[historians] have not yet got down to time of accurate chronologically\". Brinkley counters this by saying that Wani's innovation was \"not the art of writing, but, in all probability, a knowledge of the Chinese classics\". Academic Delmer Brown wrote that during Rich\u016b's reign, court waitresses (Uneme) appeared. There were also storehouses (Kura) built in various provinces, and an \"Administrator of State Affairs\" from his reign on. It is commonly accepted among historians that Emperor Rich\u016b was in his late 60s if not 70 when he died.\nThere is no evidence to suggest that the title \"tenn\u014d\" was used during the time to which Rich\u016b's reign has been assigned. It is certainly possible that he was a chieftain or local clan leader, and that the polity he ruled would have only encompassed a small portion of modern-day Japan. It's also possible he could have had the title of , meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven\", or \"Great King of Yamato\". The name Rich\u016b\"-tenn\u014d\" was more than likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Rich\u016b, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the \"Kojiki\".\nWhile the actual site of Rich\u016b's grave is not known, this regent is traditionally venerated at a \"kofun\"-type Imperial tomb in Sakai, Osaka. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Rich\u016b's mausoleum, and is formally named . It is also identified as the kofun. Outside of the \"Kiki\", the reign of Emperor Kinmei (\u00a0\u2013 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates.

Both the \"Kojiki\", and the \"Nihon Shoki\" (collectively known as the \"Kiki\") recorded events that took place during Hanzei's alleged lifetime. No firm dates can be assigned to this Emperor's life or reign, but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 406 CE to 410 CE. His family included an \"Imperial Lady\", and \"Concubine\" which bore him 4 children. Historians have stated that while nothing remarkable took place during Hanzei's brief reign, he did have ranked concubines which is an introduced Chinese custom.\nHanzei died sometime in 410 AD without naming an heir to the throne which caused Imperial ministers to name a successor. While the location of Hanzei's grave is unknown, he is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto tomb. Modern historians have come to the conclusion that the title of \"Emperor\" and the name \"Hanzei\" were used by later generations to describe him. There is also a general consensus regarding Hanzei's factual existence.\nProtohistoric narrative.\nThe Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Hanzei is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\", which are collectively known as or \"Japanese chronicles\". These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. It's recorded in the \"Kiki\" that Hanzei was born to sometime in 352 AD, and was given the name . He was the third son of Emperor Nintoku, and a younger brother of Emperor Rich\u016b. The phrase \"Mizu ha\" in the name \"Mizuhawake\" translates to \"beautiful teeth\", as he was said to have beautiful \"exceptionally large\" \"teeth like one bone\" all of the same size. Only the \"Kojiki\" mentions the alleged full grown height of Emperor Hanzei which is said to have been . Shortly after Nintoku died, his elder brother attempted to assassinate his eldest brother (Rich\u016b). \"Mizuhawake\" was able to bribe one of Nakatsu's retainers into killing Nakatsu in order to prove his loyalty to the future emperor.\nAccording to the \"Nihon Shoki\", Rich\u016b bypassed his own children to make his younger brother Mizuhawake crown prince in 401 AD. The given reason is that a \"Tajihi\" flower fell into a well which gave the name of \"Mizuhawake\" as the next heir to be. Mizuhawake was proclaimed as \"Emperor Hanzei\" upon Rich\u016b's death in 405 AD, and was enthroned sometime in the following year. Shortly after his enthronement Hanzei took as an \"Imperial concubine\", and eventually her younger sister as a consort. The two Empresses bore him 4 children which consisted of 2 sons and 2 daughters. During Emperor Hanzei's reign, he ruled from the palace Shibagaki no Miya at \"Tajihi\" in the province of Kawachi (present-day Matsubara, Osaka). During his five-year reign the country enjoyed a time of peace. Emperor Hanzei died peacefully in his palace sometime in 410 AD without naming an heir (crown prince). This issue was later settled by Imperial ministers who selected Emperor Nintoku's youngest son Ingy\u014d as the next emperor.\nHistorical assessment.\nHanzei is regarded by historians as a ruler during the early 5th century whose existence is generally accepted as fact. Scholar Francis Brinkley lists Emperor Hanzei under \"Protohistoric sovereigns\", but notes that his short reign was \"not remarkable for anything\" except for indirect evidence that Chinese customs were beginning to be adopted by the Japanese court. Scholar William George Aston notes in his translation of the Nihon Shoki that \"three ranks of concubines are mentioned\", which at the time were of Chinese origin (ranked concubines). Others such as author Ryoichi Maenosono (Kokushi Daijiten) identify Emperor Hanzei with \"King Chin of the Five kings of Wa. According to Chinese records, King Chin sent a tribute to the Liu Song dynasty in 438 AD.\nBritish academic and Japanologist Basil Hall Chamberlain notes in his translation of the Kojiki that no accurate information exists regarding the ancient Japanese measures used to get Hanzei's alleged height of . He went on to say that \"the English equivalents used in this passage correspond but approximately to the modern Japanese standards\". As for Hanzei's ascension, the \"Nihon Shoki\" mentions that \"Tajihi\" is now known as the itadori flower. Aston notes though, that the story of a \"Tajihi\" flower falling into a well is inconsistent with a later passage in the Nihon Shoki which refers to \"Tajihi\" as a location (not a flower).\nThere is no evidence to suggest that the title \"tenn\u014d\" was used during the time to which Hanzei's reign has been assigned. Rather, it was presumably , meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven\". An alternate title could have also been \"Great King of Yamato\".

No firm dates can be assigned to this Emperor's life or reign, but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 410 to 453.\nWhile the location of Ingy\u014d's grave (if any) is unknown, he is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto tomb.\nProtohistoric narrative.\nThe Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Ingy\u014d is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\", which are collectively known as or \"Japanese chronicles\". These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. It's recorded in the \"Kiki\" that Ingy\u014d was born to somewhere between 373 and 375 AD and was given the name . He was the fourth son of Emperor Nintoku, making him the youngest brother of Rich\u016b and Hanzei. After the death of his brother Hanzei in 410 AD Oasazuma was approached by ministers who had unanimously chosen him as the next Emperor. Oasazuma declined the offer stating that his brothers had \"despised him as a fool\". He also called himself \"unlucky\" as he claimed to be suffering from an unmentioned paralyzing illness.\nAfter more than two years had passed, Oasazuma was finally persuaded by his favorite concubine Oshisaka no \u014cnakatsuhime to accept the throne. Oasazuma was formally enthroned as Emperor Ingy\u014d and his concubine became the next K\u014dg\u014d. Sometime in early 414 an envoy was sent to Silla and procured a physician for the ailing Emperor. The physician attributed the problem to Ingy\u014d's legs and was able to cure him in August of that year. In 415 AD, Ingy\u014d reformed the system of family and clan names. This had been an ongoing issue as many families either gave false names or used a clan title with a ranking they hadn't earned. In the middle of 416 AD, an earthquake hit Japan which disrupted the \"temporary\" burial process of Emperor Hanzei.\nSometime in the winter of 418 AD, empress Oshisaka no \u014cnakatsuhime unintentionally introduced her husband to her younger sister at a banquet. Emperor Ingy\u014d fell deeply in love and sent a messenger afterwards to summon her. He learned that the woman's name was \"Otohime\" (\"youngest princess\"), but was given the designation of \"Sotohori Iratsume\" (\"clothing pass maiden\") by local men for her beauty. Otohime initially refused to comply as she didn't want to hurt her sister's feelings. Not wanting to face punishment for disobeying, the messenger stayed with Otohime until she agreed to come. Oshisaka was not pleased by this and refused to let Otohime into the Imperial palace. Ingy\u014d thus built Otohime a separate residence nearby where he often sneaked off to.\nEmpress Oshisaka no \u014cnakatsuhime bore Ingy\u014d a total of nine children (5 sons and 4 daughters). In 434 AD Ingy\u014d chose to name his first son Kinashi no Karu as Crown Prince. This was unknowingly a controversial choice as Kinashi was later accused of an incestuous relationship with his sister, Princess Karu no \u014ciratsume. Ingy\u014d couldn't punish his son due to the title he had bestowed upon him, so instead chose an indirect approach by banishing his daughter Karu no \u014ciratsume to Iyo. When Emperor Ingy\u014d died sometime in 453 AD, the king of Silla grieved so much that he presented Japan with 80 musicians to comfort Ingyo's soul. Kinashi no Karu meanwhile faced a challenge as his younger brother Anaho was favored to be heir apparent.\nHistorical assessment.\nIngy\u014d is regarded by historians as a ruler during the early 5th century whose existence is generally accepted as fact. Scholar Francis Brinkley lists Emperor Ingy\u014d under \"Protohistoric sovereigns\" whose reign was occupied by an affair and scandal by his son. Other scholars identify Ingy\u014d with King Sai in the \"Book of Song\". This would have been a king of Japan (referred to as \"Wa\" by contemporary Chinese scholars) who is said to have sent messengers to the Liu Song dynasty at least twice, in 443 and 451. However, there is no record in the \"Kiki\" of messengers being sent.\nTitles and dating.\nThere is no evidence to suggest that the title \"tenn\u014d\" was used during the time to which Ingy\u014d's reign has been assigned. Rather, it was presumably , meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven\". An alternate title could have also been \"Great King of Yamato\". The name Ingy\u014d\"-tenn\u014d\" was more than likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Ingy\u014d, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the \"Kojiki\".\nOutside of the \"Kiki\", the reign of Emperor Kinmei (\u00a0\u2013 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as \"traditional\" though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.\nEvents during reign.\nEarly on in his reign, Emperor Ingy\u014d chose to send envoys to Korea for medical assistance. Brinkley took note of this and stated that Korea was evidently regarded as the \"home of healing science\". He also attributed the \"many other\" arts which were borrowed from China. In regard to reforms, Sholar William George Aston notes in his translation of the Nihon Shoki that when Ingy\u014d reformed the system of family and clan names, it would have only applied to dominant caste. At the time the general populace of Japan kept their personal names and \"cared little for geopolitics\". Emperor Ingy\u014d's later affair with \"Otohime\" is regarded as important by Brinkley as it illustrates the manners and customs at the time. He also suggests that the \"atmosphere of loose morality\" was in part responsible for Kinashi no Karu's incestuous relationship.\nIt is agreed upon by Basil Hall Chamberlain's translation of the Kojiki, and Aston's translation of the Nihon Shoki that Prince Kinashi no Karu was probably appointed crown prince during his father's lifetime. At the time, marriage between children of the same father had always been allowed as long as the mothers involved were different. Marriage of children of the same mother of whom Kinashi no Karu was guilty of was considered incest. Aston notes in his translation of the Nihon Shoki that it's doubtful Karu no \u014ciratsume was banished by her father. Historically women have always been more lightly punished than men for the same offense, and \"the particular character of the fault in this case makes such a discrimination all the more reasonable\".\nFrancis Brinkley comments that four facts present themselves during Emperor Ingy\u014d's reign: \"Men wore wristbands and garters to which grelots were attached, that a high value was set for pearls, that metal was used for the construction of great man's gates, and the first earthquake is said to have been experienced in 416 AD\". The latter of these things allegedly leveled the Imperial Palace at Kyoto from the severity of the Earth's tremors. Modern sources have since questioned the reliability of this \"first earthquake\", opting instead to recognize another that took place in Nara prefecture on May 28, 599 during the reign of Empress Suiko.\nGravesite.\nWhile the actual site of Ingy\u014d's grave is not known, this regent is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine in Fujiidera Osaka. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Ingy\u014d's mausoleum/\"kofun\"-type Imperial tomb. Formally, this tomb is called , but is also given the name . Another burial candidate for Emperor Ingy\u014d's is the , which is also located in Fujiidera. Ingy\u014d is also enshrined at the Imperial Palace along with other emperors and members of the Imperial Family at the Three Palace Sanctuaries.\nFurther reading.\n "}

It's recorded in the \"Kiki\" that Ingy\u014d was born to somewhere in 400 AD, and was given the name . While he was the third son of Emperor Ingy\u014d, the title of \"Crown Prince\" was not bestowed upon him in his father's lifetime. For this particular sovereign, the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki tell different versions of what allegedly happened in regard to Emperor Ank\u014d's older brother \"Prince Kinashi no Karu\".\nWar between Anaho and Kinashi.\nAfter Emperor Ingy\u014d's death in 453 AD, Crown Prince \"Kinashi no Karu\" faced a mounting problem. The incestuous relationship with his sister, Princess Karu no \u014ciratsume had caused the public to shun him and his retainers refused to follow. Karu chose to take up arms against his younger brother as his retainers had instead given their allegiance to him. Prince responded with a force of his own which prompted Karu to flee and take refuge at a noble family's residence. From this point on, the \"Kiki\" splits narratives that converge again with the same fatal outcome. In the \"Nihon Shoki's\" version of events, \"Kinashi no Karu\" takes his final stand at the residence where he commits an honorary suicide. The Nihon Shoki does not say what happened to Princess Karu no \u014ciratsume other than her being banished to Iyo by Emperor Ingy\u014d during his lifetime for incest. In the \"Kojikis\" version of events, \"Kinashi no Karu\" surrenders to his younger brother and is banished to Iyo. Karu no \u014ciratsume follows him to Iyo afterwards and the two commit suicide together.\nReign.\nPrince was enthroned as \"Emperor Ank\u014d\" towards the end of 453 AD. During this time the capital was moved to \"Isonokami\" (located in Yamoto) where the new emperor had his palace. One of Ank\u014d's first decisions in the following year was to arrange a marriage between his younger brother, , and Hatahihime, who was a sister of his uncle . Ank\u014d dispatched his servant to negotiate with Ookusaka, and he happily consented to the marriage. As a token of approval, he entrusted Ne-no-omi with a richly jeweled coronet to be presented to the Emperor. Unbeknownst to Ank\u014d, his servant chose to keep the coronet for himself and lied to him by saying Ookusaka refused to comply. Ank\u014d believed Ne-no-omi's words and infuriated with rage sent his soldiers to kill Ookusaka and take his wife Nakashi (Emperor Rich\u016b\u2019s daughter) as his Kogo. Hatahihime was then married to \u014chatuse in accordance with the Emperor's wishes. Aside from his eventual demise, there aren't any other noteworthy events during Ank\u014d's reign.\nDeath.\nAnk\u014d married Nakashi whom he \"loved deeply\" in 455 AD, but before this time she already had a son named (Prince Mayowa). The young prince (6 years old at the time) was able to escape punishment on \"his mother's account\" and was brought up in the royal palace. Sometime in the Autumn of 456 AD, Emperor Ank\u014d confided to Nakashi that he was worried one day Mayowa may seek to avenge his father's death. Mayowa overheard this remark and crept to the side of his step-father who was asleep in Nakashi's lap. He then proceeded to cut off Ank\u014d's head with his own sword. At the time of his death Ank\u014d was 56 years old, had no children of his own, and according to the Nihon Shoki was buried sometime in 459 AD. Prince \u014chatuse no Wakatakeru (Emperor Ingy\u014d's youngest son) became the next Emperor towards the end of 456 AD after killing Prince Mayowa and the rest of his competition.\nHistorical assessment.\nAnk\u014d is regarded by historians as a ruler during the mid 5th century whose existence is generally accepted as fact. Scholar Francis Brinkley lists Emperor Ank\u014d under \"Protohistoric sovereigns\" whose reign was \"a discreditable page of Japanese History\". Other scholars identify Ank\u014d with King K\u014d in the \"Book of Song\". This would have been a king of Japan (referred to as \"Wa\" by contemporary Chinese scholars) who is said to have sent tribute to the Southern Dynasty of China in 462, during the reign of Emperor Taiwu of the Northern Wei. It also mentions that King K\u014d was appointed as the \"General of the East\". However, there is no record in the \"Kiki\" of any tribute being sent during this time.\nTitles and dating.\nThere is no evidence to suggest that the title \"tenn\u014d\" was used during the time to which Ank\u014d's reign has been assigned. Rather, it was presumably , meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven\". An alternate title could have also been \"Great King of Yamato\". The name Ank\u014d\"-tenn\u014d\" was more than likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Ank\u014d, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the \"Kojiki\".\nOutside of the \"Kiki\", the reign of Emperor Kinmei (\u00a0\u2013 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as \"traditional\" though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.\nEvents during reign.\nEmperor Ank\u014d had a short 3-year reign which is largely confined to an event that had deadly consequences. Scholar William George Aston notes in his translation of the Nihon Shoki that Hatahihime and are implied in the Shukai as grandchildren rather than children of Emperor Nintoku. He states that the \"obvious explanation\" is that the \"chronicle is entirely untrustworthy\". At the point where Emperor Ank\u014d's servant relays false information regarding Prince Ookusaka's alleged rejection, the emperor had no reason to doubt him. Frank Brinkley notes that it was \"not customary in those days\" to conduct investigations (in this case a servant).\nThe exact account of Emperor Ank\u014d's death is also questionable given that a child could conceive or commit such a thing. Scholar Francis Brinkley suggests that Empress Nakashi played a role in her husband's death. He also suggests that answer might lie with who later became Emperor Y\u016bryaku. Brinkley argues that if \u014chatuse had no issue with killing several of his family members to obtain the throne, then there is no reason why he wouldn't have started with the reigning emperor.\nGravesite.\nWhile the actual site of Ank\u014d's grave is not known, this regent is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine at the ruins of Horai Castle in Nara City. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Ank\u014d's mausoleum/\"kofun\"-type Imperial tomb. Formally, this tomb is called , but is also given the name . Another possible burial theory involves the , whose owner remains unknown. Ank\u014d is also enshrined at the Imperial Palace along with other emperors and members of the Imperial Family at the Three Palace Sanctuaries.\nFurther reading.\n "}

According to the \"Kojiki\", this Emperor is said to have ruled from the Thirteenth Day of the Eleventh Month of 456 (Heishin) until his death on the Seventh Day of the Eight Month of 479 (Kibi). He is the first archaeologically verifiable Japanese emperor.\nProtohistoric narrative.\nThe Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Y\u016bryaku is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\", which are collectively known as or \"Japanese chronicles\". These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. It is recorded in the \"Kiki\" that Y\u016bryaku was born to sometime in 417 or 418 AD, and was given the name . As the fifth and youngest son of Emperor Ingy\u014d he was never given the title of \"Crown Prince\" due to his two older living brothers.\nAscension.\n\u014chatsuse was thrown into a fit of rage when he learned that his brother Emperor Ank\u014d was assassinated in 456 AD. He then immediately became suspicious of his two elder brothers as conspirers. \u014chatsuse's first action was to question Prince Shirahiko regarding what could have happened. Shirahiko allegedly knew \u014chatsuse was up to no good, so he sat silently which prompted \u014chatsuse to kill him both individually with a sword. He then turned his rage towards the boy assassin (Prince Mayowa), and his other brother Kurohiko by burning him to death. This just left Emperor Rich\u016b's eldest son Prince Ichinobe no Oshiwa in contention for the throne. \n\u014chatsuse was resentful that Ank\u014d had formally wished to transfer the kingdom to Ichinobe. Both the Nihon Shoki and Kojiki describe how \u014chatsuse took Prince Ichinobe and his younger brother Prince Mima out hunting and \"treacherously\" killed them. The sons of Prince Ichinobe fled to Harima and went into hiding, later becoming Emperor Kenz\u014d and Emperor Ninken. \u014chatsuse (later known as Emperor Y\u016bryaku) was then enthroned sometime afterwards in November 456. The new emperor subsequently made \"Asakura no Miya\" at Sakurai, Nara the location of his imperial palace. Emperor Rich\u016b's widow Kusaka no Hatabi no hime was appointed Empress with three concubines in March 457.\nReign.\nAccording to the \"Kiki\", Emperor Y\u016bryaku's reign was full of tyranny and cruelty. He allegedly ordered a girl to \"have her four limbs stretched on a tree and be roasted to death\" due to misplaced affection. Another account states that he killed one of his servants during a hunt because his servant did not understand how to cut up animal meat. Y\u016bryaku also allegedly removed a high official to a distant post so he could help himself to the man's wife. The Emperor arbitrary and capriciously killed so many men and women that he was referred to as Emperor of Great Wickedness by the public. However, it is noted that Y\u016bryaku improved his behavior after being admonished by the empress. On a more positive side, Y\u016bryaku greatly encouraged arts and crafts during his reign. Silkworms were cultivated by the Empress, and expert handicraftsmen were commissioned from Baekje (Korea). While the Empress herself never bore Y\u016bryaku any children, he had three sons and two daughters with his concubines.\nIn the 22nd year of his reign (477 AD) Y\u016bryaku moved the temple of Toyoukeohokami (present: Gaiku temple) from Tamba to Yamada in Ise.\nIn 463, Y\u016bryaku Tenn\u014d invited the thunder god of the Mimuro hill to come to the Imperial Palace, and ordered Chiisakobe no muraji Sugaru to fetch the deity. He obliged, thinking the supernatural being would have no reason to refuse the invitation, and rode carrying a halberd with a red banner, symbolising his office of royal messenger. Soon enough, the thunder struck, and Sugaru enlisted the help of priests to enshrine the kami into a portable carriage, to be brought in the Emperor's presence, as a great serpent. But, said Emperor neglected to practice proper ritual purification and religious abstinence. The thunder kami then showed his displeasure through thundering and threatening fiery eyeballs, and Emperor Y\u016bryaku fled into the interior of the Palace while covering his eyes. The great serpent was returned to Mimuro, and the Emperor made many offerings to appease the angry deity. This story is recorded in Nihongi and mentioned by William George Aston, in \"Shinto, the Ancient Religion of Japan\" as well as several other books.\nHistorical assessment.\nY\u016bryaku is regarded by historians as a ruler during the 5th century whose existence is generally accepted as fact. Scholar Francis Brinkley lists Emperor Y\u016bryaku under \"Protohistoric sovereigns\" where he remarks that while some historians have described him as an \"austere\" man, \"few readers of his annals will be disposed to endure such a lenient verdict.\" Scottish Orientalist scholar and journalist James Murdoch regards Y\u016bryaku as a \"much maligned person who was a strong if somewhat ferocious ruler.\" British academic and author Richard Ponsonby-Fane noted that the Emperor is described as a \"mighty hunter\" as its recorded that the God \"Hitokotonushi\" accompanied him in the chase.\nA cognitive analysis \"as deciphered in the Nihon shoki\" was conducted in 2024 by the National Institute of Japanese Literature. In this analysis Emperor Y\u016bryaku was included as an example of \"impulsive murder and the tendency to become enraged.\" Factors such as \"the disproportion between the triggering events\", \"the violence expressed by the emperor on such occasions (quite extreme in degree)\", and the \"frequent occurrence of such descriptions\" were then considered for a conclusion. It is suggested that Emperor Y\u016bryaku may have had an \"intermittent explosive disorder, a type of Impulse-control disorder.\"\nThe Emperor's interest in poetry is amongst the more well-documented aspects of his character and reign. Poems attributed to him are included in the \"Man'y\u014dsh\u016b\", and a number of his verses are preserved in the \"Kojiki\" and the \"Nihonshoki\". Archaeological research has also confirmed that large keyhole-shaped tombs belonging to the chiefs of local ruling families disappeared from around the end of the 5th century when Y\u016bryaku reigned.\nOutside of the \"Kiki\", the reign of Emperor Kinmei (\u00a0\u2013 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as \"traditional\" though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.\nGreat King of Yamoto.\nDuring this moment in history, the calendar system of the Nihon Shoki changes from before and after Y\u016bryaku's reign. As his name is mentioned at the beginning of the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b and Nihon Ry\u014diki, this is seen as a historical turning point. Previously the Japanese archipelago had been a confederation of powerful ruling families from various regions. This appeared to have changed with the appearance of Emperor Yuryaku as the autocratic rule of the Great King was established and a centralized system centered on the Great King began. This is further supported by a major discovery that occurred in 1968 when the iron Inariyama burial-mound sword was extracted from a tomb. In 1978, X-ray analysis revealed a gold-inlaid inscription that comprises at least 115 Chinese characters. The given year on the sword is denoted as \"xin-hai\" (\"Year of the Metal Pig\") according to the Chinese sexagenary cycle, in which the name of the year is recycled every 60 years. While this year is generally regarded in Japan to correspond to 471 AD, at least one historian suggests that 531 is a more likely date. \nThe person buried in the tomb is given the name \"Wowake\", who was thought to be an influential warrior in the region. King Waka Takiru in the transcription is thought to be the same person as \u014chatsuse-wakatakeru-no-mikoto as mentioned in the \"Nihon Shoki\", an alias of Emperor Y\u016bryaku. As each inscription contains the name of an official position, this suggests that a system similar to the Bemin was already in place. While the Eta Funayama Sword also apparently mentions the name \"Waka Takiru\", many characters on that sword are illegible possibly due to polishing by a Japanese sword sharpener at the end of the Taisho period. If Y\u016bryaku's name can be corroborated to this sword then it can be interpreted that the power of the Great King had already extended from Kyushu to Togoku by the latter half of the 5th century.\nThere is no evidence to suggest that the title \"tenn\u014d\" (meaning \"emperor\") was used during the time to which Y\u016bryaku's reign has been assigned. Instead, his title could have possibly been , meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven\", or \"Great King of Yamato\". The name Y\u016bryaku\"-tenn\u014d\" was more than likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Y\u016bryaku, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the \"Kojiki\".\nKing Bu.\nThere is also a theory that Emperor Y\u016bryaku is synonymous with King Bu (\u6b66) as written in the Chinese records. According to the Book of Song, Bu dispatched envoys to Emperor Shun of Song (a Southern Chinese dynasty) in both 477 and 478 AD. The first envoy was to inform the Chinese emperor that King K\u014d (Emperor Ank\u014d) had died, and his older brother had become king. It is written that he called himself \"King of Wa\", and the military commander of several different Kingdoms. Its written that in the following year Emperor Shun appointed Bu the title of \"Grand\" \"Peacekeeper-General of the East\". The full context of this latter passage describes how Bu's ancestors conquered countries, and expanded their power to the east and west. It describes how they crossed the sea to the north and reached the southern part of the Korean Peninsula. Although the kings of Wa (Japan) repeatedly requested that the Emperors of the Song dynasty recognize their military control over Baekje, their efforts were denied. The reason for this is thought to be that the Song dynasty placed importance on Baekje, which was located in a strategically important area. By not offering recognition the Song Emperors could put the Northern Wei in check, and avoid opposition from Goguryeo which was in conflict with Wa. Scholar Francis Brinkley notes that the power of the Koma clan (supported by the Liu Song dynasty) in Goguryeo increased steadily during this time. Brinkley suggests that Emperor Y\u016bryaku's attempts to establish close relations with the Chinese Emperor seem to be from a desire to isolate Korea, which ended in failure.\nThe other two recorded instances regarding King Bu are mentioned in the books of Qi, and Liang. As compared to the former mention in 478 AD, these are not considered to be reliable. Japanese historian Mori Kimiaki points out that both of these appointments coincide with the founding year of their respective dynasties. This is thought to be an administrative matter, and it is not clear whether King Bu (Y\u016bryaku) himself requested it or not. There is at least 1 theory that supports the envoy being sent to Southern Qi in 479 as being factual. This is solely based though, on the description in the title of included in . The fourth and final appointment allegedly made by King Bu (Y\u016bryaku) falls outside of his recorded timeline. As the \"Kiki\" states that Emperor Y\u016bryaku died in 479, the last given year of 502 AD would be implausible.\nGravesite.\nWhile the actual site of Y\u016bryaku's grave is not known, this regent is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") in Habikino, Osaka. As designated by the Imperial Household Agency as Y\u016bryaku's mausoleum, its formal name is \"Tajihi no Takawashi-no-hara no misasagi\". Aside from this shrine in Osaka, there is another burial site named where Y\u016bryaku is a possible burial candidate. Those in doubt of this theory though, point to the construction style of the Kofun which may have begun several decades after Emperor Y\u016bryaku's death. This has led some researchers to add Emperor Ankan as a burial candidate for the Kofun. Y\u016bryaku is also enshrined at the Imperial Palace along with other emperors and members of the Imperial Family at the Three Palace Sanctuaries. He is additionally deified at the in Gose, Nara.\nExternal links.\n "}

There is insufficient material available for further verification and study. Significant differences exist in the records of the \"Kojiki\" and the \"Nihon Shoki\".\nThe \"Kojiki\" puts this emperor's birth year at 485; and his date of death is said to have been April 9, 527. In the extant account, he is called .\nThe \"Nihon Shoki\" gives his birth year at 450; and he is said to have died on February 7, 531 or 534.

Rather, it was presumably , meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven\". Alternatively, Keitai might have been referred to as or the \"Great King of Yamato\".\nGenealogy.\nKeitai was not the son of the immediate previous monarch. According to the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\", Buretsu died without a successor, at which time a fifth generation grandson of Emperor \u014cjin, Keitai, came and ascended the throne.\nIf Emperor Keitai began a new dynasty as some historians believe, then Emperor Buretsu would have been the last monarch of the first recorded dynasty of Japan.\nAccording to the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\", his father was and his mother was . When Buretsu died, Kanamura recommended Keitai (at the age of 58) as a possible heir to the Chrysanthemum throne. His mother, Furihime, was a seventh generation descendant of Emperor Suinin by his son, Prince Iwatsukuwake. His father was a fourth generation descendant of Emperor \u014cjin by his son, Prince Wakanuke no Futamata.\nGenealogy information is supplemented in \"Shaku Nihongi\" which quotes from the now lost text \"J\u014dg\u016bki\" (7th century). It says he was a son of Ushi no \u014ckimi (believed to be equivalent to Hikoushi no \u014ckimi), a grandson of Ohi no \u014ckimi, a great-grandson of Ohohoto no \u014ckimi (brother to Emperor Ingy\u014d's consort), a great-great-grandson of Prince Wakanuke no Futamata, and a great-great-great-grandson of Emperor \u014cjin.\nThe genealogical trees of the \"Nihon Shoki\" have been lost, and the accuracy of its account of events remains unknown. This uncertainty raises arguable doubts about this emperor's genealogy.\nAlthough genealogical information in the \"Shaku Nihongi\" leaves room for discussion, many scholars acknowledge the blood relationship with the Okinaga clan, a powerful local ruling family or the collateral line of the Imperial family-governed \u014cmi region (a part of present-day Shiga Prefecture). This family produced many empresses and consorts throughout history. According to the \"Nihon Shoki\", Ohohoto no \u014ckimi, the great-grandfather of Emperor Keitai, married into the Okinaga clan. Keitai's mother, Furihime, was from a local ruling family in Koshi (Echizen Province), so his mother brought him to her home after his father's death. Abundant traditions relating to the family have been passed down by shrines and old-established families in both regions.\nRegardless of speculation about Keitai's genealogy, it is well settled that there was an extended period of disputes over the succession which developed after Keitai's death. A confrontation arose between adherents of two branches of the Yamato, pitting the supporters of sons who would become known as Emperor Ankan and Emperor Senka against those who were backers of the son who would become known as Emperor Kinmei.\nKeitai's reign.\nKeitai declared his ascension in Kuzuha, in the northern part of Kawachi Province (present day Hirakata, Osaka), and married a younger sister of Emperor Buretsu, Princess Tashiraka. It is supposed that his succession was not welcomed by everyone, and it took about 20 years for Keitai to enter Yamato Province, near Kawachi and the political center of Japan at the time.\nIn Keitai's later years, 527 or 528, the Iwai Rebellion broke out in Tsukushi province, Ky\u016bsh\u016b. Keitai assigned Mononobe no Arakabi as Sh\u014dgun and sent him to Ky\u016bsh\u016b to put down the rebellion.\nAmong his sons, Emperor Ankan, Emperor Senka and Emperor Kinmei ascended to the throne.\nThe actual site of Keitai's grave is not known.

The bid has been contentious, as historic designation would prevent owners from being able to expand or update houses.\nIn February 2017, the Portland Historic Landmarks Commission endorsed the association's nomination for historic status. One week later, the nine-person State Advisory Committee on Historic Preservation unanimously endorsed the proposal, putting the district on \"clear path toward the register\". Historic status may be blocked if dissenting residents submit enough notarized objections by July 1. As of February 17, 675 of the more than 1,000 required objections have been received.\nIn April 2018, four separate home owners split their property ownership among hundreds of trusts; these owners filed more than 5,000 formal objections to the historic district proposal, possibly blocking the nomination using a technical tactic. 952 additional objections were submitted by owners not associated with the hundreds of trusts. According to \"The Oregonian\", \"Without the trusts, the number of objections appears to have fallen short of a majority\".

{"id": "10473", "revid": "48227547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10473", "title": "Emil Theodor Kocher", "text": "Emil Theodor Kocher (25 August 1841 \u2013 27 July 1917) was a Swiss physician and medical researcher who received the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work in the physiology, pathology and surgery of the thyroid. Among his many accomplishments are the introduction and promotion of aseptic surgery and scientific methods in surgery, specifically reducing the mortality of thyroidectomies below 1% in his operations.\nKocher was the first Swiss citizen and first surgeon to ever receive a Nobel Prize in Medicine. He was considered a pioneer and leader in the field of surgery in his time.\nEarly life and personal life.\nChildhood.\nKocher's father was Jakob Alexander Kocher (1814\u20131893), the sixth of seven children to Samuel Kocher (1771\u20131842), a carpenter, and Barbara Sutter (1772\u20131849). Jakob Alexander Kocher was a railway engineer and he moved in 1845 to Burgdorf, Switzerland (near Bern), because of his job as regional engineer of Emmental (\"Bezirksingenieur\"). He was named chief engineer for street and water in the canton of Bern at the age of 34 years and he moved with his family to the capital, the city of Bern. In 1858 he left the states service and managed several engineering projects around Bern.\nTheodor Kocher's mother was Maria Kocher (n\u00e9e Wermuth) living from 1820 to 1900. She was a very religious woman and part of the Moravian Church; together with Jakob Alexander, she raised a family of five sons and one daughter (Theodor Kocher was the second son).\nTheodor Kocher was born on 25 August 1841 in Bern and baptized in the local Bern Minster on 16 September 1841. Together with the family, he moved to Burgdorf in 1845 where he started school. Later his family moved back to Bern where he went to middle and high school (\"Realschule\" and \"Literaturgymnasium\") where he was the first of his class. During high school, Theodor was interested in many subjects and was specifically drawn to art and classical philology but finally decided to become a doctor.\nStudies.\nHe started his studies after obtaining the Swiss Matura in 1858 at the University of Bern where Anton Biermer and Hermann Askan Demme were teaching, two professors that impressed him most. He was a studious and dedicated student but still became a member of the Schweizerischer Zofingerverein, a Swiss fraternity.\nHe obtained his doctorate in Bern in 1865 (March 1865) or 1866 with his dissertation about \"Behandlung der croup\u00f6sen Pneumonie mit Veratrum-Pr\u00e4paraten\" (literal English translation: \"The treatment of croupous pneumonia with Veratrum preparations.\") under professor Biermer with the predicate \"summa cum laude unamimiter\".\nIn spring 1865, Kocher followed his teacher Biermer to Z\u00fcrich, where Theodor Billroth was director of the hospital and influenced Kocher significantly. Kocher then proceeded to start a journey through Europe to meet several of the most famous surgeons of the time. It is not clear how Kocher financed his trip but according to Bonjour (1981) he received money from an unknown female Suisse romande philanthropist who also supported his friend Marc Dufour and was probably a member of the Moravian Church. In October 1865, he traveled to Berlin, passing through Leipzig and visiting an old friend from high school, Hans Blum. In Berlin, he studied under Bernhard von Langenbeck and applied for an assistant position with Langenbeck and Rudolf Virchow. Since there was no position available, in April 1867 Kocher moved on to London where he first met Jonathan Hutchinson and then worked for Henry Thompson and John Erichsen. Furthermore, he was interested in the work of Isaac Baker Brown and Thomas Spencer Wells, who also invited Kocher to go to the opera with his family. In July 1867, he traveled on to Paris to meet Auguste N\u00e9laton, Auguste Verneuil and Louis Pasteur. During his travels, he did not only learn novel techniques but also got to know leading surgeons in person and learned to speak English fluently which allowed him later on to follow the scientific progress in the English speaking world with ease.\nOnce returned to Bern, Kocher prepared for his habilitation and on 12 October 1867, he wrote a petition to the ministry of education to award him the \"venia docendi\" (Latin: \"to instruct\") which was granted to him. He became assistant to Georg L\u00fccke who left Bern in 1872 to become professor in Strasbourg. Kocher was hoping to get his position, but at the time it was customary to appoint German professors to positions at Swiss universities. Accordingly, the faculty suggested Franz K\u00f6nig before Kocher to follow L\u00fccke. However, the students and assistants as well as many doctors preferred Kocher and started a petition to the Bernese government to choose Kocher. Also the press was in favor of Kocher and several famous foreign surgeons, such as Langenbeck from Berlin and Billroth from Vienna, wrote letters in support of Kocher. Under this public pressure, the Bernese government (\"Regierungsrat\") chose Kocher as the successor of L\u00fccke as Ordinary Professor of Surgery and Director of the University Surgical Clinic at the \"Inselspital\" on 16 March 1872, despite a different proposal by the faculty.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1869, Kocher married Marie Witschi-Courant (1841\u20131921) or (1850\u20131925). She was the daughter of Johannes Witschi, who was a merchant, and she had three sons together with Kocher. The Kochers first lived at the Marktgasse in Bern and moved in 1875 to a bigger house in the Villette. The house became a place for friends, colleagues and guests to gather and many patients from Kocher's clinic were invited to dine at the Villette.\nLike his mother, Kocher was a deeply religious man and also part of the Moravian Church. This was an uncommon trait that not many colleagues and co-workers shared and until his death, Kocher attributed all his successes and failures to God. He thought that the rise of materialism (especially in science) was a great evil, and he attributed the outbreak of the First World War.\nKocher was involved in the education of his three sons and played tennis with them and went horseback riding with them. The eldest son Albert (1872\u20131941) would follow him to the surgical clinic in Bern and become Assistant Professor of Surgery.\nOn the evening of 23 July 1917, he was called into the Inselspital for an emergency. Kocher executed the surgery but afterwards felt unwell and went to bed, working on scientific notes. He then fell unconscious and died on 27 July 1917.\nCareer.\nThe call for an ordinary professorship at the University of Bern at the age of 30 was the first big career step for Theodor Kocher. In the 45 years he served as professor at the university, he oversaw the re-building of the famous Bernese Inselspital, published 249 scholarly articles and books, trained numerous medical doctors and treated thousands of patients. He made major contributions to the fields of applied surgery, neurosurgery and, especially, thyroid surgery and endocrinology. For his work he received, among other honors, the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. According to Asher, the field of surgery has transformed radically during the time of Theodore Kocher and later generations will build on the foundations created by Kocher \u2013 if a future historian wanted to describe the state of surgery at the beginning of the 20th century, he only need mention Kocher's \"Text-Book of Operative Surgery\". \nThree main factors contributed to Kocher's success as a surgeon, according to Bonjour (1981). The first factor was his consequent implementation of antiseptic wound treatment which prevented infection and later death of the patients. The second factor, according to Erich Hintzsche, was his monitoring of the anesthesia where he used special masks and later used local anesthesia for goitre surgery which decreased or removed the dangers of anesthesia. As a third factor, Hintzsche mentions the minimal blood loss which Kocher achieved. Even the smallest source of blood during surgery was precisely controlled and inhibited by Kocher, initially because he thought that decomposing blood would constitute an infection risk for the patient. \nEarly career.\nKocher first attained international recognition with his method to reset a dislocated shoulder published in 1870. The new procedure was much less painful and safer than the traditionally used procedure and could be performed by a single physician. Kocher developed the procedure through his knowledge of anatomy. In the same period, Kocher also studied the phenomena of bullet wounds and how they can cause bone fractures. From these studies resulted one public lecture in 1874 \"Die Verbesserung der Geschosse vom Standpunkt der Humanitaet\" (English: \"The improvement of the bullets from the standpoint of humanity.\") and an 1875 manuscript \"Ueber die Sprengwirkung der modernen Kriegsgewehrgeschosse\" (English: \"Over the explosive effect of modern war rifle bullets.\") He showed that small caliber bullets were less harmful and recommended to use bullets with slower speed.\nRelocation of Inselspital and call to Prague.\nAs soon as Kocher became professor, he wanted to modernize the practices at the Bernese Inselspital. He noticed that the old building did not suffice the modern standards and was too small \u2013 half of the patients seeking medical attention had to be turned away. In spring 1878, he visited several institutions around Europe to evaluate novel innovations for hospitals and implement them if possible in Bern. He wrote down his observations in a lengthy report for the Bernese government, giving instructions even for architectonic details. In a speech on 15 November 1878, he informed the general public about the pressing needs of a new hospital building. Finally, he used his call to Prague to pressure the government: He would only stay in Bern if he was either granted 75 beds in the new building or would get money to increase his facilities in the old building. Finally, in the winter of 1884/1885 the new building was finished and the Inselspital could be moved.\nAt the time, Prague had the third largest university clinic in the German speaking world and it was a great honor for Kocher when he received a call as a professor to Prague in spring 1880. Many colleagues, especially international ones, urged Kocher to accept while Bernese doctors and colleagues begged him to stay. Kocher used this call, to demand certain improvements for the university clinic from the Bernese government. They accepted all his demands, the government promised him to begin building the new Inselspital building the next year, increased his credit for surgical equipment and books to 1000 franks and increased the number of beds for Kocher in the new Inselspital. Thus, Kocher decided to stay and many Bernese and Swiss students and professionals thanked him for it. He cited the affection of his students as one of his main reasons for staying. The university students organized a torchlight procession on 8 June 1880 in his honor.\nAseptic surgery.\nIt is unclear whether Kocher directly knew Joseph Lister, who pioneered the antiseptic (using chemical means to kill bacteria) method, but Kocher was in correspondence with him. Kocher had recognized the importance of aseptic techniques early on, introducing them to his peers at a time when this was considered revolutionary. In a hospital report from 1868, he attributed the lower mortality directly to the \"antiseptic Lister's wound bandaging method\" and he could later as director of the clinic order strict adherence to the antiseptic method. Bonjour (1981) describes how his assistants were worried about wound infection for fear of having to explain their failure to Kocher himself. Kocher made it a matter of principle to investigate the cause of every wound infection and remove every potential source of infection, he also banned visitors from his surgeries for this reason.\nHe published multiple works on aseptic treatment and surgery.\nContributions to Neurosurgery.\nKocher also contributed significantly to the field of neurology and neurosurgery. In this area, his research was pioneering and covered the areas of concussion, neurosurgery and intracranial pressure (ICP). Furthermore, he investigated the surgical treatment of epilepsy and spinal and cranial trauma. He found that in some cases, the epilepsy patients had a brain tumor which could be surgically removed. He hypothesized that epilepsy was caused by an increase in ICP and believed that drainage of cerebrospinal fluid could cure epilepsy.\nThe Japanese surgeon Hayazo Ito came to Bern in 1896 in order to perform experimental research on epilepsy. Kocher was especially interested in the ICP during experimentally induced epilepsy and after Ito returned to Japan, he performed over 100 surgeries in epilepsy patients.\nThe American surgeon Harvey Cushing spent several months in the lab of Kocher in 1900, performing cerebral surgery and first encountering the Cushing reflex which describes the relationship between blood pressure and intracranial pressure. Kocher later also found that decompressive craniectomy was an effective method to lower ICP.\nIn his surgery textbook \"Chirurgische Operationslehre\", Kocher dedicated 141 pages of 1060 pages to surgery of the nervous system. It included methods of exploration and decompression of the brain.\nContributions to Thyroid surgery.\nThyroid surgery, which was mostly performed as treatment of goitre with a complete thyroidectomy when possible, was considered a risky procedure when Kocher started his work. Some estimates put the mortality of thyroidectomy as high as 75% in 1872. Indeed, the operation was believed to be one of the most dangerous operations and in France it was prohibited by the Academy of Medicine at the time. Through application of modern surgical methods, such as antiseptic wound treatment and minimizing blood loss, and the famous slow and precise style of Kocher, he managed to reduce the mortality of this operation from an already low 18% (compared to contemporary standards) to less than 0.5% by 1912. By then, Kocher had performed over 5000 thyroid excisions. The success of Kocher's methods, especially when compared to operations performed by Theodor Billroth who was also performing thyroidectomies at that time, was described by William Stewart Halsted as follows:\nKocher and others later discovered that the complete removal of the thyroid could lead to cretinism (termed \"cachexia strumipriva\" by Kocher) caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormones. The phenomena was reported to Kocher first in 1874 by the general practitioner August Fetscherin and later in 1882 by Jacques-Louis Reverdin together with his assistant Auguste Reverdin (1848\u20131908). Reverdin met Kocher on 7 September in Geneva at the international hygienic congress (\"internationaler Hygienekongress\") and expressed his concerns about complete removal of the thyroid to Kocher. Kocher then tried to contact 77 of his 102 former patients and found signs of a physical and mental decay in those cases where he had removed the thyroid gland completely. Ironically, it was his precise surgery that allowed Kocher to remove the thyroid gland almost completely and led to the severe side effects of cretinism.\nKocher came to the conclusion that a complete removal of the thyroid (as it was common to perform at the time because the function of the thyroid was not yet clear) was not advisable, a finding that he made public on 4 April 1883 in a lecture to the German Society of Surgery and also published in 1883 under the title \"Ueber Kropfexstirpation und ihre Folgen\" (English: \"About Thyroidectomies and their consequences\"). Reverdin had already made his findings public on 13 September 1882 and published further articles on this topic in 1883; yet still Kocher never acknowledged Reverdin's priority in this discovery. At the time, the reactions to Kocher's lecture were mixed, some people asserted that goitre and cretinism were different stages of same disease and that cretinism would have occurred independently of the removal of the thyroid in the cases which Kocher described. In the long run however, these observations contributed to a more complete understanding of thyroid function and were one of the early hints of a connection between the thyroid and congenital cretinism. These findings finally enabled thyroid hormone replacement therapies for a variety of thyroid related diseases.\nFurther contributions to science.\nKocher published works on a number of subjects other than the thyroid gland, including hemostasis, antiseptic treatments, surgical infectious diseases, on gunshot wounds, acute osteomyelitis, the theory of strangulated hernia, and abdominal surgery. The Nobel Prize money he received helped him establish the Kocher Institute in Bern. \nA number of instruments (for example the craniometer) and surgical techniques (for example, the Kocher manoeuvre, and kocher incision) are named after him, as well as the Kocher-Debre-Semelaigne syndrome. The Kocher manoeuvre is still a standard practice in orthopaedics. Kocher is also credited for the invention in 1882 of the Kocher's Surgical Clamp, which he used to prevent blood loss during surgery.\nOne of his main works, \"Chirurgische Operationslehre\" (Text-Book of Operative Surgery ), was published through six editions and translated into many languages.\nDuring his life, Kocher published 249 articles and books and supervised more than 130 doctoral candidates. He was rector of the university in 1878 and 1903. He was president of the Bernese and the Swiss physicians association and co-founded the Swiss society for surgery in 1913 and became its first president.\nIn 1904 or 1905 he built a private clinic called \"Ulmenhof\" which had space for 25 patients. Here Kocher catered to the wealthier patients, which in many cases were international. He also treated the wife of Lenin, Nadezhda Krupskaya and operated on her in Bern (in 1913).\nLegacy.\nKocher was also a famous and loved teacher. During nearly 100 semesters he taught his knowledge to about 10 000 students of the University of Bern. He was able to inspire students and taught them to think clearly and logically. Specifically, Kocher also taught a generation of Jewish-Russian students who could not study in Russia. This association with Russia has also led the Russian Geographical Society to name a volcano after him (in the area of Ujun-Choldongi in Manchuria ).\nAmong his many local and international students were\nCarl Arend (Bern),\nOscar Bernhard (St. Moritz), \nAndrea Crotti (Ohio),\nGustave Dardel (Bern),\nCarl Garr\u00e9 (Bonn),\nGottlieb and Max Feurer (St. Gallen),\nAnton Fonio (Langnau), \nWalter Gr\u00f6bly (Arbon),\nCarl Kaufmann (Z\u00fcrich),\nAlbert Kocher (Bern),\nJoseph Kopp (Luzern),\nErnst Kummer (Geneva),\nOtto Lanz (Amsterdam), \nEdmond Lardy (Geneva) \nJakob Lauper (Interlaken),\nAlbert L\u00fcthi (Thun),\nHermann Matti (Bern),\nCharles Pettavel (Neuenburg),\nPaul Pf\u00e4hler (Olten),\nFritz de Quervain (La Chaux de Fonds / Basel / Bern),\nAugust Rickli (Langenthal),\nErnst Rieben (Interlaken),\nAugust Rollier (Leysin), \nC\u00e9sar Roux (Lausanne),\nKarl Schuler (Rorschach), \nFritz Steinmann (Bern),\nAlbert Vogel (Luzern),\nHans Wildbolz (Bern) as well as \nthe American neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing. Other notable students of his include Hayazo Ito (1865\u20131929) and S. Berezowsky which also spread his techniques in their respective home-countries (Japan and Russia).\nKocher's name is living on with the Theodor Kocher Institute, the Kochergasse and the Kocher Park in Bern. In the Inselspital, there is a bust of Kocher, created by in 1927. In the Kocher Park there is another bust, created by .\nIn 1950, the Swiss historian Edgar Bonjour (1898\u20131991) who was married to Dora Kocher wrote a 136-page monograph on Kocher's life that was extended again in 1981.\nWorks.\nDuring his life, Kocher published 249 articles and books and supervised more than 130 doctoral candidates. The following is an incomplete list of his most important works:"}
{"id": "10474", "revid": "612852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10474", "title": "Eight queens puzzle", "text": "The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8\u00d78 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. There are 92 solutions. The problem was first posed in the mid-19th century. In the modern era, it is often used as an example problem for various computer programming techniques.\nThe eight queens puzzle is a special case of the more general \"n\" queens problem of placing \"n\" non-attacking queens on an \"n\"\u00d7\"n\" chessboard. Solutions exist for all natural numbers \"n\" with the exception of \"n\" = 2 and \"n\" = 3. Although the exact number of solutions is only known for \"n\" \u2264 27, the asymptotic growth rate of the number of solutions is approximately (0.143 \"n\")\"n\".\nHistory.\nChess composer Max Bezzel published the eight queens puzzle in 1848. Franz Nauck published the first solutions in 1850. Nauck also extended the puzzle to the \"n\" queens problem, with \"n\" queens on a chessboard of \"n\"\u00d7\"n\" squares.\nSince then, many mathematicians, including Carl Friedrich Gauss, have worked on both the eight queens puzzle and its generalized \"n\"-queens version. In 1874, S. G\u00fcnther proposed a method using determinants to find solutions. J.W.L. Glaisher refined Gunther's approach.\nIn 1972, Edsger Dijkstra used this problem to illustrate the power of what he called structured programming. He published a highly detailed description of a depth-first backtracking algorithm.\nConstructing and counting solutions when \"n\" = 8.\nThe problem of finding all solutions to the 8-queens problem can be quite computationally expensive, as there are 4,426,165,368 possible arrangements of eight queens on an 8\u00d78 board, but only 92 solutions. It is possible to use shortcuts that reduce computational requirements or rules of thumb that avoids brute-force computational techniques. For example, by applying a simple rule that chooses one queen from each column, it is possible to reduce the number of possibilities to 16,777,216 (that is, 88) possible combinations. Generating permutations further reduces the possibilities to just 40,320 (that is, 8!), which can then be checked for diagonal attacks.\nThe eight queens puzzle has 92 distinct solutions. If solutions that differ only by the symmetry operations of rotation and reflection of the board are counted as one, the puzzle has 12 solutions. These are called \"fundamental\" solutions; representatives of each are shown below.\nA fundamental solution usually has eight variants (including its original form) obtained by rotating 90, 180, or 270\u00b0 and then reflecting each of the four rotational variants in a mirror in a fixed position. However, one of the 12 fundamental solutions (solution 12 below) is identical to its own 180\u00b0 rotation, so has only four variants (itself and its reflection, its 90\u00b0 rotation and the reflection of that). Thus, the total number of distinct solutions is 11\u00d78 + 1\u00d74 = 92.\nAll fundamental solutions are presented below:\nSolution 10 has the additional property that no three queens are in a straight line.\nExistence of solutions.\nBrute-force algorithms to count the number of solutions are computationally manageable for , but would be intractable for problems of , as 20! = 2.433 \u00d7 1018. If the goal is to find a single solution, one can show solutions exist for all \"n\" \u2265 4 with no search whatsoever.\nThese solutions exhibit stair-stepped patterns, as in the following examples for \"n\" = 8, 9 and 10:\nThe examples above can be obtained with the following formulas. Let (\"i\", \"j\") be the square in column \"i\" and row \"j\" on the \"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" chessboard, \"k\" an integer.\nOne approach is\nFor this results in fundamental solution 1 above. A few more examples follow.\nCounting solutions for other sizes \"n\".\nExact enumeration.\nThere is no known formula for the exact number of solutions for placing \"n\" queens on an board i.e. the number of independent sets of size \"n\" in an queen's graph. The 27\u00d727 board is the highest-order board that has been completely enumerated. The following tables give the number of solutions to the \"n\" queens problem, both fundamental and all , for all known cases.\nThe number of placements in which furthermore no three queens lie on any straight line is known for formula_1 .\nAsymptotic enumeration.\nIn 2021, Michael Simkin proved that for large numbers \"n\", the number of solutions of the \"n\" queens problem is approximately formula_2. More precisely, the number formula_3 of solutions has asymptotic growth\nformula_4\nwhere formula_5 is a constant that lies between 1.939 and 1.945. (Here \"o\"(1) represents little o notation.)\nIf one instead considers a toroidal chessboard (where diagonals \"wrap around\" from the top edge to the bottom and from the left edge to the right), it is only possible to place \"n\" queens on an formula_6 board if formula_7 In this case, the asymptotic number of solutions is\nformula_8\nExercise in algorithm design.\nFinding all solutions to the eight queens puzzle is a good example of a simple but nontrivial problem. For this reason, it is often used as an example problem for various programming techniques, including nontraditional approaches such as constraint programming, logic programming or genetic algorithms. Most often, it is used as an example of a problem that can be solved with a recursive algorithm, by phrasing the \"n\" queens problem inductively in terms of adding a single queen to any solution to the problem of placing \"n\"\u22121 queens on an \"n\"\u00d7\"n\" chessboard. The induction bottoms out with the solution to the 'problem' of placing 0 queens on the chessboard, which is the empty chessboard.\nThis technique can be used in a way that is much more efficient than the na\u00efve brute-force search algorithm, which considers all 648\u00a0=\u00a0248\u00a0= 281,474,976,710,656 possible blind placements of eight queens, and then filters these to remove all placements that place two queens either on the same square (leaving only 64!/56!\u00a0= 178,462,987,637,760 possible placements) or in mutually attacking positions. This very poor algorithm will, among other things, produce the same results over and over again in all the different permutations of the assignments of the eight queens, as well as repeating the same computations over and over again for the different sub-sets of each solution. A better brute-force algorithm places a single queen on each row, leading to only 88\u00a0=\u00a0224\u00a0= 16,777,216 blind placements.\nIt is possible to do much better than this.\nOne algorithm solves the eight rooks puzzle by generating the permutations of the numbers 1 through 8 (of which there are 8! = 40,320), and uses the elements of each permutation as indices to place a queen on each row.\nThen it rejects those boards with diagonal attacking positions.\nThe backtracking depth-first search program, a slight improvement on the permutation method, constructs the search tree by considering one row of the board at a time, eliminating most nonsolution board positions at a very early stage in their construction.\nBecause it rejects rook and diagonal attacks even on incomplete boards, it examines only 15,720 possible queen placements.\nA further improvement, which examines only 5,508 possible queen\nplacements, is to combine the permutation based method with the early\npruning method: the permutations are generated depth-first, and\nthe search space is pruned if the partial permutation produces a\ndiagonal attack.\nConstraint programming can also be very effective on this problem.\nAn alternative to exhaustive search is an 'iterative repair' algorithm, which typically starts with all queens on the board, for example with one queen per column. It then counts the number of conflicts (attacks), and uses a heuristic to determine how to improve the placement of the queens. The 'minimum-conflicts' heuristic \u2013 moving the piece with the largest number of conflicts to the square in the same column where the number of conflicts is smallest \u2013 is particularly effective: it easily finds a solution to even the 1,000,000 queens problem.\nUnlike the backtracking search outlined above, iterative repair does not guarantee a solution: like all greedy procedures, it may get stuck on a local optimum. (In such a case, the algorithm may be restarted with a different initial configuration.) On the other hand, it can solve problem sizes that are several orders of magnitude beyond the scope of a depth-first search.\nAs an alternative to backtracking, solutions can be counted by recursively enumerating valid partial solutions, one row at a time. Rather than constructing entire board positions, blocked diagonals and columns are tracked with bitwise operations. This does not allow the recovery of individual solutions.\nSample program.\nThe following program is a translation of Niklaus Wirth's solution into the Python programming language, but does without the index arithmetic found in the original and instead uses lists to keep the program code as simple as possible.

Bombieri is currently professor emeritus in the School of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Bombieri won the Fields Medal in 1974 for his work on the large sieve and its application to the distribution of prime numbers.\nCareer.\nBombieri published his first mathematical paper in 1957, when he was 16 years old. In 1963, at age 22, he earned his first degree (Laurea) in mathematics from the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano under the supervision of Giovanni Ricci and then studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, with Harold Davenport.\nBombieri was an assistant professor (1963\u20131965) and then a full professor (1965\u20131966) at the Universit\u00e0 di Cagliari, at the Universit\u00e0 di Pisa in 1966\u20131974, and then at the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa in 1974\u20131977. From Pisa, he emigrated in 1977 to the United States, where he became a professor at the School of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In 2011, he became professor emeritus.\nBombieri is also known for his \"pro bono\" service on behalf of the mathematics profession, e.g. for serving on external review boards and for peer-reviewing extraordinarily complicated manuscripts (like the paper of Per Enflo on the invariant subspace problem).\nResearch.\nThe Bombieri\u2013Vinogradov theorem is one of the major applications of the large sieve method. It improves Dirichlet's theorem on prime numbers in arithmetic progressions, by showing that by averaging over the modulus over a range, the mean error is much less than can be proved in a given case. This result can sometimes substitute for the still-unproved generalized Riemann hypothesis.\nIn 1969, Bombieri, De Giorgi, and Giusti solved Bernstein's problem on minimal surfaces in dimensions above eight.\nIn 1976, Bombieri developed the technique known as the \"asymptotic sieve\". In 1980, he supplied the completion of the proof of the uniqueness of finite groups of Ree type in characteristic 3; at the time of its publication, it was one of the missing steps in the classification of finite simple groups.\nAwards.\nBombieri's research in number theory, algebraic geometry, and mathematical analysis has earned him many international prizes \u2014 a Fields Medal in 1974 and the Balzan Prize in 1980. He was a plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians, which took place in 1974 in Vancouver. He is a member, or foreign member, of several learned academies, including the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei (elected 1976), the French Academy of Sciences (elected 1984), the Academia Europaea (elected 1995), and the United States National Academy of Sciences (elected 1996). In 2002 he was made \"Cavaliere di Gran Croce al Merito della Repubblica Italiana\". In 2010, he received the King Faisal International Prize (jointly with Terence Tao). and in 2020 he was awarded the Crafoord Prize in Mathematics.\nOther interests.\nBombieri, accomplished also in the arts, explored for wild orchids and other plants as a hobby in the Alps when a young man."}
{"id": "10477", "revid": "43066271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10477", "title": "Eos", "text": "In ancient Greek mythology and religion, Eos (; Ionic and Homeric Greek \"\u0112\u1e53s\", Attic \"H\u00e9\u014ds\", \"dawn\", or ; Aeolic \"A\u00fa\u014ds\", Doric \"\u0100\u1e53s\") is the goddess and personification of the dawn, who rose each morning from her home at the edge of the river Oceanus to deliver light and disperse the night. In Greek tradition and poetry, she is characterized as a goddess with a great sexual appetite, who took numerous human lovers for her own satisfaction and bore them several children. Like her Roman counterpart Aurora and Rigvedic Ushas, Eos continues the name of an earlier Indo-European dawn goddess, Hausos. Eos, or her earlier Proto-Indo-European (PIE) ancestor, also shares several elements with the love goddess Aphrodite, perhaps signifying Eos's influence on her or otherwise a common origin for the two goddesses. In surviving tradition, Aphrodite is the culprit behind Eos' numerous love affairs, having cursed the goddess with insatiable lust for mortal men.\nIn Greek literature, Eos is presented as a daughter of the Titans Hyperion and Theia, the sister of the sun god Helios and the moon goddess Selene. In rarer traditions, she is the daughter of the Titan Pallas. Each day she drives her two-horse chariot, heralding the breaking of the new day and her brother's arrival. Thus, her most common epithet of the goddess in the Homeric epics is Rhododactylos, or \"rosy-fingered\", a reference to the sky's colours at dawn, and Erigeneia, \"early-born\". Although primarily associated with the dawn and early morning, sometimes Eos would accompany Helios for the entire duration of his journey, and thus she is even seen during dusk.\nEos fell in love with mortal men several times, and would abduct them in similar manner to how male gods did mortal women. Her most notable mortal lover is the Trojan prince Tithonus, for whom she ensured the gift of immortality, but not eternal youth, leading to him aging without dying for an eternity. In another story, she carried off the Athenian Cephalus against his will, but eventually let him go for he ardently wished to be returned to his wife, though not before she denigrated her to him, leading to the couple parting ways. Several other lovers and romances with both mortal men and gods were attributed to the goddess by various poets throughout the centuries.\nEos figures in many works of ancient literature and poetry, but despite her Proto-Indo-European origins, there is little evidence of Eos having received any cult or being the centre of worship during classical times.\nEtymology.\nThe Proto-Greek form of \"\u1f28\u03ce\u03c2\" / \"\u0112\u1e53s\" has been reconstructed as \"*\u1f00\u03c5h\u03ce\u03c2 / auh\u1e53s\". It is cognate to the Vedic goddess \"Ushas\", Lithuanian goddess \"Au\u0161rin\u0117\", and Roman goddess \"Aurora\" (Old Latin \"Ausosa\"), all three of whom are also goddesses of the dawn. Meissner (2006) suggested an \"\u00e1ww\u0254\u0304s\" &gt; /a\u1e77w\u0254\u0304s/ &gt; lengthening for Aeolic and */a\u1e77w\u0254\u0304s/ &gt; \"*\u0101w\u0254\u0304s\" &gt; \"*\u01e3w\u0254\u0304s\" &gt; /\u01e3\u0254\u0304s/ for Attic-Ionic Greek.\nIn Greek dialects.\nIn Mycenaean Greek her name is also attested in the form in Linear B, \"a-wo-i-jo\" (\"\u0100w(\u02b0)o\u02b0ios\"; \u1f08\u03ddoh\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2), found in a tablet from Pylos; it has been interpreted as a shepherd's personal name related to \"dawn\", or dative form \"\u0100w\u014di\u014di\".\nFormer proposals.\nHeinrich Wilhelm Stoll offered a different (now rejected) etymology for \"\", linking it to the verb , meaning \"to blow\", \"to breathe.\"\nLycophron calls her by an archaic name, \"Tito\", meaning \"day\" and perhaps etymologically linked to \"Titan\". Karl Kerenyi observes that Tito shares a linguistic origin with Eos's lover Tithonus, which belonged to an older, pre-Greek language.\nOrigins.\nProto-Indo-European dawn goddess.\nAll four of the aforementioned goddesses sharing a linguistic connection with Eos are considered derivatives of the Proto-Indo-European stem \"*h\u2082ews\u1e53s\" (later \"*Aus\u1e53s\"), \"dawn\". The root also gave rise to Proto-Germanic \"*Austr\u014d\", Old High German \"*\u014cstara\" and Old English \"\u0112ostre / \u0112astre\". These and other cognates led to the reconstruction of a Proto-Indo-European dawn goddess, \"*h\u2082\u00e9ws\u014ds\".\nIn the Greek pantheon, Eos, Helios and Zeus are the three gods that are of impeccable Indo-European lineage in both etymology and status, although the former two were sidelined in the pantheon by non-PIE newcomers. A common epithet associated with this dawn goddess is *\"Diw\u00f3s Dhu\u01f5h2t\u1e17r\", the 'Daughter of Dy\u0113us', the sky god. In Homeric tradition however, Eos is never stated to be the daughter of Zeus (, ), as she is instead the daughter of the Titan Hyperion, who plays little role in mythology or religion. Rather, a commonly occurring epithet of hers is , \"d\u00eea\", meaning \"divine\", from earlier \"*d\u00edw-ya\", which would have translated into \"belonging to Zeus\" or \"heavenly\".\nEos's characterization as a lovestruck, sexual being who took many lovers is directly inherited from her PIE precursor. A common and widespread theme among Hausos's descendants is their reluctance to bring the light of the new day. Eos (and Aurora) is sometimes seen as unwilling to leave her bed in the morning, while U\u1e63as is punished by Indra for attempting to forestall the day, and the Latvian Auseklis was said to be locked up in a golden chamber so she could not always rise in the morning.\nThis Indo-European goddess of the dawn was often conflated and equated with Hemera, the goddess of the day and daylight. Eos might have also played a role in Proto-Indo-European poetry.\nConnection to Aphrodite.\nEos also shares some characteristics with the love goddess Aphrodite connoting perhaps a semi-shared origin or influence of Eos/\"*Ha\u00e9us\u014ds\" on Aphrodite, who otherwise has a Near Eastern origin; both goddesses were known for their erotic beauty and aggressive sexuality, both had relationships with mortal lovers, and both were associated with the colors red, white, and gold. Michael Janda etymologizes Aphrodite's name as an epithet of Eos meaning \"she who rises from the foam [of the ocean]\" and points to Hesiod's \"Theogony\" account of Aphrodite's birth as an archaic reflex of Indo-European myth. On the other hand, however, it is generally accepted that Aphrodite's name etymology is Semitic in origin, and its exact meaning and derivation cannot be determined. Evidence is also provided by an Italic red-figure krater in which Aphrodite is shown holding a mirror beneath a solar disc while the Theban hero Cadmus slays the dragon, with a female figure nearly identical to Aphrodite being depicted on another krater labelled \"\", or \"A\u1e53s\", the dawn; this shows that although Aphrodite is assimilated to Astarte/Inanna, in Greek artistic tradition she is sometimes presented in a similar matter to Eos.\nAphrodite, like Eos, is predator and not prey, as no tales of men assaulting Aphrodite exist, but there are many where she abducts mortal men reversing the traditional theme of gods and men pursuing maidens, in the same fashion as Eos. Not only does Aphrodite abduct or seduce mortal men as Eos does, but even cites Eos' own adventures with Tithonus when she seduces Anchises. The two goddesses are presented as both maleficent and beneficent abductors, as they confer both death (maleficent) and preservation (beneficent) to their mortal lovers. The two goddesses exist almost side by side in the myth of Phaethon of Syria, with Eos as his mother and Aphrodite as his lover and abductor. Moreover, another telling point is how the name \u201cAoos\u201d is recorded as both a name for Adonis, Aphrodite's East-originating lover, and a son of Eos by Cephalus (like Phaethon) who became king of Cyprus, an island that was regarded as Aphrodite's birthplace. This suggest a mixture of Mycenaean and Phoenician religions on the island; it is possible that Aoos was originally a generic name used for Eos\u2019 son or lover, which was then attached to Aphrodite in the form of a consort of the same name as she developed from Eos.\nDescription.\nEos is usually described with rosy fingers or rosy forearms as she opened the gates of heaven for the Sun to rise: the singer in the \"Homeric Hymn to Helios\" calls her (), \"rosy-armed\", as does Sappho, who also describes her as having golden arms and golden sandals; vases depict her rosy-fingered, with golden arms.\nShe is pictured on Attic vases as a beautiful woman, crowned with a tiara or diadem and with the large white-feathered wings of a bird. In Homer, her saffron-colored robe is embroidered or woven with flowers. Mesomedes of Crete used for her, \"she who has snow-white eyelids\", while Ovid described her as \"golden\". The delicate and fragile beauty of her appearance seems to be in total contrast with the carnal nature that was often attributed to her in myth and literature.\nFamily.\nParents.\nAccording to Greek cosmogony, Eos is the daughter of the Titans Hyperion and Theia: Hyperion, a bringer of light, the \"One Above, Who Travels High Above the Earth\" and Theia, \"The Divine,\" also called Euryphaessa, \"wide-shining\" and Aethra, \"bright sky\". Eos is the sister of Helios, the god of the sun, and Selene, the goddess of the moon, \"who shine upon all that are on earth and upon the deathless gods who live in the wide heaven\". Out of the four authors that give her and her siblings a birth order, two make her the oldest child, the other two the youngest. In some accounts, Eos's father was called Pallas, who is also confirmed to be the father of Eos's sister Selene in some rare traditions. Even though the two goddesses are still connected as sisters in the traditions going with lineage from Pallas, their brother Helios is never included with them in those versions, being consistently the son of Hyperion. Mesomedes made her the daughter of Helios, who is usually her brother, by an unnamed mother. Some authors made her the child of Nyx, the personification of the night, who is the mother of Hemera in the \"Theogony\".\nOffspring.\nEos married the Titan Astraeus (\"of the stars\") and became the mother of the Anemoi (\"winds\") namely Zephyrus, Boreas, Notus and Eurus; of the Morning Star, Eosphoros (Venus); of the stars; and of the virgin goddess of justice, Astraea (\"starry one\"). Her other notable offspring were Memnon and Emathion by the Trojan prince, Tithonus. Sometimes, Hesperus, Phaethon and Tithonus (different from her lover), were said to be the children of Eos by Prince Cephalus of Athens.\nMythology.\nGoddess of the dawn.\nEach morning, the dawn goddess Eos gets up and opens the gates for her brother, Helios, to pass through and rise, ushering in the new day. Although often her job seems to be done once she announces Helios' coming, in the Homeric epics she accompanies him throughout the whole day, and does not leave him until the sunset; hence \"Eos\" might be used in texts where one would have expected to see \"Helios\" instead. In Musaeus's rendition of the story of Hero and Leander in the sixth century AD, Eos is mentioned during both sunrise and sunset.\nHomer and Hesiod.\nFrom the \"Iliad\":\nNow when Dawn in robe of saffron was hastening from the streams of Oceanus, to bring light to mortals and immortals, Thetis reached the ships with the armor that the god had given her.\nBut soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, then gathered the folk about the pyre of glorious Hector.\nShe is most often associated with her Homeric epithet \"rosy-fingered\" Eos Rhododactylos (), but Homer also calls her Eos Erigeneia:\nThat brightest of stars appeared, Eosphoros, that most often heralds the light of early-rising Dawn (Eos Erigeneia).\nNear the end of the \"Odyssey\", Athena, wanting to buy Odysseus some time with his wife Penelope after they have reunited with each other, orders Eos not to yoke her two horses, thus delaying the coming of the new day:\nAnd rose-fingered Dawn would have shone for the weepers had not bright-eyed goddess Athena thought of other things. She checked the long night in its passage, and further, held golden-throned Dawn over Ocean and didn't let her yoke her swift-footed horses, that bring daylight to men, Lampus and Phaethon, the colts that carry Dawn.\nIn the \"Theogony\", Hesiod wrote \"[a]nd after these Erigeneia [\"Early-born\"] bore the star Eosphoros (\"Dawn-bringer\"), and the gleaming stars with which heaven is crowned\". Thus Eos is preceded by the Morning Star, and is thus seen as the genetrix of all the stars and planets; her tears are considered to have created the morning dew, personified as Ersa or Herse, who is otherwise the daughter of her sister Selene by Zeus.\nOrphic literature.\nEos is addressed by the singer in one of the \"Orphic Hymns\", as the bringer of the new day:\nThe position of the hymn in the collection at number 78 is odd, far from the Hymns to the Night (3), the Sun (8) and the Moon (9), where it would be expected to be grouped. While many of the \"Orphic Hymns\" describe the divinities in terms on light, the hymn to Eos is the only one that calls upon the divinity to provide light to the initiates.\nDivine horses.\nEos's team of horses pull her chariot across the sky and are named in the \"Odyssey\" as \"Firebright\" and \"Daybright\". Quintus described her exulting in her heart over the radiant horses (Lampus and Pha\u00ebton) that drew her chariot, amidst the bright-haired Horae, the feminine Hours, the daughters of Zeus and Themis who are responsible for the changing of the seasons, climbing the arc of heaven and scattering sparks of fire.\nLovers.\nIn spite of the goddess already having a husband in the face of her first cousin Astraeus, Eos is presented as a goddess who fell in love several times. According to Pseudo-Apollodorus, it was the jealous Aphrodite who cursed her to be perpetually in love and have an insatiable sexual desire because Eos had once lain with Aphrodite's sweetheart Ares, the god of war. The curse caused her to abduct a number of handsome young men. This explanatory myth was the reason offered for Eos' ravenous sexual desires, as this pattern of behavior of hers was noticed by the ancient Greeks.\nIn the Odyssey, Calypso complains to Hermes about the male gods taking many mortal women as lovers, but not allowing goddesses to do the same. She brings up as example Eos's love for the hunter Orion, who was killed by Artemis on the island of Ortygia. Apollodorus also mentions Eos's love for Orion, and adds that she brought him to Delos, where he met Artemis and was subsequently slain by her. The good-looking Cleitus was snatched and made immortal by her.\nEos fell in love and abducted Cephalus, a son of Hermes, who is sometimes the same as or distinct from the Cephalus that was the husband of Procris, whom she also abducted.\nTithonus.\nThe myth about the love of Eos and Tithonus is very old, known as early as Homer, who in the \"Odyssey\" described the coming of the new morning as Eos rising from the bed she shares with Tithonus to bring her light to the world. The earliest (and fullest) account survives in the \"Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite\", where Aphrodite herself narrates the story to her own lover Anchises. Additionally, the myth is also the subject of one of the very few substantially complete works of Sappho, pieced together from different fragments discovered over a period of more than a hundred years, known as the Tithonus poem or the Old Age poem:\nThe myth goes that Eos fell in love with and abducted Tithonus, a handsome prince from Troy, either the brother or the son of King Laomedon (the father of Priam). She went with a request to Zeus, asking him to make Tithonus immortal for her sake. Zeus agreed and granted her wish, but Eos foolishly forgot to ask for eternal youth as well for her beloved. So for a while the two lived happily in her palace, but their happiness eventually came to an end when Tithonus\u2019 hair started turning grey as he aged, and Eos ceased to visit him in their bed. Despite that, the goddess kept him around and nourished him with food and ambrosia; Tithonus never died as he had gained immortality as Zeus promised, but he kept aging and shrivelling, and was soon unable to even move. In the end, Eos locked him up in a chamber, where he withered away alone, forever a helpless old man. Out of pity, she turned him into a small bug, a cicada (Greek , \"tettix\").\nIn the account of Hieronymus of Rhodes from the third century BC, the blame is shifted from Eos and onto Tithonus, who asked for immortality but not agelessness from his lover, who was then unable to help him otherwise and turned him into a cicada. Propertius wrote that Eos did not forsake Tithonus, old and aged as he was, and would still embrace him and hold him in her arms rather than leaving him deserted in his cold chamber, while cursing the gods for his cruel fate.\nThis myth might have been used to explain why cicadas were particularly noisy during the early hours of the morning, when the dawn appears in the sky. Sir James George Frazer notes that there was a widespread notion among the ancient Greeks and other ancient peoples that the creatures that shed their skin renew their youth and get to live forever. It could also be a reference to the fact that the high-pitched talk of old men was compared to a cicada's singing, as evidenced in a passage from the \"Iliad\". The ancient Greeks would use a cicada, the most musical of insects, sitting on a harp as an emblem of music. Cicadas were also believed to be able to survive off of dew alone, a substance closely associated with Eos.\nCephalus.\nThe abduction of Cephalus had special appeal for an Athenian audience because Cephalus was a local boy, and so this myth element appeared frequently in Attic vase-paintings and was exported with them. In the literary myths, Eos snatched Cephalus against his will when he was hunting and took him to Syria. Although Cephalus was already married to Procris, Eos bore him three sons, including Phaethon and Hesperus, and in some versions the little-attested Aoos who went on to become king of Cyprus, but he then began pining for Procris, causing a disgruntled Eos to return him to Procris, but not before sowing the seeds of doubt in his mind, telling him that it was highly unlikely that Procris had stayed faithful to him this entire time.\nCephalus, troubled by her words, asked Eos to change his form into that of a stranger's, in order to secretly put Procris's love for him to the test. Cephalus, now disguised, propositioned Procris, who at first declined but eventually gave in when he offered her money. He was hurt by her betrayal, and she left him in shame, but eventually they got back together. This time however it was Procris's turn to doubt her husband's fidelity; while hunting, he would often call upon the breeze ('Aura' in Latin, sounding similar to Eos's Roman equivalent Aurora) to refresh his body. Upon hearing that, Procris followed and spied on him. Cephalus, mistaking her for some wild animal, threw his spear at her, killing his wife. The second-century CE traveller Pausanias knew of the story of Cephalus's abduction too, though he calls Eos by the name of Hemera, goddess of day.\nHyginus omits the kidnapping from the story, and has Cephalus reject Eos out of fidelity to Procris when she begs him to have sex with her. Eos then says to Cephalus that she would not want him to break his vows if Procris herself has not either, and alters his appearance and gives him gifts to trick Procris. Cephalus then goes to Procris as a stranger, and she agrees to lay with him, thereupon Eos removes the enchantment from Cephalus, revealing his identity. Procris, knowing she has been deceived by Eos, flees; she is eventually reunited with Cephalus, but still fearful of Eos, follows him when he goes out hunting, and ends up being accidentally killed by him.\nAntoninus Liberalis also largely follows the same tradition in his rendition of the myth, though his text contains a lacuna, jumping from Eos' abduction of Cephalus to him having doubts over Procris. The oldest extant account of the myth is attributed to Pherecydes, and the elements it contains were all kept by later poets; in his account however Eos plays no role in the myth. That being said, artistic evidence of Eos abducting a man that can be identified as Cephalus go as back as the early fifth century BC.\nRole in wars.\nGigantomachy.\nEos played a small role in the battle of the earthborn Giants against the gods, known as the Gigantomachy, who rose in rebellion. When their mother, the earth goddess Gaia learned of a prophecy that the giants would perish at the hand of a mortal, Gaia sought to find a herb that would protect them from all harm; thus Zeus ordered Eos, as well as her siblings Selene (Moon) and Helios (Sun) not to shine so that she would not be able to seek for it, and harvested all of the plant for himself, denying Gaia the chance to make the Giants indestructible. Moreover, Eos is seen fighting against the Giants in the south frieze of the Pergamon Altar, which depicts the Gigantomachy, where she rides hither on either a horse or a mule right ahead of Helios, swinging herself on the back of her mount while a Giant already lies on the ground underneath her; a robe wound around her hips serves as her saddle-cloth. She is joined in fight against the Giants by her siblings, her mother Theia, and possibly, conjectured due to the disembodied wing to the right of Eos's shoulder, the goddess Hemera.\nTrojan War.\nAccording to Hesiod, by her lover Tithonus, Eos had two sons, Memnon and Emathion. Memnon, king of Aethiopia, joined the Trojans in the Trojan War and fought against Achilles in battle. Much like Thetis, the mother of Achilles, did before her, Eos asked the smithing god Hephaestus with tears in her eyes to forge an armor for Memnon, and he, moved, did as told. Pausanias mentions images of Thetis and Eos both begging Zeus on behalf of their sons. In the end, it was Achilles who triumphed and slew Memnon in battle. Mourning greatly over the death of her son, Eos made the light of her brother, Helios the god of the sun, to fade, and begged Nyx, the goddess of the night, to come out earlier, so she could be able to freely steal her son's body undetected by the armies. After his death, Eos, perhaps with the help of Hypnos (Sleep) and Thanatos (Death), transported Memnon's dead body back to Aethiopia; she also asked Zeus to make her son immortal, and he granted her wish. Eos' role in the Trojan War saga mirrors that of Thetis herself; both are goddesses married to aging old men, both see their mortal sons die on the battlefield, and both arrange an afterlife/immortality of sorts for said sons.\nIconography.\nEos was imagined as a woman wearing a saffron mantle as she spread dew from an upturned urn, or with a torch in hand, riding a chariot. Greek and Italian vases show Eos/Aurora on a chariot preceding Helios, as the morning star Eosphorus flies with her; she is winged, wearing a fine pleated tunic and mantle. Eos is not an uncommon figure, especially on red-figure vases; as a single figure she appears rising from the sea in, or driving, a four-horse chariot like her brother Helios, sometimes carrying two hydriae from which she pours morning dew. Because Hermes' rod had the power to both induce sleep to mortals and wake them up, some times he is seen preceding the chariot of Eos (and that of Helios) as the new day breaks.\nAlthough the romantic adventures of Eos is a common subject in pottery, so far as it is known, no vase depicts her with Orion or Cleitus, known lovers of hers, instead those vases fall into groups; those that depict Eos with a young hunter identified as Cephalus, and those that depict Eos with a youth holding a lyre, identified as Tithonus. Sometimes those vases bear inscriptions, and on a few the hunter is identified as Tithonus, while the lyre-player is Cephalus. Perhaps the earliest representation of this theme is found on a red-figure \"rhyton\", a statuette-vase, from circa 480-470 BC in which Eos is depicted carrying of a naked boy, perhaps Cephalus, her wings spread and her feet barely touching the ground. The image of Eos pursuing Tithonus was eerily repetitive in ancient art, as was that of erotic pursuit in general; Tithonus was drawn running off to the right in terror, or trying to clobber with a lyre or a spear the pursuing Eos, indicating the terrifying aspect of a mortal man being taken by a goddess. The image of Zeus, the active \"erastes\", pursuing Ganymede, the passive \"eromenos\", was also common, but in the case of Eos, the female figure was put in the dominant position.\nOther depictions of mythological scenes that include Eos are Memnon's battle with Achilles and Eos' pleading of Zeus for his safety, her seizing of Memnon's dead body, and the \"apotheosis\" of Alcmene (the mother of Heracles). Among Theia and Hyperion's children, she is the only one depicted with wings, as neither her brother nor her sister ever sport some in art.\nCult and temples.\nEos, along with her brother and sister, is an Indo-European deity, side-lined by the non-IE newcomers to the pantheon; James Davidson argues that apparently persisting on the sidelines was a primary function for them, to be the minor gods that the major gods were juxtaposed to, thus helping to keep the Greek religion Greek. However, whereas her brother and sister did receive minor cults, and in Helios' case even major ones, Eos does not seem to have been the focus of any worship at all. Thus there are no known temples, shrines, or altars to Eos. That being said, Ovid seems to allude to the existence of at least two shrines of Eos, as he describes them in plural, albeit few, in the lines:\nAlthough this could simply be an understated way for Eos to say that she has no temples or shrines whatsoever, nevertheless Ovid may therefore have known of at least two such shrines. However, if Eos did indeed have a handful of shrines and altars in ancient Greece or Rome, no knowledge of them remains.\nThe only traces of the goddess's worship can be found at Athens, where wineless offerings (or \"nephalia\") were made to Eos, along with other celestial gods and goddesses, including Eos's siblings Helios and Selene, as well as Aphrodite Urania, Mnemosyne, the Muses, and the nymphs. It is possible that the goddess addressed as Orthria and Aotis in a fragment by Alcman is Eos; this is highly debated, but if true, it could mean that Eos was worshipped in some capacity in Sparta during the Archaic period.\nIdentifications.\nEtruscan.\nAmong the Etruscans, the generative dawn-goddess was Thesan. Depictions of the dawn-goddess with a young lover became popular in Etruria in the fifth century, probably inspired by imported Greek vase-painting. Though Etruscans preferred to show the goddess as a nurturer (\"Kourotrophos\") rather than an abductor of young men, the late Archaic sculptural acroterion from Etruscan C\u00e6re, now in Berlin, showing the goddess in archaic running pose adapted from the Greeks, and bearing a boy in her arms, has commonly been identified as Eos and Cephalus. On an Etruscan mirror Thesan is shown carrying off a young man, whose name is inscribed as Tinthu.\nRoman.\nThe Roman equivalent of Eos is Aurora, also a cognate showing the characteristic Latin rhotacism. Dawn became associated in Roman cult with Matuta, later known as Mater Matuta. She was also associated with the sea harbors and ports, and had a temple on the Forum Boarium. On June 11, the Matralia was celebrated at that temple in honor of Mater Matuta; this festival was only for women during their first marriage.\nHemera.\nAlthough distinct deities in early works such as Hesiod's \"Theogony\", later the tragic poets completely identified Eos with Hemera, the primordial goddess of the day; each of the three great Athenian tragedians, Euripides, Aeschylus and Sophocles, used \"Hemera\" for the goddess who abducts Tithonus or drives a chariot drawn by white horses at daybreak in some work.\nBoth goddesses were said to be daughters of Nyx (Night), albeit Eos was much more commonly the daughter of Hyperion by his wife. Pausanias, when describing depictions of Eos's myths at Athens and Amyclae, he calls Eos by the name of Hemera. A scholion on the \"Odyssey\" mentions the abduction of the hunter Orion by \"Hemera\" (Eos in Homer). Eos, in contrast to Helios and Selene and more similarly to Hemera and Hemera's mother Nyx, embodies a part of the day and night cycle, instead of a celestial body. The Greek word \"eos\", meaning dawn, was some times used by writers to refer to the entire duration of the day, not just the morning.\nLikewise, Eos was often referred to as \"Tito\", another archaic word meaning day, and feminine equivalent to \"Titan\", which is a common epithet of her brother Helios denoting his role as the creator of the day. Unlike Eos however, Hemera is little more than a name in Greek literature, with few and far between refences about her and with no unique mythology outside of her parentage and the few stories appropriated from Eos."}

{"id": "10479", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10479", "title": "Elba", "text": "Elba (, ; ) is a Mediterranean island in Tuscany, Italy, from the coastal town of Piombino on the Italian mainland, and the largest island of the Tuscan Archipelago. It is also part of the Arcipelago Toscano National Park, and the third largest island in Italy, after Sicily and Sardinia. It is located in the Tyrrhenian Sea about east of the French island of Corsica.\nThe island is part of the province of Livorno and is divided into seven municipalities, with a total population of about 30,000 inhabitants which increases considerably during the summer. The municipalities are Portoferraio (which is also the island's principal town), Campo nell'Elba, Capoliveri, Marciana, Marciana Marina, Porto Azzurro, and Rio.\nIt is famous for being the site of Napoleon's first exile, from 1814 to 1815.\nGeography.\nElba is the largest remaining stretch of land from the ancient tract that once connected the Italian peninsula to Corsica. The northern coast faces the Ligurian Sea, the eastern coast the Piombino Channel, the southern coast the Tyrrhenian Sea, and the Corsica Channel divides the western tip of the island from neighbouring Corsica.\nGeology.\nThe island itself is made up of slices of rocks which once formed part of the ancient Tethyan seafloor. These rocks have been through at least two orogenies, the Alpine orogeny and the Apennine orogeny. The second of these two events was associated with subduction of the Tethyan oceanic crust underneath Italy and the obduction of parts of the ancient seafloor onto the continents. Later extension within the stretched inner part of the Apennine Mountains caused adiabatic melting and the intrusion of the Mount Capanne and the La Serra-Porto Azzuro granitoids. These igneous bodies brought with them skarn fluids which dissolved and replaced some of the carbonate units, precipitating iron-rich minerals in their place. One of the iron-rich minerals, ilvaite, was first identified on the island and takes its name from the Latin word for Elba. More recently, high-angle faults formed within the tectonic pile, allowing for the migration of iron-rich fluids through the crust. The deposits left behind by these fluids formed the island's rich seams of iron ore.\nThe terrain is quite varied and is thus divided into several areas based on geomorphology. The mountainous and most recent part of the island can be found to the west, the centre of which is dominated by Mount Capanne (at a height of 1,018 metres, or 3,340 feet), also called the \"roof of the Tuscan Archipelago\". The mountain is home to many animal species including the mouflon and wild boar, two species that flourish despite the continuous influx of tourists. The central part of the island is a mostly flat section with the width being reduced to just four kilometres (). It is where the major centres can be found: Portoferraio, Campo nell'Elba. To the east is the oldest part of the island, formed over 3 million years ago. In the hilly area, dominated by Monte Calamita, are the deposits of iron that made Elba famous.\nHydrography.\nRivers rarely exceed in length, and it is common for the shorter ones to dry up during the summer. The largest rivers, sorted by length, are:\nBetween Poggio and Marciana, at the foot of Mount Capanne, is a spring called Fonte Napoleone, known for its quality.\nClimate.\nThe climate of the island is predominantly Mediterranean, except for Mount Capanne, where winters tend to be moderately cold. Precipitation is concentrated in autumn and comprises a normal rainfall. The island lies in the rain shadow of the large and mountainous island of Corsica, so precipitation totals are somewhat reduced from the mainland (most of the island receives less than 750\u00a0mm (30 inches) annually). Snowfall in winter is rare in the lowlands and melts quickly. The table below shows the average temperatures for the islands by month.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe island was originally inhabited by Ligures Ilvates and was called Ilva (\u1f38\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03b1). It was well known from very ancient times for its iron resources and valued mines. The Greeks also called it Aethalia (\u0391\u1f30\u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 or \u0391\u1f30\u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) and Aethale (\u0391\u1f30\u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7) from \"smoky\" (\u03b1\u1f30\u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7), after the fumes of the metal producing furnaces.\nApollonius of Rhodes mentions it in his epic poem \"Argonautica\", describing that the Argonauts rested here during their travels. He writes that signs of their visit were still visible in his day, including skin-coloured pebbles that they dried their hands on and large stones which they used at discus. Strabo (5.2.6) presents a slightly different account: \"because the scrapings, which the Argonauts formed when they used their strigils, became congealed, the pebbles on the shore remain variegated still to this day.\" The port which is now called Porto Ferraio, was known in ancient times as the portus Argous (\u1f08\u03c1\u03b3\u1ff6\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bb\u03b9\u03bc\u03ae\u03bd), because it was believed that the Argonauts landed there on their return voyage.\nThe island was then settled by the Etruscans, who started mining iron at Elba, and later (after 480 BC) by the Romans, who called the island Ilva.\nMiddle Ages and early modern.\nIn the early medieval period, Elba was invaded by the Ostrogoths and the Lombards, and later it became a possession of the Republic of Pisa. After the battle of Meloria, the Republic of Genoa took possession of Elba, but it was regained by Pisa in 1292. The island was retained for two centuries by the Appiani family, Lords of Piombino, when they sold Pisa to the house of Visconti of Milan in 1399.\nIn 1544, the Barbary pirates from North Africa devastated Elba and the coasts of Tuscany. In 1546, part of the island was handed over to Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who fortified Portoferraio and renamed it \"Cosmopoli\", while the rest of the island was returned to the Appiani in 1577. In 1596, Philip II of Spain captured Porto Longone and had two fortresses built there. This part of Elba came into the direct power of Spain through the State of the Presidi, including Porto Longone. In 1736, the sovereignty of this part of Elba was claimed by the Kingdom of Naples but remained abandoned.\nLate modern and contemporary.\nThe British landed on the island of Elba in 1796, after the occupation of Livorno by the French Republican troops, to protect the 4,000 French royalists who had found asylum in Portoferraio two years earlier. In 1801, the Peace of Luneville gave Elba to the Kingdom of Etruria, and it was transferred to France in 1802 by the Peace of Amiens.\nThe French Emperor Napoleon was exiled to Elba, after his forced abdication following the Treaty of Fontainebleau, and conveyed to the island on HMS \"Undaunted\" by Captain Thomas Ussher; he arrived at Portoferraio on 4 May 1814. He was allowed to keep a personal guard of 400 men and was nominally sovereign of Elba, a step down from Emperor of the French. However, the nearby sea was patrolled by the French and British navies to ensure he could not escape. During the months that he stayed on the island, Napoleon carried out a series of economic and social reforms to improve the quality of life. After staying for almost ten months, he managed to escape back to France on 26 February 1815 with about 1,000 men.\nAt the Congress of Vienna, Elba was given to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. In 1860, it became part of the new unified Kingdom of Italy.\nDuring the Second World War, the island was liberated from German occupation by the French \"1er Corps d'Arm\u00e9e\" supported by British forces including Royal Naval Commandos on 17 June 1944, in \"Op\u00e9ration Brassard\". Faulty intelligence and strong defences made the battle more difficult than expected.\nIn 1954, BOAC Flight 781 crashed in the waters off the coast of Elba.\nIn recent decades, thanks to its rich cultural heritage, cuisine and nature, the island has become an important international tourist destination.\nTransportation.\nThe island is connected to the mainland via the four ferry companies, Toremar, Moby Lines, Blunavy and Sardinia Ferries, all offering routes between Piombino and Portoferraio, the capital located in the north, Cavo, Rio Marina and Porto Azzurro, on the east coast of the island.\nThere is an airport on the island, Marina di Campo Airport. It is served by Silver Air with flights to the Italian mainland.\nCycling.\nThe island has a network of trails for road racers looking for more technical routes for their training, trails and dirt roads for bikers to have fun on, and accessible routes for families with children who need safe and relaxing routes. On the road from Rio nell'Elba going to Porto Azzurro is the \"Fonte di Coppi\". Towards the end of his career, Fausto Coppi, the \"campionissimo\", came here to train on the roads of Elba. He still retained a celebrity status but was no longer at the peak of his career that ended with his death a few years later. The plaque on the fountain reads: \"1960\u20132010, here the champion quenched his thirst, after fifty years on the run\".\nSport.\nThe Elba football team represents the island. They were approved as a ConIFA member at the Annual General Meeting 2020. It is not affiliated with FIFA or UEFA, and therefore cannot compete for the FIFA World Cup or in the UEFA European Championship. It is, however, affiliated to ConIFA, and play in the ConIFA European Football Cup.\nElba Island played their first game as a ConIFA member on 11 September 2021 against the Sicily Football Team scoring a 4\u20134 tie against them."}

{"id": "10481", "revid": "48816183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10481", "title": "Enki", "text": "Enki ( ) is the Sumerian god of water, knowledge (\"gest\u00fa\"), crafts (\"ga\u0161am\"), and creation (\"nudimmud\"), and one of the Anunnaki. He was later known as Ea () or Ae in Akkadian (Assyrian-Babylonian) religion, and is identified by some scholars with Ia in Canaanite religion. The name was rendered Aos in Greek sources (e.g. Damascius).\nHe was originally the patron god of the city of Eridu, but later the influence of his cult spread throughout Mesopotamia and to the Canaanites, Hittites and Hurrians. He was associated with the southern band of constellations called \"stars of Ea\", but also with the constellation A\u0160-IKU, \"the Field\" (Square of Pegasus). Beginning around the second millennium BCE, he was sometimes referred to in writing by the numeric ideogram for \"40\", occasionally referred to as his \"sacred number\". The planet Mercury, associated with Babylonian \"Nabu\" (the son of Marduk) was, in Sumerian times, identified with Enki, as was the star Canopus.\nMany myths about Enki have been collected from various sites, stretching from Southern Iraq to the Levantine coast. He is mentioned in the earliest extant cuneiform inscriptions throughout the region and was prominent from the third millennium down to the Hellenistic period.\nEtymology.\nThe exact meaning of Enki's name is uncertain: the common translation is \"Lord of the Earth\". The Sumerian \"En\" is translated as a title equivalent to \"lord\" and was originally a title given to the High Priest. \"Ki\" means \"earth\", but there are theories that \"ki\" in this name has another origin, possibly \"kig\" of unknown meaning, or \"kur\" meaning \"mound\".\nThe name Ea is allegedly Hurrian in origin while others claim that his name 'Ea' is possibly of Semitic origin and may be a derivation from the West-Semitic root *hyy meaning \"life\" in this case used for \"spring\", \"running water\". In Sumerian E-A means \"the house of water\", and it has been suggested that this was originally the name for the shrine to the god at Eridu. \nIt has also been suggested that the original non-anthropomorphic divinity at Eridu was not Enki but Abzu. The emergence of Enki as the divine lover of Ninhursag, and the divine battle between the younger Igigi divinities and Abzu, saw the Abzu, the underground waters of the Aquifer, becoming the place in which the foundations of the temple were built. With some Sumerian deity names as Enlil there are variations like Elil. En means \"Lord\" and E means \"temple\". It is likely that E-A is the Sumerian short form for \"Lord of Water\", as Enki is a god of water. Ab in Abzu also means \"water\".\nWorship.\nThe main temple to Enki was called \"E-abzu\", meaning \"abzu temple\" (also \"E-en-gur-a\", meaning \"house of the subterranean waters\"), a ziggurat temple surrounded by Euphratean marshlands near the ancient Persian Gulf coastline at Eridu. It was the first temple known to have been built in Southern Iraq. Four separate excavations at the site of Eridu have demonstrated the existence of a shrine dating back to the earliest Ubaid period, more than 6,500 years ago. Over the following 4,500 years, the temple was expanded 18 times, until it was abandoned during the Persian period. On this basis Thorkild Jacobsen has hypothesized that the original deity of the temple was Abzu, with his attributes later being taken by Enki over time. P. Steinkeller believes that, during the earliest period, Enki had a subordinate position to a goddess (possibly Ninhursag), taking the role of divine consort or high priest, later taking priority. The Enki temple had at its entrance a pool of fresh water, and excavation has found numerous carp bones, suggesting collective feasts. Carp are shown in the twin water flows running into the later God Enki, suggesting continuity of these features over a very long period. These features were found at all subsequent Sumerian temples, suggesting that this temple established the pattern for all subsequent Sumerian temples. \"All rules laid down at Eridu were faithfully observed\".\nIconography.\nEnki was the keeper of the divine powers called \"Me\", the gifts of civilization. He is often shown with the horned crown of divinity.\nOn the Adda Seal, Enki is depicted with two streams of water flowing into each of his shoulders: one the Tigris, the other the Euphrates. Alongside him are two trees, symbolizing the male and female aspects of nature. He is shown wearing a flounced skirt and a cone-shaped hat. An eagle descends from above to land upon his outstretched right arm. This portrayal reflects Enki's role as the god of water, life, and replenishment.\nConsidered the master shaper of the world, god of wisdom and of all magic, Enki was characterized as the lord of the Abzu (Apsu in Akkadian), the freshwater sea or groundwater located within the earth. In the later Babylonian epic \"En\u00fbma Eli\u0161\", Abzu, the \"begetter of the gods\", is inert and sleepy but finds his peace disturbed by the younger gods, so sets out to destroy them. His grandson Enki, chosen to represent the younger gods, puts a spell on Abzu \"casting him into a deep sleep\", thereby confining him deep underground. Enki subsequently sets up his home \"\"in the depths of the Abzu\".\" Enki thus takes on all of the functions of the Abzu, including his fertilising powers as lord of the waters and lord of semen.\nEarly royal inscriptions from the third millennium BCE mention \"the reeds of Enki\". Reeds were an important local building material, used for baskets and containers, and collected outside the city walls, where the dead or sick were often carried. This links Enki to the \"Kur\" or underworld of Sumerian mythology. In another even older tradition, Nammu, the goddess of the primeval creative matter and the mother-goddess portrayed as having \"given birth to the great gods,\" was the mother of Enki, and as the watery creative force, was said to preexist Ea-Enki. Benito states \"With Enki it is an interesting change of gender symbolism, the fertilising agent is also water, Sumerian \"a\" or \"Ab\" which also means \"semen\". In one evocative passage in a Sumerian hymn, Enki stands at the empty riverbeds and fills them with his 'water'\".\nMythology.\nCreation of life and sickness.\nThe cosmogenic myth common in Sumer was that of the hieros gamos, a sacred marriage where divine principles in the form of dualistic opposites came together as male and female to give birth to the cosmos. In the epic \"Enki and Ninhursag\", Enki, as lord of \"Ab\" or fresh water, is living with his wife in the paradise of Dilmun where\nDespite being a place where \"the raven uttered no cries\" and \"the lion killed not, the wolf snatched not the lamb, unknown was the kid-killing dog, unknown was the grain devouring boar\", Dilmun had no water and Enki heard the cries of its goddess, Ninsikil, and orders the sun-god Utu to bring fresh water from the Earth for Dilmun. As a result,\nDilmun was identified with Bahrain, whose name in Arabic means \"two seas\", where the fresh waters of the Arabian aquifer mingle with the salt waters of the Persian Gulf. This mingling of waters was known in Sumerian as Nammu, and was identified as the mother of Enki.\nThe subsequent tale, with similarities to the Biblical story of the forbidden fruit, repeats the story of how fresh water brings life to a barren land. Enki, the Water-Lord then \"caused to flow the 'water of the heart\" and having fertilised his consort Ninhursag, also known as Ki or Earth, after \"Nine days being her nine months, the months of 'womanhood'... like good butter, Nintu, the mother of the land, ...like good butter, gave birth to Ninsar, (Lady Greenery)\". When Ninhursag left him, as Water-Lord he came upon Ninsar (Lady Greenery). Not knowing her to be his daughter, and because she reminds him of his absent consort, Enki then seduces and has intercourse with her. Ninsar then gave birth to Ninkurra (Lady Fruitfulness or Lady Pasture), and leaves Enki alone again. A second time, Enki, in his loneliness finds and seduces Ninkurra, and from the union Ninkurra gave birth to Uttu (weaver or spider, the weaver of the web of life).\nA third time Enki succumbs to temptation, and attempts seduction of Uttu. Upset about Enki's reputation, Uttu consults Ninhursag, who, upset at the promiscuous wayward nature of her spouse, advises Uttu to avoid the riverbanks, the places likely to be affected by flooding, the home of Enki. In another version of this myth, Ninhursag takes Enki's semen from Uttu's womb and plants it in the earth where eight plants rapidly germinate. With his two-faced servant and steward Isimud, \"Enki, in the swampland, in the swampland lies stretched out, 'What is this (plant), what is this (plant).' His messenger Isimud, answers him; 'My king, this is the tree-plant', he says to him. He cuts it off for him and he (Enki) eats it\". And so, despite warnings, Enki consumes the other seven fruit. Consuming his own semen, he falls pregnant (ill with swellings) in his jaw, his teeth, his mouth, his hip, his throat, his limbs, his side and his rib. The gods are at a loss to know what to do; chagrined they \"sit in the dust\". As Enki lacks a birth canal through which to give birth, he seems to be dying with swellings. The fox then asks Enlil, King of the Gods, \"If I bring Ninhursag before thee, what shall be my reward?\" Ninhursag's sacred fox then fetches the goddess.\nNinhursag relents and takes Enki's Ab (water, or semen) into her body, and gives birth to gods of healing of each part of the body: Abu for the jaw, Nanshe for the throat, Nintul for the hip, Ninsutu for the tooth, Ninkasi for the mouth, Dazimua for the side, Enshagag for the limbs. The last one, Ninti (Lady Rib), is also a pun on Lady Life, a title of Ninhursag herself. The story thus symbolically reflects the way in which life is brought forth through the addition of water to the land, and once it grows, water is required to bring plants to fruit. It also counsels balance and responsibility, nothing to excess.\nNinti, the title of Ninhursag, also means \"the mother of all living\", and was a title later given to the Hurrian goddess Kheba. This is also the title given in the Bible to Eve, the Hebrew and Aramaic \"\u1e24awwah\" (\u05d7\u05d5\u05d4), who was made from the rib of Adam, in a strange reflection of the Sumerian myth, in which Adam \u2013 not Enki \u2013 walks in the Garden of Paradise.\nMaking of man.\nAfter six generations of gods, in the Babylonian \"En\u00fbma Eli\u0161\", in the seventh generation, (Akkadian \"shapattu\" or sabath), the younger Igigi gods, the sons and daughters of Enlil and Ninlil, go on strike and refuse their duties of keeping creation working. Abzu, god of fresh water, co-creator of the cosmos, threatens to destroy the world with his waters, and the gods gather in terror. Enki promises to help and puts Abzu to sleep, confining him in irrigation canals and places him in the Kur, beneath his city of Eridu. But the universe is still threatened, as Tiamat, angry at the imprisonment of Abzu and at the prompting of her son and vizier Kingu, decides to take back creation herself. The gods gather again in terror and turn to Enki for help, but Enki \u2013 who harnessed Abzu, Tiamat's consort, for irrigation \u2013 refuses to get involved. The gods then seek help elsewhere, and the patriarchal Enlil, their father, god of Nippur, promises to solve the problem if they make him King of the Gods. In the Babylonian tale, Enlil's role is taken by Marduk, Enki's son, and in the Assyrian version it is Ashur. After dispatching Tiamat with the \"arrows of his winds\" down her throat and constructing the heavens with the arch of her ribs, Enlil places her tail in the sky as the Milky Way, and her crying eyes become the source of the Tigris and Euphrates. But there is still the problem of \"who will keep the cosmos working\". Enki, who might have otherwise come to their aid, is lying in a deep sleep and fails to hear their cries. His mother Nammu (creatrix also of Abzu and Tiamat) \"brings the tears of the gods\" before Enki and says\nEnki then advises that they create a servant of the gods, humankind, out of clay and blood. Against Enki's wish, the gods decide to slay Kingu, and Enki finally consents to use Kingu's blood to make the first human, with whom Enki always later has a close relationship, the first of the seven sages, seven wise men or \"Abgallu\" (\"ab\" = water, \"gal\" = great, \"lu\" = man), also known as Adapa. Enki assembles a team of divinities to help him, creating a host of \"good and princely fashioners\". He tells his mother:\nAdapa, the first man fashioned, later goes and acts as the advisor to the King of Eridu, when in the Sumerian King-List, the \"me\" of \"kingship descends on Eridu\".\nSamuel Noah Kramer believes that behind this myth of Enki's confinement of Abzu lies an older one of the struggle between Enki and the Dragon Kur (the underworld).\nThe Atrahasis-Epos has it that Enlil requested from Nammu the creation of humans. And Nammu told him that with the help of Enki (her son) she can create humans in the image of gods.\nUniter of languages.\nIn the Sumerian epic entitled \"Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta\", in a speech of Enmerkar, an introductory spell appears, recounting Enki having had mankind communicate in one language (following Jay Crisostomo 2019); or, in other accounts, it is a hymn imploring Enki to do so. \nIn either case, Enki \"facilitated the debates between [the two kings] by allowing the world to speak one language,\" the presumed superior language of the tablet, i.e. Sumerian.\nJay Crisostomo's 2019 translation, based on the recent work of C. Mittermayer is:\nS.N. Kramer's 1940 translation is as follows:\nThe deluge.\nIn the Sumerian version of the flood myth, the causes of the flood and the reasons for the hero's survival are unknown due to the fact that the beginning of the tablet describing the story has been destroyed. Nonetheless, Kramer has stated that it can probably be reasonably inferred that the hero Ziusudra survives due to Enki's aid because that is what happens in the later Akkadian and Babylonian versions of the story.\nIn the later Legend of Atrahasis, Enlil, the King of the Gods, sets out to eliminate humanity, whose noise is disturbing his rest. He successively sends drought, famine and plague to eliminate humanity, but Enki thwarts his half-brother's plans by teaching Atrahasis how to counter these threats. Each time, Atrahasis asks the population to abandon worship of all gods except the one responsible for the calamity, and this seems to shame them into relenting. Humans, however, proliferate a fourth time. Enraged, Enlil convenes a Council of Deities and gets them to promise not to tell humankind that he plans their total annihilation. Enki does not tell Atrahasis directly, but speaks to him in secret via a reed wall. He instructs Atrahasis to build a boat in order to rescue his family and other living creatures from the coming deluge. After the seven-day deluge, the flood hero frees a swallow, a raven and a dove in an effort to find if the flood waters have receded. Upon landing, a sacrifice is made to the gods. Enlil is angry his will has been thwarted yet again, and Enki is named as the culprit. Enki explains that Enlil is unfair to punish the guiltless, and the gods institute measures to ensure that humanity does not become too populous in the future. This is one of the oldest of the surviving Middle Eastern deluge myths.\nEnki and Inanna.\nThe myth \"Enki and Inanna\" tells the story of how the young goddess of the \u00c9-anna temple of Uruk feasts with her father Enki. The two deities participate in a drinking competition; then, Enki, thoroughly inebriated, gives Inanna all of the \"mes\". The next morning, when Enki awakes with a hangover, he asks his servant Isimud for the \"mes\", only to be informed that he has given them to Inanna. Upset, he sends \"Galla\" to recover them. Inanna sails away in the boat of heaven and arrives safely back at the quay of Uruk. Eventually, Enki admits his defeat and accepts a peace treaty with Uruk.\nPolitically, this myth would seem to indicate events of an early period when political authority passed from Enki's city of Eridu to Inanna's city of Uruk.\nIn the myth of \"Inanna's Descent\", Inanna, in order to console her grieving sister Ereshkigal, who is mourning the death of her husband Gugalana (\"gu\" 'bull', \"gal\" 'big', \"ana\" 'sky/heaven'), slain by Gilgamesh and Enkidu, sets out to visit her sister. Inanna tells her servant Ninshubur ('Lady Evening', a reference to Inanna's role as the evening star) to get help from Anu, Enlil or Enki if she does not return in three days. After Inanna has not come back, Ninshubur approaches Anu, only to be told that he knows the goddess's strength and her ability to take care of herself. While Enlil tells Ninshubur he is busy running the cosmos, Enki immediately expresses concern and dispatches his Galla (Galaturra or Kurgarra, sexless beings created from the dirt from beneath the god's finger-nails) to recover the young goddess.\nThese beings may be the origin of the Greco-Roman \"Galli\", androgynous beings of the third sex who played an important part in early religious ritual.\nIn the story \"Inanna and Shukaletuda\", Shukaletuda, the gardener, set by Enki to care for the date palm he had created, finds Inanna sleeping under the palm tree and rapes the goddess in her sleep. Awaking, she discovers that she has been violated and seeks to punish the miscreant. Shukaletuda seeks protection from Enki, whom Bott\u00e9ro believes to be his father. In classic Enkian fashion, the father advises Shukaletuda to hide in the city where Inanna will not be able to find him. Enki, as the protector of whoever comes to seek his help, and as the empowerer of Inanna, here challenges the young impetuous goddess to control her anger so as to be better able to function as a great judge.\nEventually, after cooling her anger, she too seeks the help of Enki, as spokesperson of the \"assembly of the gods\", the Igigi and the Anunnaki. After she presents her case, Enki sees that justice needs to be done and promises help, delivering knowledge of where the miscreant is hiding.\nInfluence.\nEnki and later Ea were apparently depicted, sometimes, as a man covered with the skin of a fish, and this representation, as likewise the name of his temple E-apsu, \"house of the watery deep\", points decidedly to his original character as a god of the waters (see Oannes). Around the excavation of the 18 shrines found on the spot, thousands of carp bones were found, consumed possibly in feasts to the god. Of his cult at Eridu, which goes back to the oldest period of Mesopotamian history, nothing definite is known except that his temple was also associated with Ninhursag's temple which was called \"Esaggila\", \"the lofty head house\" (\"E\", house, \"sag\", head, \"ila\", high; or Akkadian goddess = Ila), a name shared with Marduk's temple in Babylon, pointing to a staged tower or ziggurat (as with the temple of Enlil at Nippur, which was known as \"E-kur\" (\"kur\", hill)), and that incantations, involving ceremonial rites in which water as a sacred element played a prominent part, formed a feature of his worship. This seems also implicated in the epic of the hieros gamos or sacred marriage of Enki and Ninhursag (above), which seems an etiological myth of the fertilisation of the dry ground by the coming of irrigation water (from Sumerian \"a\", \"ab\", water or semen). The early inscriptions of Urukagina in fact go so far as to suggest that the divine pair, Enki and Ninki, were the progenitors of seven pairs of gods, including Enki as god of Eridu, Enlil of Nippur, and Su'en (or Sin) of Ur, and were themselves the children of An (sky, heaven) and Ki (earth). The pool of the Abzu at the front of his temple was adopted also at the temple to Nanna (Akkadian Sin) the Moon, at Ur, and spread from there throughout the Middle East. It is believed to remain today as the sacred pool at Mosques, or as the holy water font in Catholic or Eastern Orthodox churches.\nWhether Eridu at one time also played an important political role in Sumerian affairs is not certain, though not improbable. At all events the prominence of \"Ea\" led, as in the case of Nippur, to the survival of Eridu as a sacred city, long after it had ceased to have any significance as a political center. Myths in which Ea figures prominently have been found in Assurbanipal's library, and in the Hattusas archive in Hittite Anatolia. As Ea, Enki had a wide influence outside of Sumer, being equated with El (at Ugarit) and possibly Yah (at Ebla) in the Canaanite 'ilhm pantheon. He is also found in Hurrian and Hittite mythology as a god of contracts, and is particularly favourable to humankind. It has been suggested that etymologically the name Ea comes from the term \"*hyy\" (life), referring to Enki's waters as life-giving. Enki/Ea is essentially a god of civilization, wisdom, and culture. He was also the creator and protector of man, and of the world in general. Traces of this version of Ea appear in the Marduk epic celebrating the achievements of this god and the close connection between the Ea cult at Eridu and that of Marduk. The correlation between the two rises from two other important connections: (1) that the name of Marduk's sanctuary at Babylon bears the same name, \"Esaggila\", as that of a temple in Eridu, and (2) that Marduk is generally termed the son of Ea, who derives his powers from the voluntary abdication of the father in favour of his son. Accordingly, the incantations originally composed for the Ea cult were re-edited by the priests of Babylon and adapted to the worship of Marduk, and, similarly, the hymns to Marduk betray traces of the transfer to Marduk of attributes which originally belonged to Ea.\nIt is, however, as the third figure in the triad (the two other members of which were Anu and Enlil) that Ea acquires his permanent place in the pantheon. To him was assigned the control of the watery element, and in this capacity he becomes the \"shar apsi\"; i.e. king of the Apsu or \"the abyss\". The Apsu was figured as the abyss of water beneath the earth, and since the gathering place of the dead, known as Aralu, was situated near the confines of the Apsu, he was also designated as En -Ki; i.e. \"lord of that which is below\", in contrast to Anu, who was the lord of the \"above\" or the heavens. The cult of Ea extended throughout Babylonia and Assyria. We find temples and shrines erected in his honour, e.g. at Nippur, Girsu, Ur, Babylon, Sippar, and Nineveh, and the numerous epithets given to him, as well as the various forms under which the god appears, alike bear witness to the popularity which he enjoyed from the earliest to the latest period of Babylonian-Assyrian history. The consort of Ea, known as Ninhursag, Ki, Uriash Damkina, \"lady of that which is below\", or Damgalnunna, \"big lady of the waters\", originally was fully equal with Ea, but in more patriarchal Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian times plays a part merely in association with her lord. Generally, however, Enki seems to be a reflection of pre-patriarchal times, in which relations between the sexes were characterised by a situation of greater gender equality. In his character, he prefers persuasion to conflict, which he seeks to avoid if possible.\nEa and West Semitic deities.\nIn 1964, a team of Italian archaeologists under the direction of Paolo Matthiae of the University of Rome La Sapienza performed a series of excavations of material from the third-millennium BCE city of Ebla. Much of the written material found in these digs was later translated by Giovanni Pettinato. Among other conclusions, he found a tendency among the inhabitants of Ebla, after the reign of Sargon of Akkad, to replace the name of El, king of the gods of the Canaanite pantheon (found in names such as Mikael and Ishmael), with \"Ia\" (Mikaia, Ishmaia).\nJean Bott\u00e9ro (1952) and others suggested that \"Ia\" in this case is a West Semitic (Canaanite) way of pronouncing the Akkadian name \"Ea\". Scholars largely reject the theory identifying this \"Ia\" with the Israelite theonym \"YHWH\", while explaining how it might have been misinterpreted. \"Ia\" has also been compared by William Hallo with the Ugaritic god \"Yamm\" (\"Sea\"), (also called Judge Nahar, or Judge River) whose earlier name in at least one ancient source was \"Yaw\" or \"Ya'a\".\nEa was also known as \"Dagon\" and \"Uanna\" (Grecised \"Oannes\"), the first of the Seven Sages."}

Known for his character actor roles, his entertainment career spanned over six decades. He received a BAFTA Award, a Tony Award, and an Primetime Emmy Award. He also was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1988 and received the Academy Honorary Award in 2010.\nOriginally trained in stage acting, he garnered over 90 film credits. He and his wife Anne Jackson often appeared together on stage, eventually becoming a notable acting couple in American theater. Wallach initially studied method acting under Sanford Meisner and later became a founding member of the Actors Studio, where he studied under Lee Strasberg. He played a wide variety of roles throughout his career, primarily as a supporting actor. He won the Tony Award for Best Supporting or Featured Actor in a Play for \"The Rose Tattoo\" (1951).\nFor his debut screen performance in \"Baby Doll\" (1956), he won a BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer and a Golden Globe Award nomination. Among his other most famous roles are Calvera in \"The Magnificent Seven\" (1960), Guido in \"The Misfits\" (1961), and Tuco (\"The Ugly\") in \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" (1966) and Don Altobello in \"The Godfather Part III\" (1990). Other notable films include \"How the West Was Won\" (1962), \"Tough Guys\" (1986), \"The Two Jakes\" (1990), \"The Associate\" (1996), \"The Holiday\" (2006), \"\", and \"The Ghost Writer\" (both 2010). He received Primetime Emmy Award nominations for \"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip\" (2007) and \"Nurse Jackie\" (2011).\nEarly life and education.\nEli Herschel Wallach was born on December 7, 1915, at 156 Union Street in Red Hook, Brooklyn, a son of Polish Jewish immigrants Abraham and Bertha (Schorr) Wallach from Przemy\u015bl. He had a brother and two sisters. He and his family were among only a few Jews in an otherwise Italian American neighborhood. His parents owned Bertha's Candy Store. Wallach graduated in 1936 from the University of Texas with a degree in history. In a later interview, Wallach said that he learned to ride horses while in Texas, explaining that he liked Texas because \"It opened my eyes to the word \"friendship...\" You could rely on people. If they gave you their word, that was it\u00a0... It was an education.\"\nTwo years later he earned a master of arts degree in education from the City College of New York. He gained his first method acting experience at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City, where he studied under Sanford Meisner. There, according to Wallach, actors were forced to \"unlearn\" all their physical and vocal mannerisms, while traditional stage etiquette and \"singsong\" deliveries were \"utterly excised\" from his classroom.\nMilitary service.\nWallach's education was cut short when he was drafted into the United States Army in 1940. He served as a staff sergeant and medic in a military hospital in Hawaii and later was sent to Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Abilene, Texas, to train as a medical administrative officer. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, he was ordered to Casablanca. Later, when he was serving in France, a senior officer noticed his acting career and asked him to create a show for the patients. He and his unit wrote a play called \"Is This the Army?\", which was inspired by Irving Berlin's \"This Is the Army\". In the comedy, Wallach and the other actors mocked Axis dictators, with Wallach portraying Adolf Hitler. Wallach was discharged as a captain following the war's end in 1945. He was awarded the Army Good Conduct Medal, the American Defense Service Medal, the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic\u2013Pacific Campaign Medal, the European\u2013African\u2013Middle Eastern Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal.\nCareer.\nStage actor.\nWallach took classes in acting at the Dramatic Workshop of the New School in New York City with the influential German director Erwin Piscator. He later became a founding member of the Actors Studio, taught by Lee Strasberg. There, he studied more method acting technique with founding member Robert Lewis, and with other students including Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, Herbert Berghof, Sidney Lumet, and his soon-to-be wife, Anne Jackson. Wallach became Marilyn Monroe's first new friend when she became a student at the Actors Studio, once insisting on watching him perform in \"The Teahouse of the August Moon\" from the backstage wings, simply to see up close how experienced actors perform a two-hour play. She also became friends with his wife, Anne Jackson, also studying at the Studio, and would visit the couple at their home and sometimes babysit their new child.\nIn 1945 Wallach made his Broadway debut and he won a Tony Award in 1951 for his performance alongside Maureen Stapleton in the Tennessee Williams play \"The Rose Tattoo\". His other theater credits include \"Mister Roberts\", \"The Teahouse of the August Moon\", \"Camino Real\", \"Major Barbara\" (in which director Charles Laughton discouraged Wallach's established method acting style), \"Luv\", and \"Staircase\", co-starring Milo O'Shea, which was a serious depiction of an aging homosexual couple. He also played a role in a tour of \"Antony and Cleopatra,\" produced by the actress Katharine Cornell in 1946. He exposed Americans to the work of playwright Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco in plays including \"The Chairs\" and \"The Lesson\" in 1958, and in 1961 \"Rhinoceros\" opposite Zero Mostel. He last starred on stage as the title character in \"Visiting Mr. Green\".\nThe stage was where Wallach focused his early career. From 1945 to 1950 he and his wife, Anne Jackson, worked together acting in various plays by Tennessee Williams. The five years following, he continued only working on stage, not becoming involved in film work until 1956. During those years, however, they were generally having a hard time making ends meet. He recalls they were getting along on unemployment insurance and living in a one-room, $35 a month apartment on lower Fifth Avenue in the Village. When he did get offered early movie parts, he turned them down with no regrets, and very early in his career he explained his reasoning:\nHe said that the stage was what attracted him most and what he \"needed\" to do. \"Acting is the most alive thing I can do, and the most joyous\", he stated.\nWallach and Jackson became one of the best-known acting couples in the American theater, as iconic as Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, and Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn, and they looked for opportunities to work together. During an interview, he said of Jackson, \"I have tremendous respect and admiration for her as an actress . . . we have a terrific working compatibility when we're in the same play, especially when the play means something important to us.\" When he did gravitate toward accepting parts in films, he did so to \"help pay the bills\", he said, adding, \"for actors, movies are a means to an end.\"\nDespite the fact that he eventually acted in over 90 films and almost as many television dramas, he continued to accept stage parts throughout his career, often with Jackson. They played in comedies like \"The Typists\" and \"The Tiger\" in 1963, and acted together in \"Waltz of the Toreadors\" in 1973. In 1978 they played in a revival of \"The Diary of Anne Frank\", along with their daughters, and in 1984 they acted in \"Nest of the Wood Grouse,\" directed by Joseph Papp. Four years later, in 1988, they acted in a revival of \"Cafe Crown\", a portrait of the Yiddish theater scene during its prime. They continued acting together as late as 2000, while he also took on roles alone throughout all those years.\nFilm and television roles.\nWallach's film debut was in Elia Kazan's controversial 1956 \"Baby Doll\", for which he won the British Academy Film Awards (BAFTA) as \"Most Promising Newcomer.\" \"Baby Doll\" was controversial because of its underlying sexual theme. Director Elia Kazan however, set explicit limits on Wallach's scenes, telling him not to actually seduce Carroll Baker, but instead to create an unfulfilled erotic tension. Kazan later explained his reasoning:\nWallach went on to a prolific career as \"one of the greatest 'character actors' ever to appear on stage and screen\", notes Turner Classic Movies, acting in over 90 films. Having grown up on the \"mean streets\" of an Italian American neighborhood, and his versatility as a method actor, Wallach developed the ability to play a wide variety of different roles, although he tried to not get pinned down to any single type of character. \"Right now I'm playing an old man\", he said at age 84. But \"I've been through all the ethnic groups, from Mexican bandits to Italian Mafia heads to Okinawans to half-breeds, and now I'm playing old Jews. Who knows?\"\nNoting this versatility as a character actor, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences called him \"the quintessential chameleon\", with the ability to play different characters \"effortlessly\", and \"L.A. Times\" theater critic Charles McNulty saw Wallach's \"power to illuminate\" his various screen or stage personas as being \"radioactive.\" \"The Guardian\" has written that \"Wallach was made for character acting\", and includes movie clips from some of his most memorable roles in a tribute to him.\nIn 1961, Wallach co-starred with Marilyn Monroe, Montgomery Clift and Clark Gable in \"The Misfits\", Monroe's and Gable's last film before their deaths. Wallach never learned why he was cast in the film, although he suspected that Monroe had something to do with it. Its screenwriter, Arthur Miller, who was married to Monroe at the time, said that \"Eli Wallach is the happiest good actor I've ever known. He really enjoys the work.\"\nSome of his other films included \"The Lineup\" (1958); \"Lord Jim\" (1965) with Peter O'Toole; a comic role in \"How to Steal a Million\" (1966), again with O'Toole, and Audrey Hepburn; and as Tuco (\"the Ugly\") in Sergio Leone's \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" (1966) with Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef, followed by other Spaghetti Westerns, such as \"Ace High\". At one point, Henry Fonda had asked Wallach whether he himself should accept a part offered to him to act in a similar Western, \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (1968), which would also be directed by Leone. Wallach said \"Yes, you'll enjoy the challenge\", and Fonda later thanked Wallach for that advice.\nWallach and Eastwood became friends during the filming of \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" and he recalled their off-work time together: \"Clint was the tall, silent type. He's the kind where you open up and do all the talking. He smiles and nods and stores it all away in that wonderful calculator of a brain.\" In 2003 Wallach acted in \"Mystic River\", produced and directed by Eastwood, who once said \"working with Eli Wallach has been one of the great pleasures of my life.\"\nA pivotal moment in Wallach's career came in 1953, when he, along with Frank Sinatra and Harvey Lembeck, tried out for the role of Maggio in the film \"From Here to Eternity\". Sinatra biographer Kitty Kelly notes that while Sinatra's test was good, it had none of the \"consummate acting ability\" of Wallach. Producer Harry Cohn and director Fred Zinnemann were \"dazzled\" by Wallach's screen test and wanted him to play the part. However, Wallach had previously been offered an important role in another Tennessee Williams play, \"Camino Real\", to be directed by Elia Kazan, and turned down the movie role. Wallach said that when he learned that the play had finally received financing, he \"grabbed\" the opportunity: \"It was a remarkable piece of writing by the leading playwright in America and it was going to be directed by the country's best. There really wasn't much of a choice for me.\" The film, however, went on to win eight Academy Awards, including one for Sinatra, which revived his career. Wallach recalled afterwards, \"Whenever Sinatra saw me, he'd say, 'Hello, you crazy actor!'\" Wallach, however, said he had no regrets.\nFilm historian James Welsh states that during Wallach's career, he appeared in most of the \"prestige\" television dramas during the \"Golden Age\" of the 1950s, including \"Studio One\", \"The Philco Television Playhouse\", \"The Armstrong Circle Theatre\", \"Playhouse 90\", and \"The Hallmark Hall of Fame\", among others. He won the 1966\u20131967 Emmy Award for his role in the telefilm \"The Poppy is Also a Flower\". In 2006 Wallach appeared on NBC's \"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip\", playing a former writer who was blacklisted in the 1950s. His character was a writer on \"The Philco Comedy Hour\", a show that aired on a fictional NBS network. This is a reference to \"The Philco Television Playhouse\", in several episodes of which Wallach actually appeared in 1955. Wallach earned a 2007 Emmy nomination for his work on the show.\nDuring the filming of \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\", Wallach nearly died three times. Once, he accidentally drank a bottle of acid which was placed next to his pop bottle; another time was in a scene where he was about to be hanged, someone fired a pistol which caused the horse underneath him to bolt and run while Wallach's hands were still tied behind his back; in a different scene with him lying on a railroad track, he was close to being decapitated by steps jutting out from the train.\nWallach appeared as DC Comics' supervillain Mr. Freeze in the 1960s \"Batman\" television series. He said that he received more fan mail about his role as Mr. Freeze than for all his other roles combined. He played Gus Farber in the television miniseries \"Seventh Avenue\" in 1977, and 10 years later, at the age of 71, he starred alongside Michael Landon in \"Highway to Heaven\" episode \"A Father's Faith\". Three years later, he played aging mob boss Don Altobello in Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather Part III\".\nOn November 13, 2010, at the age of 94, Wallach received an Academy Honorary Award for his contribution to the film industry from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. A few years prior to that event, Kate Winslet told another audience that Wallach, with whom she acted in \"The Holiday\" in 2006, was one of the \"most charismatic men\" she'd met, and her \"very own sexiest man alive.\"\nWallach's final performance was in the short film \"The Train\" (2015). Wallach plays a Holocaust survivor who, in a meeting, teaches a self-consumed and preoccupied young man that life can change in a moment. The short was shot in early 2014 and premiered on August 6, 2015, at the Rhode Island International Film Festival.\nBetween 1984 and 1997, he also performed voiceovers in a series of television commercials for the Toyota Pickup.\nPersonal life.\nWallach was married to actress Anne Jackson, with whom he frequently shared the screen, from March 5, 1948, until his death on June 24, 2014. They had three children: Peter, Katherine, and Roberta.\nA few years before 2005, Wallach lost sight in his left eye as the result of a stroke.\nHis niece is historian Joan Wallach Scott (daughter of his brother Sam). A. O. Scott, a film critic for \"The New York Times\", is his great-nephew.\nWallach's grandson is Tracy Wallach, bass player for Arizona metal band Icon. \nDeath.\nWallach died on June 24, 2014, of natural causes at the age of 98. His body was cremated.\nKatherine Wallach told \"The New York Times\" that Anne Jackson died on April 12, 2016, aged 90, at her home in Manhattan.\nFilmography.\nSelected filmography: "}
{"id": "10484", "revid": "4788526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10484", "title": "Electric Light Orchestra", "text": "The Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) are an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1970 by multi-instrumentalists Jeff Lynne and Roy Wood and drummer Bev Bevan. Their music is characterised by a fusion of pop and classical arrangements with futuristic iconography. After Wood's departure in 1972, Lynne became the band's sole leader, arranging and producing every album while writing nearly all of their original material. During their first run from 1970 to 1986, Lynne and Bevan were the group's only consistent members.\nThe group's name is a pun that references both electric light and \"light orchestral music\", a popular style featured in places such as the BBC Light Programme between the 1940s and 1960s. ELO was formed out of Lynne's and Wood's desire to create modern rock and pop songs with classical influences. It derived as an offshoot of Wood's previous band, the Move, of which Lynne and Bevan were also members. During the 1970s and 1980s, ELO released a string of top 10 albums and singles, including the band's most commercially successful album, the double album \"Out of the Blue\" (1977). Two ELO albums reached the top of the British charts: the disco-inspired \"Discovery\" (1979) and the science-fiction-themed concept album \"Time\" (1981). \nIn 1986, Lynne lost interest in the band and disbanded the group. Bevan responded by forming his own band, ELO Part II, which later became The Orchestra. Following a brief reunion from 2000 to 2001, ELO once again went inactive until 2014, when Lynne re-formed the band with Richard Tandy as Jeff Lynne's ELO. Tandy died in May 2024, leaving Lynne as the sole living member. In 2024 ELO embarked on their final tour, which had been announced 4 years prior to Tandy's death, but was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring ELO's original 13-year period of active recording and touring, they sold over 50 million records worldwide. They collected 19 CRIA, 21 RIAA, and 38 BPI awards. From 1972 to 1986 ELO accumulated 27 Top 40 songs on the UK Singles Chart, and fifteen Top 20 songs on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The band also holds the record for having the most \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Top 40 hits (20) without a number one. In 2017, four key members of ELO (Wood, Lynne, Bevan, and Tandy) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nHistory.\n1970\u20131973: Formation and early albums.\nIn 1968, Roy Wood\u2014guitarist, vocalist and songwriter of the Move\u2014had an idea to form a new band that would use violins, cellos, string basses, horns and woodwinds to give their music a classical sound, allowing rock music to \"pick up where the Beatles left off\" in a new direction. The orchestral instruments would be the main focus, rather than the guitars. Jeff Lynne, frontman of fellow Birmingham group The Idle Race, was excited by the concept. When Trevor Burton left the Move in February 1969, Lynne was asked by Wood to join, only to say no, as he was still focused on finding success with his band. But in January 1970, when Carl Wayne quit the band, Lynne accepted Wood's second invitation to join, on the condition that they focus their energy on the new project.\nOn 12 July 1970, when Wood added multiple cellos to a Lynne-penned song intended to be a Move B-side, the new concept became a reality and \"10538 Overture\" became the first Electric Light Orchestra song. The original plan was to end The Move following the release of the \"Looking On\" album at the end of 1970, crossing over to the new unit in the new year. But to help finance the fledgling band, one further Move album, \"Message from the Country\", was recorded during the lengthy ELO recordings and released in mid-1971. The resulting debut album \"The Electric Light Orchestra\" was released in December 1971. Only the trio of Wood, Lynne and Bevan played on all songs, with Bill Hunt supplying the French Horn parts and Steve Woolam playing violin. It was released in the United States in March 1972 as \"No Answer\". The name was chosen after a U.S. record company secretary had tried to ring the UK company to get the name of the album. They were unavailable so she left a note reading \"No answer\". \"10538 Overture\" became a UK top-ten hit. With both bands' albums in the stores simultaneously, the Move and ELO both appeared on television during this period.\nELO's debut concert took place on 16 April 1972 at the Greyhound Pub in Croydon, Surrey, with a line-up of Wood, Lynne, Bevan, Bill Hunt (keyboards/French horn), Andy Craig (cello), Mike Edwards (cello), Wilfred Gibson (violin), Hugh McDowell (cello), and Richard Tandy (bass). However, this line-up did not last for long. First Craig departed, and then Wood, during the recordings for the band's second LP. Taking Hunt and McDowell with him, Wood left the band to form Wizzard. Both cited problems with their manager, Don Arden, who Wood felt failed in his role, and an unsatisfactory tour of Italy. However, Arden would manage Wizzard, despite Wood's negative comments towards Arden. Despite predictions from the music press that the band would fold without Wood, who had been the driving force behind the creation of ELO, Lynne stepped up to lead the band, with Bevan, Edwards, Gibson and Tandy (who had switched from bass to keyboards to replace Hunt) remaining from the previous line-up, and new recruits Mike de Albuquerque and Colin Walker joining the band on bass and cello, respectively.\nThe new line-up performed at the 1972 Reading Festival on 12 August 1972. Barcus Berry instrument pick-ups, now sported by the band's string trio, allowed them to have proper amplification on stage for their instruments, which had previously been all but drowned out by the electrified instruments. The band released their second album \"ELO 2\" in early 1973, which produced their second UK top 10 and their first US chart single, an elaborate version of the Chuck Berry classic \"Roll Over Beethoven\" (which also incorporated the first 2 or 3 lines from the first movement of Beethoven's own Fifth Symphony). ELO also made their first appearance on \"American Bandstand\". During the recording of the third album, Gibson was let go after a dispute over money, Mik Kaminski joined as violinist, and Walker left since touring was keeping him away from his family too much. Remaining cellist Edwards finished the cello parts for the album. The resulting album, \"On the Third Day\", was released in late 1973, with the American version featuring the popular single \"Showdown\". After leaving Wizzard, Hugh McDowell returned as the group's second cellist, also in late 1973, in time to appear on the \"On the Third Day\" cover in some regions, despite not having played on the album.\n1974\u20131982: Global success and concept albums.\nFor the band's fourth album, \"Eldorado\", a concept album about a daydreamer, Lynne stopped multi-tracking strings and hired Louis Clark as string arranger with an orchestra and choir. ELO's string players still continued to perform on recordings, however. The first single off the album, \"Can't Get It Out of My Head\", became their first US top 10 hit, and \"Eldorado, A Symphony\" became ELO's first gold album. Mike de Albuquerque departed the band during the recording sessions as he wished to spend more time with his family, and consequently much of the bass on the album was performed by Lynne.\nFollowing the release of \"Eldorado\", Kelly Groucutt was recruited as bassist and in early 1975, Melvyn Gale replaced Edwards on cello. The line-up stabilised as the band took to a decidedly more accessible sound. ELO had become successful in the US at this point and the group was a star attraction on the stadium and arena circuit, and appeared on \"The Midnight Special\" more than any other band in that show's history with four appearances (in 1973, 1975, 1976, and 1977).\n\"Face the Music\" was released in 1975, producing the hit singles \"Evil Woman\", their third UK top 10, and \"Strange Magic\". The opening instrumental \"Fire on High\", with its mix of strings and acoustic guitars, saw heavy exposure as the theme music for the American television programme \"CBS Sports Spectacular\" in the mid-1970s. The group toured extensively from 3 February to 13 April 1976, playing 68 shows in 76 days in the US.\nTheir sixth album, the platinum selling \"A New World Record\", became their first UK top 10 album when it was released in 1976. It contained the hit singles \"Livin' Thing\", \"Telephone Line\", \"Rockaria!\" and \"Do Ya\", the last a re-recording of The Move's final single. The band toured in support in the US only from September 1976 to April 1977 with a break in December, then an \"American Music Awards\" show appearance on 31 January 1977, plus a one-off gig in San Diego in August 1977.\n\"A New World Record\" was followed by a multi-platinum selling album, the double-LP \"Out of the Blue\", in 1977. \"Out of the Blue\" featured the singles \"Turn to Stone\", \"Sweet Talkin' Woman\", \"Mr. Blue Sky\", and \"Wild West Hero\", each becoming a hit in the United Kingdom. The band then set out on a nine-month, 92-date world tour, with an enormous set and a hugely expensive spaceship stage with fog machines and a laser display. In the United States the concerts were billed as \"The Big Night\" and were their largest to date, with 62,000 people seeing them at Cleveland Stadium. \"The Big Night\" went on to become the highest-grossing live concert tour in music history up to that point (1978). The band played at London's Wembley Arena for eight straight sold-out nights during the tour, another record at the time.\nDuring an Australian tour in early 1978, Electric Light Orchestra were presented with 9 platinum awards for the albums \"Out of the Blue\" and \"New World Record\".\nIn 1979, the multi-platinum album \"Discovery\" was released, reaching number one on the UK Albums Chart. Although the biggest hit on the album (also ELO's biggest hit overall) was the rock song \"Don't Bring Me Down\", the album was noted for its heavy disco influence. \"Discovery\" also produced the hits \"Shine a Little Love\" (their only No. 1 hit on a US singles chart---Radio &amp; Records (R&amp;R)), \"Last Train to London\", \"Confusion\", and \"The Diary of Horace Wimp\". Another song, \"Midnight Blue\", was released as a single in southeast Asia. The band recorded promotional videos for all the songs on the album.\nBy the end of 1979, ELO had reached the peak of their stardom, selling millions of albums and singles, and even inspiring a parody/tribute song on the Randy Newman album \"Born Again\", titled \"The Story of a Rock and Roll Band\". During 1979, Jeff Lynne also turned down an invitation for ELO to headline the August 1979 Knebworth Festival concerts. That allowed Led Zeppelin the chance to headline instead.\nIn January 1980, Hugh McDowell, Melvyn Gale, and Mik Kaminski were fired, as Jeff Lynne sought to take the band in a more modern direction. Later that year, Lynne was asked to write for the soundtrack of the musical film \"Xanadu\" and provided half of the songs, with the other half written by John Farrar and performed by the film's star Olivia Newton-John. The film performed poorly at the box office, but the soundtrack did exceptionally well, eventually going double platinum. The album spawned hit singles from both Newton-John (\"Magic\", a No. 1 hit in the United States, and \"Suddenly\" with Cliff Richard) and ELO (\"I'm Alive\", which went gold, \"All Over the World\" and \"Don't Walk Away\"). The title track, performed by both Newton-John and ELO, is ELO's only song to top the UK singles chart. More than a quarter of a century later, \"Xanadu\", a Broadway musical based on the film, opened on 10 July 2007 at the Helen Hayes Theatre to uniformly good reviews. It received four Tony Award nominations. The musical received its UK premiere in London in October 2015.\nIn 1981, ELO's sound changed again with the science fiction concept album \"Time\", a throwback to earlier, more progressive rock albums like \"Eldorado\". With the string section now departed, synthesisers took a dominating role, as was the trend in the larger music scene of the time; although studio strings were present on some of the tracks conducted by Rainer Pietsch, the overall soundscape had a more electronic feel in keeping with the futuristic nature of the album. \"Time\" topped the UK charts for two weeks and was the last ELO studio album to be certified platinum in the United Kingdom until \"Alone in the Universe\" in 2015. Singles from the album included \"Hold On Tight\", \"Twilight\", \"The Way Life's Meant to Be\", \"Here Is the News\" and \"Ticket to the Moon\". However, the release of the single for \"Rain Is Falling\" in 1982 was the band's first single in the US to fail to reach the \"Billboard\" Top 200 since 1975, and the release of \"The Way Life's Meant to Be\" similarly was their first single in the UK to fail to chart since 1976. The band embarked on their last world tour to promote the LP. For the tour, Kaminski returned to the line-up on violin, whilst Louis Clark (synthesizers) and Dave Morgan (guitar, keyboards, synthesizers, vocals) also joined the on stage lineup. Clark had previously handled string arrangements for the band.\n1983\u20131986: \"Secret Messages\", \"Balance of Power\", disbanding.\nJeff Lynne wanted to follow \"Time\" with a double album, but CBS blocked his plan on the grounds that a double vinyl album would be too expensive and not sell as well as a single record, so as a result, the new album was edited down to a single disc and released as \"Secret Messages\" in 1983; many of the out-takes were later released on \"Afterglow\" or as B-sides of singles. The album was a hit in the UK reaching the top 5, but its release was undermined by a string of bad news that there would be no tour to promote the LP. Lynne, discouraged by the dwindling crowds on the \"Time\" tour, CBS's order to cut \"Secret Messages\" down to one disc, and his falling out with manager Don Arden, decided to end ELO in late 1983.\nDrummer Bevan moved on to play drums for Black Sabbath, and bassist Groucutt, unhappy with no touring income that year, decided to sue Lynne and Jet Records in November 1983, eventually resulting in a settlement for the sum of \u00a3300,000 (equivalent to \u00a3994,300 in 2018). While \"Secret Messages\" debuted at number four in the United Kingdom, it subsequently performed poorly in the charts, with a lack of hit singles (though \"Rock 'n' Roll Is King\" was a sizeable hit in UK, the US and Australia) and a lukewarm media response.\nThat same year, Lynne moved into production work: having already produced two tracks for the Dave Edmunds album \"Information\", he would go on to produce six cuts for his next, \"Riff Raff\" in 1984, and one cut on the Everly Brothers reunion album \"EB 84\". He also composed a track for former ABBA member Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog's 1985 album \"Eyes of a Woman\".\nLynne and Tandy went on to record tracks for the 1984 \"Electric Dreams\" soundtrack under Lynne's name; however, Lynne was contractually obliged to make one more ELO album. So Lynne, Bevan and Tandy returned to the studio in 1984 and 1985 as a three-piece (with Christian Schneider playing saxophone on some tracks and Lynne again doubling on bass in addition to his usual guitar in the absence of an official bass player) to record \"Balance of Power\", released early in 1986 after some delays. Though the single \"Calling America\" placed in the Top 30 in the United Kingdom (number 28) and Top 20 in the States, subsequent singles failed to chart. The album lacked actual classical strings, which were replaced once again by synthesizers, played by Tandy and Lynne. However, despite being a 3-piece, much of the album was made by Lynne alone, with Tandy and Bevan giving their additions later.\nThe band was then rejoined by Kaminski, Clark and Morgan, adding Martin Smith on bass guitar, and proceeded to perform a small number of live ELO performances in 1986, including shows in England and Germany along with US appearances on \"American Bandstand\", \"Solid Gold\", then at Disneyland that summer. ELO performed at the Heart Beat 86 charity concert organised by Bevan in the band's hometown of Birmingham on 15 March 1986; a hint of Lynne's future was seen when George Harrison appeared onstage during the encore, joining in the all-star jam of \"Johnny B. Goode\". ELO's last performance for several years occurred on 13 July 1986 in Stuttgart, Germany playing as opening act to Rod Stewart. With Lynne no longer under contractual obligation to attend further scheduled performances, ELO effectively disbanded after that final show in Stuttgart in 1986, but there was no announcement made of it for the next two years, during which George Harrison's Lynne-produced album \"Cloud Nine\" and the pair's follow-up (with Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan and Tom Petty as Traveling Wilburys) \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1\" were released.\n1989\u20131999: ELO Part II.\nBev Bevan (under an agreement with Lynne, who co-owned the ELO name with him) continued on in 1989 as ELO Part II, initially with no other former ELO members, but with ELO's main orchestra conductor, Louis Clark. Bevan also recruited Eric Troyer, Pete Haycock, and Neil Lockwood. ELO Part II released their debut album \"Electric Light Orchestra Part Two\" in May 1991, featuring songs written primarily by Troyer and Haycock. Mik Kaminski, Kelly Groucutt and Hugh McDowell, at the time working in a group called OrKestra, joined the group for their first tour in 1991. While McDowell did not stay, Groucutt and Kaminski became fully-fledged members.\nIn 1994, after the departure of Haycock and Lockwood, the remaining five members of Part II recorded \"Moment of Truth\" with their newest member, singer-songwriter and guitarist Phil Bates. This lineup toured up to 1999, following which Bates was replaced by Parthenon Huxley. Bevan retired from the lineup later that year and sold his share of the ELO name to Jeff Lynne in 2000, after Lynne had expressed his dismay that in certain areas the band were billed as 'ELO', rather than with '...Part II' added, suggesting it was the original outfit. The remaining band members continued after they changed the group's name to The Orchestra. In 2001 The Orchestra released their debut (and insofar only) album \"No Rewind\". The Orchestra continues to tour, although Kaminski is the sole remaining member of the group to have been a member or affiliate of ELO, following Kelly Groucutt's death in 2009 and Louis Clark's in 2021.\n2000\u20132001: Reformation.\nLynne's comeback with ELO began in 2000 with the release of a retrospective box set, \"Flashback\", containing three CDs of remastered tracks and a handful of out-takes and unfinished works, most notably a new version of ELO's only UK number one hit \"Xanadu\". In 2001 \"Zoom,\" ELO's first album of new material since 1986, was released. Though billed and marketed as an ELO album, the only returning member other than Lynne was Tandy, who performed on one track. Guest musicians included former Beatles Ringo Starr and George Harrison. Upon completion of the album, Lynne reformed the band with completely new members, including his then-girlfriend Rosie Vela (who had released her own album, \"Zazu\", in 1986) and announced that ELO would tour again. Tandy rejoined the band a short time afterwards for two television live performances: \"VH1 Storytellers\" and a PBS concert shot at CBS Television City, later titled \"Zoom Tour Live\" and released on DVD. Besides Lynne, Tandy and Vela, the new live ELO lineup included Gregg Bissonette (drums, backing vocals), Matt Bissonette (bass guitar, backing vocals), Marc Mann (guitars, keyboards, backing vocals), Peggy Baldwin (cello), and Sarah O'Brien (cello). However, the planned tour was cancelled, reportedly due to poor ticket sales.\n2001\u20132013: Non-performing work, reissues and miniature reunions.\nFrom 2001 to 2007, Harvest and Epic/Legacy reissued ELO's back catalogue. Included amongst the remastered album tracks were unreleased songs and outtakes, including two new singles. The first was \"Surrender\" which registered on the lower end of the UK Singles Chart at number 81, some 30 years after it was written in 1976. The other single was \"Latitude 88 North\".\nIn August 2010, Eagle Rock Entertainment released \"Live \u2013 The Early Years\" in the UK as a DVD compilation that included \"Fusion \u2013 Live in London\" (1976) along with previously unreleased live performances at Brunel University (1973) and on the German TV show \"Rockpalast\" (1974). \"The Essential Electric Light Orchestra\" artwork was re-jigged to feature two different covers. The US and Australian releases shared one design, while the rest of the world featured the other for a new double album release in October 2011.\n\"\" was released on 8 October 2012. It is an album of re-recordings of ELO's greatest hits, performed by Lynne exclusively, along with a new song titled \"Point of No Return\". Released to coincide with Lynne's second solo album release \"Long Wave,\" these new albums contained advertisement cards, announcing the re-release of expanded and remastered versions of both the 2001 album \"Zoom\" and Lynne's debut solo album \"Armchair Theatre\", originally released in 1990. Both albums were re-released in April 2013 with various bonus tracks. Also released was the live album, \"Electric Light Orchestra Live\", showcasing songs from the Zoom tour. All three releases also featured new studio recordings as bonus tracks.\nThough not billed as Electric Light Orchestra (or the abbreviated ELO), in 2012, Lynne and Tandy reunited, largely under Lynne's name, to perform stripped-down acoustic versions of their ELO hits for the BBC television special \"Jeff Lynne Acoustic: Live from Bungalow Palace\".\nLynne and Tandy reunited again on 12 November 2013 to perform, under the name Jeff Lynne and Friends, \"Livin' Thing\" and \"Mr. Blue Sky\" at the Children in Need Rocks concert at Hammersmith Eventim Apollo, London. The backing orchestra was the BBC Concert Orchestra, with Chereene Allen on lead violin.\n2014\u2013present: Jeff Lynne's ELO.\nThe success of the Children in Need performance was followed by support from BBC Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans, who had Lynne as his on-air guest and asked his listeners if they wanted to see ELO perform. The 50,000 tickets for the resulting BBC Radio 2's \"Festival in a Day\" in Hyde Park on 14 September 2014 sold out in 15 minutes. Billed as \"Jeff Lynne's ELO\", Lynne and Richard Tandy were backed by the Take That/Gary Barlow band from the Children in Need concert, led by Mike Stevens and the BBC Concert Orchestra. Lynne chose to use the name as a response to ELO offshoots ELO Part II and The Orchestra. Chereene Allen was again the lead violinist for the band. The development of modern digital processing added a smoother finish to the work, which led Lynne to reconsider his preference for studio work, hinting at a UK tour in 2015.\nOn 8 February 2015, Jeff Lynne's ELO played at the Grammy Awards for the first time. They performed a medley of \"Evil Woman\" and \"Mr. Blue Sky\" with Ed Sheeran, who introduced them as \"A man and a band who I love\".\nOn 10 September 2015, it was announced that a new ELO album would be released. The album was to be under the moniker of Jeff Lynne's ELO, with the band signed to Columbia Records. \"Alone in the Universe\" was released on 13 November 2015. The album was ELO's first album of new material since 2001's \"Zoom\". The first track, and single, \"When I Was a Boy\" was made available for streaming on the same day and a music video for the song was also released. A small promotional tour followed the album's release which saw Jeff Lynne's ELO perform a full concert for \"BBC Radio 2\" along with their first two shows in the United States in 30 years, both which sold out very quickly. Jeff Lynne's ELO also made rare US television appearances on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\", \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" and \"CBS This Morning\". A 19-date European tour was announced for 2016, with the band playing the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury Festival on 26 June 2016.\nIn 2017 they played their \"Alone in the Universe\" tour. That same year, on 7 April, they played at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as they were inducted during the 32nd Annual Induction Ceremony.\nThe band continued to tour in 2018 in North America and Europe. A video was created for the City of Birmingham which used the original recording of \"Mr. Blue Sky\" as its music; this was played at the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games Closing Ceremony during the handover presentation of Birmingham 2022.\nOn 3 August 2018, \"Secret Messages\" was reissued \"as originally conceived\" as a double album. It included several cut tracks, such as the CD exclusive bonus track \"Time After Time\", B-side exclusives \"Buildings Have Eyes\" and \"After All\", the \"Afterglow\" exclusives \"Mandalay\" and \"Hello My Old Friend\", and the 2001 reissue exclusives \"Endless Lies\" and \"No Way Out\".\nOn 22 October 2018, Lynne announced that Jeff Lynne's ELO would embark on a 2019 North American tour from June to August 2019.\nELO released their 14th album, \"From Out of Nowhere\", on 1 November 2019. While a tour from the album was announced to begin in October 2020, the official Jeff Lynne's ELO Twitter page then later announced that the tour was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn 18 March 2024, ELO announced the Over And Out Tour, a final tour of North America that would span from August to October 2024.\nTandy died in 2024, at the age of 76. Lynne announced his death on social media on 1 May 2024, and said Tandy had been \"a remarkable musician and friend.\"\nOn 21 October 2024, it was announced that ELO would perform a farewell concert at the BST event in Hyde Park, London, on 13 July 2025. That same month, it was reiterated that Lynne was \"unambiguous\" about the tour being the band's last.\nLegacy and influence.\nAccording to music journalist Simon Price, ELO is \nIn November 2016, Jeff Lynne's ELO won Band of the Year at the Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards. In October 2016, ELO were nominated for the 2017 class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the first time. It was the first time the Hall had announced in advance the members of bands who would be inducted; the members of ELO listed were Jeff Lynne, Roy Wood, Bev Bevan and Richard Tandy. On 20 December 2016, it was announced ELO had been elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Class of 2017."}

{"id": "10487", "revid": "44217690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10487", "title": "Evil Dead II", "text": "Evil Dead II (also known in publicity materials as Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn) is a 1987 American comedy horror film directed by Sam Raimi, who co-wrote it with Scott Spiegel. The second installment in the \"Evil Dead\" film series, it is considered both a remake and sequel (or \"requel\") to \"The Evil Dead\" (1981). It stars Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams, who vacations with his girlfriend to a remote cabin in the woods. He discovers an audio tape of recitations from a book of ancient texts, and when the recording is played, it unleashes a number of demons which possess and torment him.\nAfter the critical and commercial failure of \"Crimewave\" (1985), Raimi, producer Robert Tapert, and Campbell began work on a sequel to \"The Evil Dead\" at the insistence of their publicist Irvin Shapiro. Having endorsed the original film, author Stephen King brought the project to the attention of producer Dino De Laurentiis, with whom he had been making his directorial debut \"Maximum Overdrive\" (1986). De Laurentiis agreed to provide financial backing, and assigned the filmmakers a considerably larger budget than they had worked with on the original film. Although Raimi had devised a premise set in the Middle Ages and involving time travel, De Laurentiis requested that the film be similar to its predecessor.\n\"Evil Dead II\" was shot in Wadesboro, North Carolina and Detroit, Michigan in 1986, and featured extensive stop-motion animation and prosthetic makeup effects created by a team of artists that included Mark Shostrom, Greg Nicotero, Robert Kurtzman and Tom Sullivan, the latter of whom returned from the original film. The finished film was released in the United States on March 13, 1987; due to its high level of violence, it was released through a pseudonymous distributor to curb an anticipated X rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. Much like \"The Evil Dead\", it was widely acclaimed by critics, who praised its humor, Raimi's direction, and Campbell's performance; many have considered it superior to its predecessor and similarly as one of the greatest horror films ever made. Despite being given a somewhat limited release, it was a minor box office success, grossing just under $6 million.\nAs with the first film, \"Evil Dead II\" has accumulated a large, international cult following. In 1992, it was followed by the direct sequel \"Army of Darkness\", which utilized Raimi's original premise; in 2013, it was followed by the soft reboot and continuation \"Evil Dead\"; and in 2015, it was followed by the television series \"Ash vs Evil Dead\". A fifth film in the series, \"Evil Dead Rise\", was released on April 21, 2023.\nPlot.\nMichigan State University students Ash Williams and his girlfriend, Linda, take a romantic getaway to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. While in it, Ash plays a tape of archaeologist Raymond Knowby, the cabin's previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the \"Book of the Dead\", \"Necronomicon Ex-Mortis\", which he uncovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an unseen evil force, known as the Kandarian Demon, that kills and possesses Linda, turning her into a \"deadite\". Ash decapitates Linda with a shovel and buries her in a shallow grave near the cabin. At dawn, the evil force throws Ash through the woods. He briefly becomes possessed by the demon, but when day breaks, he is inexplicably returned to normal.\nHe attempts to flee the area but finds that the bridge to the cabin has been destroyed. The entity chases him back to the cabin, where Linda's revived head bites his hand. He runs to the shed, where her headless body lunges at him with a chainsaw, but he overpowers and slashes the deadite Linda to death. His right hand becomes possessed and tries to kill him. Ash severs it with the chainsaw before attempting to shoot it with a shotgun, but the hand mocks him and ultimately escapes. Meanwhile, Knowby's daughter Annie, and her research partner, Ed Getley, return from the dig with the missing pages of the \"Necronomicon\", only to stumble upon the destroyed bridge. They enlist repairman Jake and his girlfriend Bobby Joe to lead them in another route to the cabin. There, they find an embattled Ash covered in blood, who accidentally shoots Bobby Joe. Deducing that he murdered Annie's parents, Annie and the others lock him in the cellar.\nThe four new arrivals listen to the rest of Knowby's recording, detailing his wife Henrietta's possession by the Kandarian Demon, and that he killed her before burying her in the cellar. Henrietta, now a deadite, possesses Ed, whom Ash dismembers with an axe. Bobby Joe attempts to escape through the woods when Ash's severed hand latches onto hers, but demonically possessed trees attack and drag her to her death. Annie translates two of the \"Necronomicon\"s pages, which portray a fabled hero with a blade for a hand and detail a ritual that will make the evil into corporeal flesh and then open a rift in time and space into which it could be banished. Before they could perform the ritual, Jake turns on them and throws the pages into the cellar, forcing them at gunpoint to locate Bobby Joe. Ash becomes possessed once more and attacks Jake. Annie retreats to the cabin and accidentally stabs Jake with a Kandarian dagger, mistaking him for the possessed Ash, before Henrietta kills him. Deadite Ash tries to kill Annie, but returns to his normal self upon seeing Linda's necklace.\nWith Annie's help, Ash modifies the chainsaw, attaches it to the stump of his right arm, and cuts the shotgun's barrel. After finding the missing pages of the \"Necronomicon\" in the cellar, Ash kills Henrietta. Annie starts reciting the incantation, as the trees outside begin wrecking the cabin and a large demon manifests itself and is barely kept at bay by Ash. Annie attempts to finish the second half of the incantation, but Ash's severed hand uses the dagger to stab her in the back. She manages to complete the ritual with her last breath before succumbing to her wound. The incantation opens up a whirling temporal vortex which not only draws in the demon, but also Ash and his Oldsmobile Delta 88.\nAsh and his Oldsmobile land in the Middle Ages. A group of knights confront him and initially mistake him for a deadite, but are quickly distracted when a real harpy-like deadite appears. Ash blasts it with his shotgun and they hail him as a hero who has come to save them. Realizing that he was the hero prophesied in the book, Ash breaks down and screams in anguish as they hail him.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nThe concept of a sequel to \"The Evil Dead\" was discussed during location shooting on the first film. Irvin Shapiro, the film's publicist, pushed writer/director Sam Raimi to devise a premise for such a film. Working with screenwriter Sheldon Lettich, Raimi settled on a story in which Ash was sucked through a time portal to the Middle Ages, where he would encounter more deadites. Shapiro was enticed by the concept, and took out advertisements in trade magazines to promote the project, then titled \"Evil Dead II: Evil Dead and the Army of Darkness\", in May 1984. After Universal Pictures and 20th Century Fox passed on it, the sequel was shelved in favor of Raimi's next film, \"Crimewave\" (1985), a comedy/crime film co-written with Joel and Ethan Coen.\nAfter \"Crimewave\" was released to critical and audience disinterest, Raimi and his partners at Renaissance Pictures, producer Robert Tapert and actor/co-producer Bruce Campbell, took Shapiro up on his sequel offer, knowing that another flop would further stall their already-lagging careers. Development of \"Evil Dead II\" initially began in collaboration with Embassy Pictures, which had co-financed and distributed \"Crimewave\", but the filmmakers eventually felt that they were being stalled after five months' pre-production work, and began conducting interviews with prospective cast and crew members. Around this time, producer Dino De Laurentiis, the owner of production and distribution company De Laurentiis Entertainment Group (DEG), asked Raimi if he would be interested in directing an adaptation of the Stephen King novel \"Thinner\". Raimi turned down the offer, but De Laurentiis remained in touch with the young filmmaker.\nThe \"Thinner\" adaptation was part of a deal between De Laurentiis and King to produce several adaptations of King's successful horror novels and short stories. At the time, King was directing the first such adaptation, \"Maximum Overdrive\" (1986), based on his short story \"Trucks\". He had dinner with a crew member who had been among those interviewed by Raimi and his colleagues about \"Evil Dead II\", and told King that the film was having trouble attracting funding. Upon hearing this, King, who had written a glowing review of the first film that helped it become an audience favorite at Cannes, called De Laurentiis and asked him to fund the film. While he was initially skeptical, De Laurentiis met with Renaissance, who highlighted the first film's extremely high revenue in the Italian market. Within twenty minutes, De Laurentiis agreed to finance \"Evil Dead II\" for $3.6 million. Raimi and Tapert had desired $4 million for the production, but De Laurentiis requested a film that was similar to its predecessor instead of their original medieval-themed proposal, which was instead used for the second sequel, \"Army of Darkness\" (1992).\nWriting.\nDespite Raimi's crew having only recently received the funding necessary to produce the film, the script had been written for some time, having been composed largely during the production of \"Crimewave\". Raimi contacted his old friend Scott Spiegel, who had collaborated with Campbell and others on the Super 8 mm films they had produced during their childhood in Michigan. Most of these films had been comedies, and Spiegel felt that \"Evil Dead II\" should be less straight horror than the first. Initially, the opening sequence included all five of the original film's characters; however, in an effort to save time and money, all but Ash and Linda were cut from the final draft. The film went through several other drafts, including a group of escaped convicts holding Ash captive in the cabin while searching for buried treasure.\nSpiegel and Raimi wrote most of the film in their house in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California, where they were living with the aforementioned Coen brothers, as well as actors Frances McDormand, Kathy Bates, and Holly Hunter (the primary inspiration for the Bobby Joe character). Due both to the distractions of their house guests and the films they were involved with, \"Crimewave\" and Josh Becker's \"Thou Shalt Not Kill... Except\", the script took a long time to finish.\nAmong the film's many inspirations include the Three Stooges and slapstick comedy films. Ash's fights with his disembodied hand come from a film made by Spiegel as a teenager titled \"Attack of the Helping Hand\", which was itself inspired by television commercials advertising Hamburger Helper. The \"laughing room\" scene, where all the objects in the room seemingly come to life and begin to cackle maniacally along with Ash, came about after Spiegel jokingly used a gooseneck lamp to visually demonstrate a Popeye-esque laugh. Spiegel's humorous influence can be seen throughout the film, perhaps most prominently in certain visual jokes. For instance, when Ash traps his rogue hand under a pile of books, on top is \"A Farewell to Arms\".\nWhile Raimi and Campbell have stated that \"Evil Dead II\" was intended as a direct sequel, there are differences between the first installment and the recap at the beginning of the second: for example, the Necronomicon is destroyed in a fire by Ash during the conclusion of \"The Evil Dead\", but remains intact in \"Evil Dead II\". The corpses of Ash's friends from the first are absent, and are never mentioned. The cabin itself remains perfectly intact until the events of this film, despite much of it having been destroyed in the original film.\nFilming.\nWith the script completed and a production company secured, principal photography began on \"Evil Dead II\". The production commenced in Wadesboro, North Carolina, not far from De Laurentiis' offices in Wilmington. De Laurentiis had wanted them to film in his elaborate Wilmington studio, but the production team felt uneasy being so close to the producer, so they moved to Wadesboro, approximately three hours away. Steven Spielberg had previously filmed \"The Color Purple\" in Wadesboro, and the large white farmhouse used as an exterior location in that film became the production office for \"Evil Dead II\". Most of the film was shot in the woods near that farmhouse, or J.R. Faison Junior High School, where the interior cabin set was located.\nMark Shostrom served as the film's makeup effects supervisor, and delegated work to Robert Kurtzman, Greg Nicotero, and Howard Berger of KNB EFX Group. The shot of undead Henrietta's flying eyeball was accomplished using a ping pong ball provided and painted by KNB EFX. Effects artist Verne Hyde, who joined the North Carolina unit in 1986 after filming had already begun, experimented with various rigs in order to achieve the effect Raimi desired. It was ultimately achieved by mounting the eyeball on a small, spinning motor, attached to a wand bolted directly onto the camera.\nTed Raimi, director Sam's younger brother, had been briefly involved in the first film, acting as a fake Shemp. However, in \"Evil Dead II\", he plays a larger role as the undead Henrietta. Raimi wore a full-body, latex costume, and was also made to crouch in a small hole in the floor acting as a \"cellar\"; on one day, he did both. Raimi became extremely overheated to the point that his costume was filled with liters of sweat; Nicotero describes pouring the fluid into several Dixie cups so as to get it out of the costume. The sweat is also visible on-screen, dripping out of the costume's ear, in the scene where Henrietta spins around over Annie's head.\nFor Ash's chainsaw hand, effects artist Verne Hyde modified a real chainsaw, replacing its gasoline engine with a small, 12-volt electric motor, leaving space for Campbell to insert his hand into the body of the saw. The teeth of the saw were filed down for safety purposes, and tobacco smoke was pumped through a plastic tube that ran up Campbell's leg to simulate chainsaw smoke.\nThe crew sneaked various in-jokes into the film itself, such as the clawed glove of Freddy Krueger (the primary antagonist of Wes Craven's \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" series of slasher films) which hangs in the cabin's basement and tool shed. This was, at least partially, a reference to a scene in the original \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\", where the character Nancy Thompson (portrayed by Heather Langenkamp) dozes off watching the original \"Evil Dead\" on a television set in her room. In turn, that scene was a reference to the torn \"The Hills Have Eyes\" poster seen in the original \"Evil Dead\" film, which was itself a reference to a torn \"Jaws\" poster in \"The Hills Have Eyes\". The real life clawed glove appearing in \"Evil Dead II\" has been attributed to Shostrom, who was also working on \"\" at around the same time as \"Evil Dead II\", suggesting he borrowed it from the \"Dream Warriors\" set for a day. The rat seen in the cellar was nicknamed \"Se\u00f1or Cojones\" by the crew (\"cojones\" is Spanish slang for \"testicles\").\nAt the film's wrap party, the crew held a talent contest where Raimi and Campbell sang the Byrds' \"Eight Miles High\", with Nicotero on guitar.\nMusic.\nThe score was composed by Joseph LoDuca, who also composed the other two scores in the \"Evil Dead\" trilogy. In 2017, Waxwork Records released the soundtrack on vinyl for the film's 30th anniversary.\nRelease.\nPre-release.\nLike the original film, \"Evil Dead II\" had censorship difficulties due to its high level of violence. Because DEG was a member of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), Raimi was contractually obliged to shoot the film with the intention of it earning an R rating. Upon reviewing the completed film, DEG's executives felt that \"Evil Dead II\" would almost certainly receive an X rating, which would limit its commercial prospects. Lawrence Gleason, the company's president of marketing and distribution, felt that if it were to be cut for an R, the film \"would have been about 62 minutes long\" and that both Raimi's vision and the audience's enjoyment would have been sabotaged as a result.\nUltimately, DEG decided not to submit \"Evil Dead II\" to the MPAA for review or be credited onscreen for their involvement in it. Instead, Rosebud Releasing Corporation, a shell company run by De Laurentiis' son-in-law Alex De Benedetti, was set up to handle the film's US release, allowing it to be shown unrated. Although Rosebud technically did not have a distribution network, DEG had already booked the film in 340 cinemas across the country, and had created and paid for the film's advertising campaign. Rosebud's logo, a rose blooming in time-lapse photography against a painted sky backdrop, was designed and shot by Raimi himself.\nHome media.\nThe film was released on VHS by Vestron Video in 1987. Another VHS release came from Anchor Bay Entertainment on February 17, 1998. In a similar fashion to the first \"Evil Dead\" film and \"Army of Darkness\", there have been numerous DVD releases of \"Evil Dead II\". The film was released on DVD by Anchor Bay on August 29, 2000, in the form of a limited edition tin, and was re-released by Anchor Bay on September 27, 2005, designed to resemble the \"Necronomicon\". On October 2, 2007, the film was released on Blu-ray, and on November 15, 2011, it was re-released on Blu-ray and DVD by Lionsgate Home Entertainment for its 25th anniversary. On September 13, 2016, the film was re-released on Blu-ray by Lionsgate. A 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray version of the film was released on December 11, 2018.\nThe film was released on DVD in the United Kingdom in 2003 as part of a region 2 \"Evil Dead\" trilogy box set. In 2013, the trilogy saw another UK release on Blu-ray, released by StudioCanal. A 25th Anniversary Wood Edition was released in Germany by StudioCanal in 2007. The film was released on Blu-ray in Australia in 2014, alongside \"The Evil Dead\", \"Army of Darkness\", and the 2013 reboot, as part of an \"Evil Dead\" Anthology box set. The film has been released together with the first \"Evil Dead\" film by Green Nara Media in South Korea in region A.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"Evil Dead II\" opened on March 13, 1987, to an unimpressive weekend gross of $807,260, due to its limited release in 310 theaters at the time. However, after spending a little over a month in theaters, it ultimately grossed $5,924,421 worldwide.\nCritical response.\n \"Empire\" magazine praised the film, saying \"the gaudily gory, virtuoso, hyper-kinetic horror sequel uses every trick in the cinematic book\" and confirms that \"Bruce Campbell and Raimi are gods\". Caryn James of \"The New York Times\" called it \"genuine, if bizarre, proof of Sam Raimi's talent and developing skill.\" Leonard Maltin originally rated the film with two stars, but later increased the rating to three stars.\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as \"a fairly sophisticated satire, that makes you want to get up and shuffle.\" He praised the film's sense of surrealism, comedic timing, and \"grubby, low-budget intensity.\" Ebert states that \"if you know it's all special effects, and if you've seen a lot of other movies and have a sense of humor, you might have a great time at \"Evil Dead 2\".\" Richard Harrington of \"The Washington Post\" wrapped up his review stating that \"the acting is straight out of '50s B-movies. The exposition is clumsy, the sound track corny, the denouement silly. Then again, who said bad taste was easy?\" Conversely, Pat Graham of \"Chicago Reader\" disliked the mix of horror and comedy, writing in his review that \"the pop-up humor and smirkiness suggest Raimi's aspiring to the fashionable company of the brothers Coen, though on the basis of this strained effort I'd say he's overshot the mark.\"\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked the film #19 on their list of the \"Top 50 Cult Films\".\n\"Sight and Sound\" ranked it #34 on their 50 Funniest Films of All Time list. In 2008, \"Empire\" magazine included \"Evil Dead II\" on their list of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\", ranked #49.\nJ.C. Ma\u00e7ek III of \"PopMatters\" wrote, \"Equal parts remake and sequel, the second film brought back Bruce Campbell as Ash and was every bit as gory and horrific as the first film with more tree rape and dismemberment and blood splatters than ever. On the other hand, \"Evil Dead II\" is also an absolutely hilarious and uproarious intentional comedy.\"\nIn 2016, James Charisma of \"Playboy\" ranked the film #12 on a list of \"15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals\".\nIn popular culture.\n\"The Elvis Dead\", an English comic stage show, retells \"Evil Dead II\" in the style of Elvis Presley.\nThe 1993 hit first-person shooter video game \"Doom\" was inspired by \"Evil Dead II\". The game's programmer John Carmack came up with the game's concept about using technology to fight demons, inspired by the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" campaigns the team played, combining the styles of \"Evil Dead II\" and \"Aliens\".\nThe 1991 hit song \"People Are Still Having Sex\" by LaTour contains a dialogue sample of the, \"... hello lover!\" line from the film.\nThe 2023 music video for \"Bogus Operandi\" by The Hives is heavily inspired by \"Evil Dead II\". The music video features a demonic tape, forest point-of-view shots, and white eyed zombies."}
{"id": "10489", "revid": "1271167432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10489", "title": "Edwin Hubble", "text": "Edwin Powell Hubble (November 20, 1889 \u2013 September 28, 1953) was an American astronomer. He played a crucial role in establishing the fields of extragalactic astronomy and observational cosmology.\nHubble proved that many objects previously thought to be clouds of dust and gas and classified as \"nebulae\" were actually galaxies beyond the Milky Way. He used the strong direct relationship between a classical Cepheid variable's luminosity and pulsation period (discovered in 1908 by Henrietta Swan Leavitt) for scaling galactic and extragalactic distances.\nHubble confirmed in 1929 that the recessional velocity of a galaxy increases with its distance from Earth, a behavior that became known as Hubble's law, although it had been proposed two years earlier by Georges Lema\u00eetre. The Hubble law implies that the universe is expanding. A decade before, the American astronomer Vesto Slipher had provided the first evidence that the light from many of these nebulae was strongly red-shifted, indicative of high recession velocities.\nHubble's name is most widely recognized for the Hubble Space Telescope, which was named in his honor, with a model prominently displayed in his hometown of Marshfield, Missouri.\nEarly life and education.\nEdwin Hubble was born in 1889 to Virginia Lee Hubble (n\u00e9e James) (1864\u20131934) and John Powell Hubble, an insurance executive, in Marshfield, Missouri, and moved to Wheaton, Illinois, in\u00a01900. In his younger days, he was noted more for his athletic prowess than his intellectual abilities, although he did earn good grades in every subject except spelling. Edwin was a gifted athlete, playing baseball, football, and running track in both high school and college. He won seven first places and a third place in a single high school track and field meet in 1906, and he played a variety of positions on the basketball court, from center to shooting guard. Hubble led the University of Chicago's basketball team to their first Big Ten Conference title in 1907.\nUndergraduate studies.\nHubble's studies at the University of Chicago were concentrated on mathematics, astronomy and philosophy, which resulted in a Bachelor of Science degree by 1910. For a year he was also a student laboratory assistant for the physicist Robert Millikan, a future Nobel Prize winner. Hubble also became a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity. A Rhodes Scholar, he spent three years at The Queen's College, Oxford studying jurisprudence instead of science (as a promise to his dying father), and later added studies in literature and Spanish, eventually earning his master's degree.\nIn 1909, Hubble's father moved his family from Chicago to Shelbyville, Kentucky, so that the family could live in a small town, ultimately settling in nearby Louisville. His father died in the winter of\u00a01913, while Edwin was still in England. In the following summer, Edwin returned home to care for his mother, two sisters, and younger brother, along with his brother William. The family moved once more to Everett Avenue, in Louisville's Highlands neighborhood, to accommodate Edwin and William.\nHubble was a dutiful son, who despite his intense interest in astronomy since boyhood, acquiesced to his father's request to study law, first at the University of Chicago and later at Oxford. In this time, he also took some math and science courses. After the death of his father in 1913, Edwin returned to the Midwest from Oxford but did not have the motivation to practice law. Instead, he proceeded to teach Spanish, physics and mathematics at New Albany High School in New Albany, Indiana, where he also coached the boys' basketball team. After a year of high-school teaching, he entered graduate school with the help of his former professor from the University of Chicago to study astronomy at the university's Yerkes Observatory, where he received his Ph.D. in 1921. His dissertation was titled \"Photographic Investigations of Faint Nebulae\". At Yerkes, he had access to its 40-inch refractor built in 1897, as well as an innovative 26-inch (61\u00a0cm) reflector.\nDoctoral studies.\nAfter the United States declared war on Germany in 1917 during World War I, Hubble rushed to complete his Ph.D. dissertation so he could join the military. Hubble volunteered for the United States Army and was assigned to the newly created 86th Division, where he served in the 2nd Battalion, 343rd Infantry Regiment. He rose to the rank of major, and was found fit for overseas duty on July 9, 1918; the 86th Division moved overseas, but never saw combat as it was broken up and its personnel used as replacements in other units. After the end of World War I, Hubble spent a year at University of Cambridge, where he renewed his studies of astronomy.\nCareer.\nIn 1919, Hubble was offered a staff position at the Carnegie Institution for Science's Mount Wilson Observatory, near Pasadena, California, by George Ellery Hale, the founder and director of the observatory. Hubble remained on staff at Mount Wilson until his death in 1953. Shortly before his death, Hubble became the first astronomer to use the newly completed giant reflector Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, California.\nHubble also worked as a civilian for United States Army at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland during World War II as the Chief of the External Ballistics Branch of the Ballistic Research Laboratory during which he directed a large volume of research in exterior ballistics which increased the effective firepower of bombs and projectiles. His work was facilitated by his personal development of several items of equipment for the instrumentation used in exterior ballistics, the most outstanding development being the high-speed clock camera, which made possible the study of the characteristics of bombs and low-velocity projectiles in flight. The results of his studies were credited with greatly improving design, performance, and military effectiveness of bombs and rockets. For his work there, he received the Legion of Merit award.\nDiscoveries.\nUniverse goes beyond the Milky Way galaxy.\nEdwin Hubble's arrival at Mount Wilson Observatory, California, in 1919 coincided roughly with the completion of the Hooker Telescope, then the world's largest. At that time, the prevailing view of the cosmos was that the universe consisted entirely of the Milky Way galaxy.\nUsing the Hooker Telescope at Mount Wilson, Hubble identified Cepheid variables, a standard candle discovered by Henrietta Swan Leavitt. Comparing their apparent luminosity to their intrinsic luminosity gives their distance from Earth. Hubble found Cepheids in several nebulae, including the Andromeda Nebula and Triangulum Nebula. His observations, made in 1924, proved conclusively that these nebulae were much too distant to be part of the Milky Way and were, in fact, entire galaxies outside our own; thus today they are no longer considered nebulae.\nThis was first hypothesized as early as 1755 when Immanuel Kant's \"General History of Nature and Theory of the Heavens\" appeared. Hubble's hypothesis was opposed by many in the astronomy establishment of the time, in particular by Harvard Universitybased Harlow Shapley. Despite the opposition, Hubble, then a thirty-five-year-old scientist, had his findings first published in \"The New York Times\" on , 1924, then presented them to other astronomers at the January 1, 1925, meeting of the American Astronomical Society. Hubble's results for Andromeda were not formally published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal until 1929.\nHubble's findings fundamentally changed the scientific view of the universe. Supporters state that Hubble's discovery of nebulae outside of our galaxy helped pave the way for future astronomers. Although some of his more renowned colleagues simply scoffed at his results, Hubble ended up publishing his findings on nebulae. This published work earned him an award titled the American Association Prize and five hundred dollars from Burton E. Livingston of the Committee on Awards.\nHubble also devised the most commonly used system for classifying galaxies, grouping them according to their appearance in photographic images. He arranged the different groups of galaxies in what became known as the Hubble sequence.\nRedshift increases with distance.\nHubble went on to estimate the distances to 24 extra-galactic nebulae, using a variety of methods. In 1929 Hubble examined the relationship between these distances and their radial velocities as determined from their redshifts. All of his estimated distances are now known to be too small, by up to a factor of about 7. This was due to factors such as the fact that there are two kinds of Cepheid variables or confusing bright gas clouds with bright stars. However, his distances were more or less proportional to the true distances, and combining his distances with measurements of the redshifts of the galaxies by Vesto Slipher, and by his assistant Milton L. Humason, he found a roughly linear relationship between the distances of the galaxies and their radial velocities (corrected for solar motion), a discovery that later became known as Hubble's law.\nThis meant that the greater the distance between any two galaxies, the greater their relative speed of separation. If interpreted that way, Hubble's measurements on 46 galaxies lead to a value for the Hubble constant of 500\u00a0km/s/Mpc, which is much higher than the currently accepted values of 74\u00a0km/s/Mpc (cosmic distance ladder method) or 68\u00a0km/s/Mpc (CMB method) due to errors in their distance calibrations.\nYet the reason for the redshift remained unclear. Georges Lema\u00eetre predicted on theoretical grounds based on Einstein's equations for general relativity the redshift-distance relation, and published observational support for it, two years before the discovery of Hubble's law. Although he used the term \"velocities\" in his paper (and \"apparent radial velocities\" in the introduction), he later expressed doubt about interpreting these as real velocities. In 1931 he wrote a letter to the Dutch cosmologist Willem de Sitter expressing his opinion on the theoretical interpretation of the redshift-distance relation:\nToday, the \"apparent velocities\" in question are usually thought of as an increase in proper distance that occurs due to the expansion of the universe. Light traveling through an expanding metric will experience a Hubble-type redshift, a mechanism somewhat different from the Doppler effect, although the two mechanisms become equivalent descriptions related by a coordinate transformation for nearby galaxies.\nIn the 1930s, Hubble was involved in determining the distribution of galaxies and spatial curvature. These data seemed to indicate that the universe was flat and homogeneous, but there was a deviation from flatness at large redshifts. According to Allan Sandage,\nThere were methodological problems with Hubble's survey technique that showed a deviation from flatness at large redshifts. In particular, the technique did not account for changes in luminosity of galaxies due to galaxy evolution. Earlier, in\u00a01917, Albert Einstein had found that his newly developed theory of general relativity indicated that the universe must be either expanding or contracting. Unable to believe what his own equations were telling him, Einstein introduced a cosmological constant (a\u00a0\"\") to the equations to avoid this \"problem\". When Einstein learned of Hubble's redshifts, he immediately realized that the expansion predicted by general relativity must be real, and in later life, he said that changing his equations was \"the biggest blunder of [his] life\". In fact, Einstein apparently once visited Hubble and tried to convince him that the universe was expanding.\nHubble also discovered the asteroid 1373 Cincinnati on August 30, 1935. In 1936 he wrote \"The Observational Approach to Cosmology\" and \"The Realm of the Nebulae\" which explained his approaches to extra-galactic astronomy and his view of the subject's history.\nIn December 1941, Hubble reported to the American Association for the Advancement of Science that results from a six-year survey with the Mt. Wilson telescope did not support the expanding universe theory. According to a \"Los Angeles Times\" article reporting on Hubble's remarks, \"The nebulae could not be uniformly distributed, as the telescope shows they are, and still fit the explosion idea. Explanations which try to get around what the great telescope sees, he said, fail to stand up. The explosion, for example, would have had to start long after the earth was created, and possibly even after the first life appeared here.\" (Hubble's estimate of what we now call the Hubble constant would put the Big Bang only 2 billion years ago.)\nPersonal life.\nHubble married Grace Lillian (Burke) Leib (1889\u20131980), daughter of John Patrick and Luella (Kepford) Burke, on February 26, 1924.\nHubble was raised as a Protestant Christian, but some of his later statements suggest uncertainty.\nHealth issues and death.\nHubble had a heart attack in July 1949 while on vacation in Colorado. He was cared for by his wife and continued on a modified diet and work schedule. He died of cerebral thrombosis (a blood clot in his brain) on September 28, 1953, in San Marino, California. No funeral was held for him, and his wife never revealed his burial site.\nHubble's papers comprising the bulk of his correspondence, photographs, notebooks, observing logbooks, and other materials, are held by the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. They were donated by his wife Grace Burke Hubble upon her death in 1980.\nControversies.\nAccusations concerning Lema\u00eetre's priority.\nIn 2011, the journal \"Nature\" reported claims that Hubble might have played a role in the redaction of key parts of the 1931 English translation of Lema\u00eetre's 1927 paper, which formulated what was later called Hubble's law and also gave observational evidence. Historians quoted in the article were skeptical that the redactions were part of a campaign to ensure Hubble retained priority. However, the observational astronomer Sidney van den Bergh published a paper suggesting that while the omissions may have been made by a translator, they may still have been deliberate.\nIn November 2011, the astronomer Mario Livio reported in \"Nature\" that a letter he found in the Lema\u00eetre archive demonstrated that the redaction had been made by Lema\u00eetre himself, who apparently saw no point in publishing scientific content which had already been reported in 1929 by Hubble. However, the fact remains that Lema\u00eetre published the law in French, two years prior to Hubble.\nCampaign to obtain a Nobel Prize.\nDuring Hubble's life the Nobel Prize in Physics did not cover work done in astronomy. Hubble spent much of the later part of his career attempting to have astronomy considered part of physics, instead of being a separate science. He did this largely so that astronomers\u2014including himself\u2014could be recognized by the Nobel Committee for their valuable contributions to astrophysics. This campaign was unsuccessful in Hubble's lifetime, but shortly after his death, the Nobel Prize Committee decided that astronomical work would be eligible for the physics prize. However, the Nobel prize is not awarded posthumously.\nHonors.\nPostage stamp.\nOn March 6, 2008, the United States Postal Service released a 41-cent stamp honoring Hubble on a sheet titled \"American Scientists\" designed by artist Victor Stabin. His citation reads:\nThe other scientists on the \"American Scientists\" sheet include Gerty Cori, biochemist; Linus Pauling, chemist, and John Bardeen, physicist.\nIn popular culture.\nIn the 1980 documentary \"\" by astronomer Carl Sagan, Hubble's life and work are portrayed on screen in episode 10, \"The Edge of Forever\".\nThe play \"Creation's Birthday\", written by Cornell physicist Hasan Padamsee, tells Hubble's life story."}

His mother was the Empress Fujiwara no Takaiko, who was also known after Seiwa's abdication as the Nij\u014d empress. Y\u014dzei's mother was the sister of Fujiwara no Mototsune, who would figure prominently in the young emperor's life.\nIn ancient Japan, there were four noble clans, the \"Gempeit\u014dkitsu\" (\u6e90\u5e73\u85e4\u6a58). One of these clans, the Minamoto clan (\u6e90\u6c0f) are also known as Genji, and of these, the \"Y\u014dzei Genji\" (\u967d\u6210\u6e90\u6c0f) are descended from the 57th emperor Y\u014dzei.\nY\u014dzei had nine Imperial children, born after he had abdicated.\nHe is said to have mental instability after acceding to his position at a tender young age. He concentrated on waka during his later years. His famous waka expressed his growing love by superimposing the image of the flow of the river.\nEvents of Y\u014dzei's life.\nY\u014dzei was made emperor when he was an immature, unformed young boy.\nAccording to very scanty information from the Imperial archives, including sources such as \"Rikkokushi,\" and \"Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku,\" Emperor Y\u014dzei murdered one of his retainers, an action that caused massive scandal in the Heian court. Japanese society during the Heian era was very sensitive to issues of \"pollution,\" both spiritual and personal. Deaths (especially killing animals or people) were the worst acts of pollution possible, and warranted days of seclusion in order to purify oneself. Since the Emperor was seen as a divine figure and linked to the deities, pollution of such extreme degree committed by the highest source was seen as extremely ruinous. Many of the high court officials construed Emperor Y\u014dzei's actions as exceeding the bounds of acceptable behavior, and as justifiable cause for the emperor to be forcibly deposed.\nIn Kitabatake Chikafusa's 14th-century account of Emperor Y\u014dzei's reign, the emperor is described as possessing a \"violent disposition\" and unfit to be a ruler. In the end, when Fujiwara no Mototsune, who was \"Sessh\u014d\" (regent for the child-emperor, 876\u2013880), \"Kampaku\" (chief advisor or first secretary for the emperor, 880\u2013890), and \"Daij\u014d Daijin\" (Great Minister of the Council of State), decided that Y\u014dzei should be removed from the throne, he discovered that there was general agreement amongst the \"kuge\" that this was a correct and necessary decision.\nY\u014dzei was succeeded by his father's uncle, Emperor K\u014dk\u014d; and in the reign of K\u014dk\u014d's son, Emperor Uda, the madness re-visited the tormented former emperor:\nY\u014dzei lived in retirement until the age of 80.\nThe actual site of Y\u014dzei's grave is known.

His mother was Empress Dowager Hanshi, a daughter of Prince Nakano (who was himself a son of Emperor Kanmu). Uda had five Imperial consorts and 20 Imperial children. Particularly important sons include:\nHistorical background.\nIn ancient Japan, there were four noble clans, the \"Gempeit\u014dkitsu\" . One of these clans, the Minamoto clan , is also known as Genji. Some of Uda's grandchildren were granted the surname \"Minamoto\", the most used surname for former Japanese royalty. In order to distinguish Uda's descendants from other Genji, they became known as the Uda Genji , some of which moved to \u014cmi Province and became known as Sasaki clan or .\nAmong the Uda Genji, Minamoto no Masazane , a son of succeeded in the court. Masazane became \"sadaijin\" (Minister of the Left). One of Masazane's daughters, Minamoto no Rinshi married Fujiwara no Michinaga and from this marriage three empresses dowagers and two regents (\"sessh\u014d\") were born.\nFrom Masanobu, several kuge families originated including the Niwata, Ayanok\u014dji, Itsutsuji, \u014chara and Jik\u014dji. From his fourth son Sukeyosi, the Sasaki clan originated, and thus Ky\u014dgoku clan originated. These descendants are known as \u014cmi Genji today. From this line, Sasaki Takauji made a success at the Muromachi shogunate and the Amago clan originated from his brother.\nEvents of Uda's life.\nUda's father, Emperor K\u014dk\u014d, demoted his sons from the rank of imperial royals to that of subjects in order to reduce the state expenses, as well as their political influence. Sadami was given the clan name of Minamoto and named Minamoto no Sadami. Later, in 887, when K\u014dk\u014d needed to appoint his successor, Sadami was once again promoted to the Imperial Prince rank with support of \"kampaku\" Fujiwara no Mototsune, since Sadami was adopted by a half-sister of Mototsune. After the death of his father in November of that year, Sadami\"-shinn\u014d\" ascended to the throne.\nIn the beginning of Uda's reign, Mototsune held the office of \"kampaku\" (or chancellor). Emperor Uda's reign is marked by a prolonged struggle to reassert power by the Imperial Family away from the increasing influence of the Fujiwara, beginning with the death of Mototsune in 891. Records show that shortly thereafter, Emperor Uda assigned scholars Sukeyo and Kiyoyuki, supporters of Mototsune, to provincial posts in the remote provinces of Mutsu and Higo respectively. Meanwhile, non-Fujiwara officials mainly from the Minamoto family were promoted to prominent ranks, while his trusted counselor, Sugawara no Michizane rapidly rose in rank within five years to reach the third rank in the court, and supervision of the Crown Prince's household. Meanwhile, Mototsune's son and heir, Fujiwara no Tokihira, rose in rank, but only just enough to prevent an open power struggle.\nMeanwhile, Emperor Uda attempted to return Court politics to the original spirit envisioned in the Ritsury\u014d Codes, while reviving intellectual interest in Confucian doctrine and culture. In the seventh month of 896, Emperor Uda dispatched Sugawara no Michizane to review prisoners in the capitol and provide a general amnesty for the wrongfully accused, in keeping with Chinese practices. Emperor Uda also issued edicts reinforcing peasant land rights from encroachment by powerful families in the capital or monastic institutions, while auditing tax collections made in the provinces.\nEmperor Uda stopped the practice of sending ambassadors to China . The emperor's decision was informed by what he understood as persuasive counsel from Sugawara Michizane.\nThe Special Festival of the Kamo Shrine was first held during Uda's reign.\nIn 897, Uda abdicated in favor of his eldest son, Prince Atsuhito, who would later come to be known as Emperor Daigo. Uda left behind an hortatory will or testament which offered general admonitions or precepts for his son's guidance (\"see excerpt at right\"). The document praises Fujiwara no Tokihira as an advisor but cautions against his womanizing; and Sugawara no Michizane is praised as Uda's mentor. Both were assigned by Emperor Uda to look after his son until the latter reach maturity.\nThree years later, he entered the Buddhist priesthood at age 34 in 900. Having founded the temple at Ninna-ji, Uda made it his new home after his abdication.\n His Buddhist name was Kong\u014d Kaku. He was sometimes called \"the Cloistered Emperor of Teiji \", because the name of the Buddhist hall where he resided after becoming a priest was called Teijiin.\nUda died in 931 (\"Sh\u014dhei 1, 19th day of the 7th month\") at the age of 65.\nThe actual site of Uda's grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Kyoto.\nThe Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Uda's mausoleum. It is formally named \"Kaguragaoka no Higashi no misasagi\".\nThe former emperor is buried amongst the \"Seven Imperial Tombs\" at Ry\u014dan-ji Temple in Kyoto. The mound which commemorates the Hosokawa Emperor Uda is today named \"O-uchiyama\". The emperor's burial place would have been quite humble in the period after Uda died.

{"id": "10500", "revid": "33145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10500", "title": "Earless seal", "text": "The earless seals, phocids, or true seals are one of the three main groups of mammals within the seal lineage, Pinnipedia. All true seals are members of the family Phocidae (). They are sometimes called crawling seals to distinguish them from the fur seals and sea lions of the family Otariidae. Seals live in the oceans of both hemispheres and, with the exception of the more tropical monk seals, are mostly confined to polar, subpolar, and temperate climates. The Baikal seal is the only species of exclusively freshwater seal.\nTaxonomy and evolution.\nEvolution.\nThe earliest known fossil earless seal is \"Noriphoca gaudini\" from the late Oligocene or earliest Miocene (Aquitanian) of Italy. Other early fossil phocids date from the mid-Miocene, 15 million years ago in the north Atlantic. Until recently, many researchers believed that phocids evolved separately from otariids and odobenids; and that they evolved from otter-like animals, such as \"Potamotherium\", which inhabited European freshwater lakes. Recent evidence strongly suggests a monophyletic origin for all pinnipeds from a single ancestor, possibly \"Enaliarctos\", most closely related to the mustelids and bears.\nMonk seals and elephant seals were previously believed to have first entered the Pacific through the open straits between North and South America, with the Antarctic true seals either using the same route or travelled down the west coast of Africa. It is now thought that the monk seals, elephant seals, and Antarctic seals all evolved in the southern hemisphere, and likely dispersed to their current distributions from more southern latitudes.\nTaxonomy.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, morphological phylogenetic analysis of the phocids led to new conclusions about the interrelatedness of the various genera. More recent molecular phylogenetic analyses have confirmed the monophyly of the two phocid subfamilies (Phocinae and Monachinae). The Monachinae (known as the \"southern\" seals), is composed of three tribes; the Lobodontini, Miroungini, and Monachini. The four Antarctic genera \"Hydrurga\", \"Leptonychotes\", \"Lobodon\", and \"Ommatophoca\" are part of the tribe Lobodontini. Tribe Miroungini is composed of the elephant seals. The Monk seals (\"Monachus\" and \"Neomonachus\") are all part of the tribe Monachini. Likewise, subfamily Phocinae (the \"northern\" seals) also includes three tribes; Erignathini (\"Erignathus)\", Cystophorini (\"Cystophora)\", and Phocini (all other phocines). More recently, five species have been split off from \"Phoca\", forming three additional genera.\nAlternatively the three monachine tribes have been evaluated to familiar status, which elephant seals and the Antarctic seals are more closely related to the phocines.\nBiology.\nExternal anatomy.\nAdult phocids vary from in length and in weight in the ringed seal to and in the southern elephant seal, which is the largest member of the order Carnivora. Phocids have fewer teeth than land-based members of the Carnivora, although they retain powerful canines. Some species lack molars altogether. The dental formula is:\nWhile otariids are known for speed and maneuverability, phocids are known for efficient, economical movement. This allows most phocids to forage far from land to exploit prey resources, while otariids are tied to rich upwelling zones close to breeding sites. Phocids swim by sideways movements of their bodies, using their hind flippers to fullest effect. Their fore flippers are used primarily for steering, while their hind flippers are bound to the pelvis in such a way that they cannot bring them under their bodies to walk on them. They are more streamlined than fur seals and sea lions, so they can swim more effectively over long distances. However, because they cannot turn their hind flippers downward, they are very clumsy on land, having to wriggle with their front flippers and abdominal muscles.\nPhocid respiratory and circulatory systems are adapted to allow diving to considerable depths, and they can spend a long time underwater between breaths. Air is forced from the lungs during a dive and into the upper respiratory passages, where gases cannot easily be absorbed into the bloodstream. This helps protect the seal from the bends. The middle ear is also lined with blood sinuses that inflate during diving, helping to maintain a constant pressure.\nPhocids are more specialized for aquatic life than otariids. They lack external ears and have sleek, streamlined bodies. Retractable nipples, internal testicles, and an internal penile sheath provide further streamlining. A smooth layer of blubber lies underneath the skin. Phocids are able to divert blood flow to this layer to help control their temperatures.\nCommunication.\nUnlike otariids, true seals do not communicate by 'barking'. Instead, they communicate by slapping the water and grunting.\nReproduction.\nPhocids spend most of their time at sea, although they return to land or pack ice to breed and give birth. Pregnant females spend long periods foraging at sea, building up fat reserves, and then return to the breeding site to use their stored energy to nurse pups. However, the common seal displays a reproductive strategy similar to that used by otariids, in which the mother makes short foraging trips between nursing bouts.\nBecause a phocid mother's feeding grounds are often hundreds of kilometers from the breeding site, she must fast while lactating. This combination of fasting with lactation requires the mother to provide large amounts of energy to her pup at a time when she is not eating (and often, not drinking). Mothers must supply their own metabolic needs while nursing. This is a miniature version of the humpback whales' strategy, which involves fasting during their months-long migration from arctic feeding areas to tropical breeding/nursing areas and back.\nPhocids produce thick, fat-rich milk that allows them to provide their pups with large amounts of energy in a short period. This allows the mother to return to the sea in time to replenish her reserves. Lactation ranges from five to seven weeks in the monk seal to just three to five days in the hooded seal. The mother ends nursing by leaving her pup at the breeding site to search for food (pups continue to nurse if given the opportunity). \"Milk stealers\" that suckle from unrelated, sleeping females are not uncommon; this often results in the death of the mother's pup, since a female can only feed one pup.\nGrowth and maturation.\nThe pup's diet is so high in calories that it builds up a fat store. Before the pup is ready to forage, the mother abandons it, and the pup consumes its own fat for weeks or even months while it matures. Seals, like all marine mammals, need time to develop the oxygen stores, swimming muscles, and neural pathways necessary for effective diving and foraging. Seal pups typically eat no food and drink no water during the period, although some polar species eat snow. The postweaning fast ranges from two weeks in the hooded seal to 9\u201312 weeks in the northern elephant seal. The physiological and behavioral adaptations that allow phocid pups to endure these remarkable fasts, which are among the longest for any mammal, remain an area of active study and research.\nFeeding strategy.\nPhocids make use of at least four different feeding strategies: suction feeding, grip and tear feeding, filter feeding, and pierce feeding. Each of these feeding strategies is aided by a specialized skull, mandible, and tooth morphology. However, despite morphological specialization, most phocids are opportunistic and employ multiple strategies to capture and eat prey. For example, the leopard seal, \"Hydrurga leptonyx\", uses grip and tear feeding to prey on penguins, suction feeding to consume small fish, and filter feeding to catch krill."}

A person who commits espionage is called an espionage agent or spy. Any individual or spy ring (a cooperating group of spies), in the service of a government, company, criminal organization, or independent operation, can commit espionage. The practice is clandestine, as it is by definition unwelcome. In some circumstances, it may be a legal tool of law enforcement and in others, it may be illegal and punishable by law.\nEspionage is often part of an institutional effort by a government or commercial concern. However, the term tends to be associated with state spying on potential or actual enemies for military purposes. Spying involving corporations is known as industrial espionage.\nOne way to gather data and information about a targeted organization is by infiltrating its ranks. Spies can then return information such as the size and strength of enemy forces. They can also find dissidents within the organization and influence them to provide further information or to defect. In times of crisis, spies steal technology and sabotage the enemy in various ways. Counterintelligence is the practice of thwarting enemy espionage and intelligence-gathering. Almost all sovereign states have strict laws concerning espionage, including those who practice espionage in other countries, and the penalties for being caught are often severe.\nHistory.\nEspionage has been recognized as of importance in military affairs since ancient times.\nThe oldest known classified document was a report made by a spy disguised as a diplomatic envoy in the court of King Hammurabi, who died in around 1750 BC. The ancient Egyptians had a developed secret service, and espionage is mentioned in the \"Iliad\", the Bible, and the Amarna letters. Espionage was also prevalent in the Greco-Roman world, when spies employed illiterate subjects in civil services.\nThe thesis that espionage and intelligence has a central role in war as well as peace was first advanced in \"The Art of War\" and in the \"Arthashastra\". In the Middle Ages European states excelled at what has later been termed counter-subversion when Catholic inquisitions were staged to annihilate heresy. Inquisitions were marked by centrally organised mass interrogations and detailed record keeping. Western espionage changed fundamentally during the Renaissance when Italian city-states installed resident ambassadors in capital cities to collect intelligence. Renaissance Venice became so obsessed with espionage that the Council of Ten, which was nominally responsible for security, did not even allow the doge to consult government archives freely. In 1481 the Council of Ten barred all Venetian government officials from making contact with ambassadors or foreigners. Those revealing official secrets could face the death penalty. Venice became obsessed with espionage because successful international trade demanded that the city-state could protect its trade secrets. Under Queen Elizabeth I of England (), Francis Walsingham (\u20091532\u20131590) was appointed foreign secretary and intelligence chief. The novelist and journalist Daniel Defoe (died 1731) not only spied for the British government, but also developed a theory of espionage foreshadowing modern police-state methods.\nDuring the American Revolution, Nathan Hale and Benedict Arnold achieved their fame as spies, and there was considerable use of spies on both sides during the American Civil War. Though not a spy himself, George Washington was America's first spymaster, utilizing espionage tactics against the British.\nIn the 20th century, at the height of World War I, all great powers except the United States had elaborate civilian espionage systems, and all national military establishments had intelligence units. In order to protect the country against foreign agents, the U.S. Congress passed the Espionage Act of 1917. Mata Hari, who obtained information for Germany by seducing French officials, was the most noted espionage agent of World War I. Prior to World War II, Germany and Imperial Japan established elaborate espionage nets. In 1942 the Office of Strategic Services was founded by Gen. William J. Donovan. However, the British system was the keystone of Allied intelligence. Numerous resistance groups such as the Austrian Maier-Messner Group, the French Resistance, the Witte Brigade, Milorg and the Polish Home Army worked against Nazi Germany and provided the Allied secret services with information that was very important for the war effort.\nSince the end of World War II, the activity of espionage has enlarged, much of it growing out of the Cold War between the United States and the former USSR. The Russian Empire and its successor, the Soviet Union, have had a long tradition of espionage ranging from the Okhrana to the KGB (Committee for State Security), which also acted as a secret police force. In the United States, the 1947 National Security Act created the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to coordinate intelligence and the National Security Agency for research into codes and electronic communication. In addition to these, the United States has 13 other intelligence gathering agencies; most of the U.S. expenditures for intelligence gathering are budgeted to various Defense Dept. agencies and their programs. Under the intelligence reorganization of 2004, the director of national intelligence is responsible for overseeing and coordinating the activities and budgets of the U.S. intelligence agencies.\nIn the Cold War, espionage cases included Alger Hiss, Whittaker Chambers and the Rosenberg Case. In 1952 the Communist Chinese captured two CIA agents and in 1960 Francis Gary Powers, flying a U-2 reconnaissance mission over the Soviet Union for the CIA, was shot down and captured. During the Cold War, many Soviet intelligence officials defected to the West, including Gen. Walter Krivitsky, Victor Kravchenko, Vladimir Petrov, Peter Deriabin, Pawel Monat and Oleg Penkovsky of the GRU. Among Western officials who defected to the Soviet Union are Guy Burgess and Donald D. Maclean of Great Britain in 1951, Otto John of West Germany in 1954, William H. Martin and Bernon F. Mitchell, U.S. cryptographers, in 1960, and Harold (Kim) Philby of Great Britain in 1962. U.S. acknowledgment of its U-2 flights and the exchange of Francis Gary Powers for Rudolf Abel in 1962 implied the legitimacy of some espionage as an arm of foreign policy.\nChina has a very cost-effective intelligence program that is especially effective in monitoring neighboring countries such as Mongolia, Russia and India. Smaller countries can also mount effective and focused espionage efforts. For instance, the Vietnamese communists had consistently superior intelligence during the Vietnam War. Some Islamic countries, including Libya, Iran and Syria, have highly developed operations as well. SAVAK, the secret police of the Pahlavi dynasty, was particularly feared by Iranian dissidents before the 1979 Iranian Revolution.\nModern day.\nToday, spy agencies target the illegal drug trade and terrorists as well as state actors.\nIntelligence services value certain intelligence collection techniques over others. The former Soviet Union, for example, preferred human sources over research in open sources, while the United States has tended to emphasize technological methods such as SIGINT and IMINT. In the Soviet Union, both political (KGB) and military intelligence (GRU) officers were judged by the number of agents they recruited.\nTargets of espionage.\nEspionage agents are usually trained experts in a targeted field so they can differentiate mundane information from targets of value to their own organizational development. Correct identification of the target at its execution is the sole purpose of the espionage operation.\nBroad areas of espionage targeting expertise include:\nMethods and terminology.\nAlthough the news media may speak of \"spy satellites\" and the like, espionage is not a synonym for all intelligence-gathering disciplines. It is a specific form of human source intelligence (HUMINT). Codebreaking (cryptanalysis or COMINT), aircraft or satellite photography (IMINT), and analysis of publicly available data sources (OSINT) are all intelligence gathering disciplines, but none of them is considered espionage. Many HUMINT activities, such as prisoner interrogation, reports from military reconnaissance patrols and from diplomats, etc., are not considered espionage. Espionage is the disclosure of sensitive information (classified) to people who are not cleared for that information or access to that sensitive information.\nUnlike other forms of intelligence collection disciplines, espionage usually involves accessing the place where the desired information is stored or accessing the people who know the information and will divulge it through some kind of subterfuge. There are exceptions to physical meetings, such as the Oslo Report, or the insistence of Robert Hanssen in never meeting the people who bought his information.\nThe US defines espionage towards itself as \"the act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving information about the national defence with an intent, or reason to believe, that the information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation\". \"Black's Law Dictionary\" (1990) defines espionage as: \"...\u00a0gathering, transmitting, or losing\u00a0... information related to the national defense\". Espionage is a violation of United States law, and Article 106a of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The United States, like most nations, conducts espionage against other nations, under the control of the National Clandestine Service. Britain's espionage activities are controlled by the Secret Intelligence Service.\nTechnology and techniques.\nSource:\nOrganization.\nA spy is a person employed to seek out secret information from a source. Within the United States Intelligence Community, \"asset\" is more common usage. A case officer or Special Agent, who may have diplomatic status (i.e., official cover or non-official cover), supports and directs the human collector. Cut-outs are couriers who do not know the agent or case officer but transfer messages. A safe house is a refuge for spies. Spies often seek to obtain secret information from another source.\nIn larger networks, the organization can be complex with many methods to avoid detection, including clandestine cell systems. Often the players have never met. Case officers are stationed in foreign countries to recruit and supervise intelligence agents, who in turn spy on targets in the countries where they are assigned. A spy need not be a citizen of the target country and hence does not automatically commit treason when operating within it. While the more common practice is to recruit a person already trusted with access to sensitive information, sometimes a person with a well-prepared synthetic identity (cover background), called a \"legend\" in tradecraft, may attempt to infiltrate a target organization.\nThese agents can be moles (who are recruited before they get access to secrets), defectors (who are recruited after they get access to secrets and leave their country) or defectors in place (who get access but do not leave).\nA \"legend\" is also employed for an individual who is not an illegal agent, but is an ordinary citizen who is \"relocated\", for example, a \"protected witness\". Nevertheless, such a non-agent very likely will also have a case officer who will act as a controller. As in most, if not all synthetic identity schemes, for whatever purpose (illegal or legal), the assistance of a controller is required.\nSpies may also be used to spread disinformation in the organization in which they are planted, such as giving false reports about their country's military movements, or about a competing company's ability to bring a product to market. Spies may be given other roles that also require infiltration, such as sabotage.\nMany governments spy on their allies as well as their enemies, although they typically maintain a policy of not commenting on this. Governments also employ private companies to collect information on their behalf such as SCG International Risk, International Intelligence Limited and others.\nMany organizations, both national and non-national, conduct espionage operations. It should not be assumed that espionage is always directed at the most secret operations of a target country. National and terrorist organizations and other groups are also targeted. This is because governments want to retrieve information that they can use to be proactive in protecting their nation from potential terrorist attacks.\nCommunications both are necessary to espionage and clandestine operations, and also a great vulnerability when the adversary has sophisticated SIGINT detection and interception capability. Spies rely on COVCOM or covert communication through technically advanced spy devices. Agents must also transfer money securely.\nIndustrial espionage.\nReportedly Canada is losing $12 billion and German companies are estimated to be losing about \u20ac50 billion ($87 billion) and 30,000 jobs to industrial espionage every year.\nAgents in espionage.\nIn espionage jargon, an \"agent\" is the person who does the spying. They may be a citizen of a country recruited by that country to spy on another; a citizen of a country recruited by that country to carry out false flag assignments disrupting his own country; a citizen of one country who is recruited by a second country to spy on or work against his own country or a third country, and more.\nIn popular usage, this term is sometimes confused with an \"intelligence officer\", \"intelligence operative\", or \"case officer\" who recruits and handles agents.\nAmong the most common forms of agent are:\nLess common or lesser known forms of agent include:\nLaw.\nEspionage against a nation is a crime under the legal code of many nations. In the United States, it is covered by the Espionage Act of 1917. The risks of espionage vary. A spy violating the host country's laws may be deported, imprisoned, or even executed. A spy violating its own country's laws can be imprisoned for espionage or/and treason (which in the United States and some other jurisdictions can only occur if they take up arms or aids the enemy against their own country during wartime), or even executed, as the Rosenbergs were. For example, when Aldrich Ames handed a stack of dossiers of U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agents in the Eastern Bloc to his KGB-officer \"handler\", the KGB \"rolled up\" several networks, and at least ten people were secretly shot. When Ames was arrested by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), he faced life in prison; his contact, who had diplomatic immunity, was declared \"persona non grata\" and taken to the airport. Ames' wife was threatened with life imprisonment if her husband did not cooperate; he did, and she was given a five-year sentence. Hugh Francis Redmond, a CIA officer in China, spent nineteen years in a Chinese prison for espionage\u2014and died there\u2014as he was operating without diplomatic cover and immunity.\nIn United States law, treason, espionage, and spying are separate crimes. Treason and espionage have graduated punishment levels.\nThe United States in World War I passed the Espionage Act of 1917. Over the years, many spies, such as the Soble spy ring, Robert Lee Johnson, the Rosenberg ring, Aldrich Hazen Ames, Robert Philip Hanssen, Jonathan Pollard, John Anthony Walker, James Hall III, and others have been prosecuted under this law.\nHistory of espionage laws.\nFrom ancient times, the penalty for espionage in many countries was execution. This was true right up until the era of World War II; for example, Josef Jakobs was a Nazi spy who parachuted into Great Britain in 1941 and was executed for espionage.\nIn modern times, many people convicted of espionage have been given penal sentences rather than execution. For example, Aldrich Hazen Ames is an American CIA analyst, turned KGB mole, who was convicted of espionage in 1994; he is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole in the high-security Allenwood U.S. Penitentiary. Ames was formerly a 31-year CIA counterintelligence officer and analyst who committed espionage against his country by spying for the Soviet Union and Russia. So far as it is known, Ames compromised the second-largest number of CIA agents, second only to Robert Hanssen, who also served a prison sentence until his death in 2023.\nUse against non-spies.\nEspionage laws are also used to prosecute non-spies. In the United States, the Espionage Act of 1917 was used against socialist politician Eugene V. Debs (at that time the Act had much stricter guidelines and amongst other things banned speech against military recruiting). The law was later used to suppress publication of periodicals, for example of Father Coughlin in World War II. In the early 21st century, the act was used to prosecute whistleblowers such as Thomas Andrews Drake, John Kiriakou, and Edward Snowden, as well as officials who communicated with journalists for innocuous reasons, such as Stephen Jin-Woo Kim.\n, India and Pakistan were holding several hundred prisoners of each other's country for minor violations like trespass or visa overstay, often with accusations of espionage attached. Some of these include cases where Pakistan and India both deny citizenship to these people, leaving them stateless. The BBC reported in 2012 on one such case, that of Mohammed Idrees, who was held under Indian police control for approximately 13 years for overstaying his 15-day visa by 2\u20133 days after seeing his ill parents in 1999. Much of the 13 years were spent in prison waiting for a hearing, and more time was spent homeless or living with generous families. The Indian People's Union for Civil Liberties and Human Rights Law Network both decried his treatment. The BBC attributed some of the problems to tensions caused by the Kashmir conflict.\nEspionage laws in the UK.\nEspionage is illegal in the UK under the National Security Act 2023, which repealed prior Official Secrets Acts and creates three separate offences for espionage. A person is liable to be imprisoned for life for committing an offence under Section 1 of the Act, or 14 years for an offence under Sections 2 and 3\nGovernment intelligence laws and its distinction from espionage.\nGovernment intelligence is very much distinct from espionage, and is not illegal in the UK, providing that the organisations of individuals are registered, often with the ICO, and are acting within the restrictions of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA). 'Intelligence' is considered legally as \"information of all sorts gathered by a government or organisation to guide its decisions. It includes information that may be both public and private, obtained from much different public or secret sources. It could consist entirely of information from either publicly available or secret sources, or be a combination of the two.\"\nHowever, espionage and intelligence can be linked. According to the MI5 website, \"foreign intelligence officers acting in the UK under diplomatic cover may enjoy immunity from prosecution. Such persons can only be tried for spying (or, indeed, any criminal offence) if diplomatic immunity is waived beforehand. Those officers operating without diplomatic cover have no such immunity from prosecution\".\nThere are also laws surrounding government and organisational intelligence and surveillance. Generally, the body involved should be issued with some form of warrant or permission from the government and should be enacting their procedures in the interest of protecting national security or the safety of public citizens. Those carrying out intelligence missions should act within not only RIPA but also the Data Protection Act and Human Rights Act. However, there are spy equipment laws and legal requirements around intelligence methods that vary for each form of intelligence enacted.\nWar.\nIn war, espionage is considered permissible as many nations recognize the inevitability of opposing sides seeking intelligence each about the dispositions of the other. To make the mission easier and successful, combatants wear disguises to conceal their true identity from the enemy while penetrating enemy lines for intelligence gathering. However, if they are caught behind enemy lines in disguises, they are not entitled to prisoner-of-war status and subject to prosecution and punishment\u2014including execution.\nThe Hague Convention of 1907 addresses the status of wartime spies, specifically within \"Laws and Customs of War on Land\" (Hague IV); October 18, 1907: Chapter II Spies\". Article 29 states that a person is considered a spy who, acts clandestinely or on false pretences, infiltrates enemy lines with the intention of acquiring intelligence about the enemy and communicate it to the belligerent during times of war. Soldiers who penetrate enemy lines in proper uniforms for the purpose of acquiring intelligence are not considered spies but are lawful combatants entitled to be treated as prisoners of war upon capture by the enemy. Article 30 states that a spy captured behind enemy lines may only be punished following a trial. However, Article 31 provides that if a spy successfully rejoined his own military and is then captured by the enemy as a lawful combatant, he cannot be punished for his previous acts of espionage and must be treated as a prisoner of war. This provision does not apply to citizens who committed treason against their own country or co-belligerents of that country and may be captured and prosecuted at any place or any time regardless whether he rejoined the military to which he belongs or not or during or after the war.\nThe ones that are excluded from being treated as spies while behind enemy lines are escaping prisoners of war and downed airmen as international law distinguishes between a disguised spy and a disguised escaper. It is permissible for these groups to wear enemy uniforms or civilian clothes in order to facilitate their escape back to friendly lines so long as they do not attack enemy forces, collect military intelligence, or engage in similar military operations while so disguised. Soldiers who are wearing enemy uniforms or civilian clothes simply for the sake of warmth along with other purposes rather than engaging in espionage or similar military operations while so attired are also excluded from being treated as unlawful combatants.\nSaboteurs are treated as spies as they too wear disguises behind enemy lines for the purpose of waging destruction on an enemy's vital targets in addition to intelligence gathering. For example, during World War II, eight German agents entered the U.S. in June 1942 as part of Operation Pastorius, a sabotage mission against U.S. economic targets. Two weeks later, all were arrested in civilian clothes by the FBI thanks to two German agents betraying the mission to the U.S. Under the Hague Convention of 1907, these Germans were classified as spies and tried by a military tribunal in Washington D.C. On August 3, 1942, all eight were found guilty and sentenced to death. Five days later, six were executed by electric chair at the District of Columbia jail. Two who had given evidence against the others had their sentences reduced by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to prison terms. In 1948, they were released by President Harry S. Truman and deported to the American Zone of occupied Germany.\nThe U.S. codification of enemy spies is Article 106 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. This provides a mandatory death sentence if a person captured in the act is proven to be \"lurking as a spy or acting as a spy in or about any place, vessel, or aircraft, within the control or jurisdiction of any of the armed forces, or in or about any shipyard, any manufacturing or industrial plant, or any other place or institution engaged in work in aid of the prosecution of the war by the United States, or elsewhere\".\nSpy fiction.\nSpies have long been favorite topics for novelists and filmmakers. An early example of espionage literature is \"Kim\" by the English novelist Rudyard Kipling, with a description of the training of an intelligence agent in the Great Game between the UK and Russia in 19th century Central Asia. An even earlier work was James Fenimore Cooper's classic novel, \"The Spy,\" written in 1821, about an American spy in New York during the Revolutionary War.\nDuring the many 20th-century spy scandals, much information became publicly known about national spy agencies and dozens of real-life secret agents. These sensational stories piqued public interest in a profession largely off-limits to human interest news reporting, a natural consequence of the secrecy inherent in their work. To fill in the blanks, the popular conception of the secret agent has been formed largely by 20th and 21st-century fiction and film. Attractive and sociable real-life agents such as Valerie Plame find little employment in serious fiction, however. The fictional secret agent is more often a loner, sometimes amoral\u2014an existential hero operating outside the everyday constraints of society. Loner spy personalities may have been a stereotype of convenience for authors who already knew how to write loner private investigator characters that sold well from the 1920s to the present.\nJohnny Fedora achieved popularity as a fictional agent of early Cold War espionage, but James Bond is the most commercially successful of the many spy characters created by intelligence insiders during that struggle. Other fictional agents include Le Carr\u00e9's George Smiley, and Harry Palmer as played by Michael Caine.\nJumping on the spy bandwagon, other writers also started writing about spy fiction featuring female spies as protagonists, such as \"The Baroness\", which has more graphic action and sex, as compared to other novels featuring male protagonists.\nSpy fiction has permeated the video game world as well, in games such as \"Perfect Dark\", \"GoldenEye 007\", \"\", \"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell\" and the \"Metal Gear\" series.\nEspionage has also made its way into comedy depictions. The 1960s TV series \"Get Smart\", the 1983 Finnish film \"Agent 000 and the Deadly Curves\", and \"Johnny English\" film trilogy portrays an inept spy, while the 1985 movie \"Spies Like Us\" depicts a pair of none-too-bright men sent to the Soviet Union to investigate a missile.\nThe historical novel \"The Emperor and the Spy\" highlights the adventurous life of U.S. Colonel Sidney Forrester Mashbir, who during the 1920s and 1930s attempted to prevent war with Japan, and when war did erupt, he became General MacArthur's top advisor in the Pacific Theater of World War Two.\nBlack Widow is also a fictional agent who was introduced as a Russian spy, an antagonist of the superhero Iron Man. She later became an agent of the fictional spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. and a member of the superhero team the Avengers."}

They were released as shareware titles for Macintosh and Windows systems. \"Exile III\" was also ported to Linux by a third party. There were four games released in the series. All of the games were later revived in the \"Avernum\" series. Common to all games in the \"Exile\" series are 2D graphics and basic sound. The graphics in the first versions of \"Exile I\" and \"II\" had simple textures, colours and outlines, which were then replaced in later versions with \"Exile III\"s graphics. The games are designed to be non-linear and long in gameplay length.\nGameplay.\nIn each game, the player is required to create six characters to form a party of adventurers or may instead use a default party. The characters' general, combat, magic and miscellaneous skills can be customized along with the character names and graphics. From \"Exile II\" onward, characters can have their traits and race configured.\nThe games have three modes including Outdoor Mode, Town Mode and Combat Mode. In Outdoor Mode, the party can enter a town, engage a group of enemies in Combat Mode and rest (if the party has food). In Town Mode, the party can talk to people, purchase from shops (provided they have enough gold), train the characters (provided they have sufficient gold and skill points), find sub-quests, pick up items (from \"Exile 2\" onward, items can be stolen) and enter Combat Mode. In Combat Mode, the party can attack enemies, defend themselves and pick up adjacent items. Combat Mode can be ended at any time in towns, but can only end outdoors when all enemies are killed.\nMagic is divided into Mage and Priest spell types. Spells for attacking can only be cast in Combat Mode. Some spells, such as Light spells, can be cast at any time. Other spells can only be cast outdoors or in town when not in Combat Mode. Players can create a character equipped with spells up to level 3, but higher level or certain spells must be purchased or found in special encounters.\nGames.\n\"Exile I: Escape from the Pit\".\nThe first game of the \"Exile\" trilogy released in January 1995 sees a party of newly created characters thrown from the world above into the subterranean world known as Exile. Once here, the party discovers a civilization formed from the outcasts of the Empire above, a culture beset by constant warfare and monsters galore. The party meets with many of those who wish to get revenge on the Empire for the wrongs it has done to the peoples of Exile.\nThe characters become a rallying point around which the people of Exile who desire vengeance gather to focus their energies into finding a way to strike back against the cruel Emperor of the surface. Together, the party manages to assassinate Emperor Hawthorne in his throne room, banish the demon king Grah-hoth who was becoming a significant threat to the citizens of Exile, and secure an escape route to the surface.\n\"Exile II: Crystal Souls\".\nThe second \"Exile\" game follows directly from the first, released in November 1996. The Empire has begun to recognise the threat the Exiles pose and begin sending their army down into Exile in huge numbers. To make matters worse, unknown barriers of energy are sprouting up around the world \u2013 sometimes aiding the Exiles, sometimes helping the Empire who can afford the losses much more easily than the Exiles.\nA new party of characters meets one of the creatures causing the barriers sprouting up in Exile and go to meet with the unknown race to negotiate. In the end, the party is more successful - and the Vahnatai joins with the Exiles to drive out the Empire. With the support of the Vahnatai the Exiles turn the tables on the Empire and successfully repulse their invasion.\n\"Exile III: Ruined World\".\nThe final release in the \"Exile\" trilogy takes place some time after \"Exile II\", released in January 1997. The Linux version was ported by Boutell.com in Summer, 2000. A lot of preparation has taken place and now the Exiles are ready to send a selected few back into the light of the surface. However, while the members of the expedition are at first stunned by the sheer beauty of the land around them, they begin to notice that things are not as perfect as they seem. The slimes the party encounters are only the first part of what becomes a series of monsters and terrible occurrences that are blighting the Empire and laying it to waste.\nWhile scouting the land, as were the expedition members' orders from the nation of Exile, the members are asked by the Empire to help save the surface from its blight. They bring the Exiles and the Empire together as allies trying to find the cause of the destruction.\n\"Blades of Exile\".\n\"Blades of Exile\" was released in December 1997, consisting of three short scenarios set after the main trilogy as well as an editor that allows players to create their own scenarios, which need not be set in the \"Exile\" game world at all. Several hundred custom-made scenarios have been designed since the release of the game in 1997. The most prominent meeting places on the web of the \"Blades of Exile\" community are the official company-hosted internet forum. These forums offer support for beginning designers and players, reviews of new scenarios and general discussions about the use of the scenario editor. In June 2007, Jeff Vogel released the source code and game content for \"Blades of Exile\", which is currently under version 2 of the GNU General Public License.\nRelease.\nOn December 1, 1998, the first three \"Exile\" games also came packaged on a CD called the \"Exile Trilogy CD\". As of July 8, 2013, these games are freeware on Spiderweb Software's website.\nReception.\nReviews described the \"Exile\" trilogy as a \"throwback\" to old fashioned role-playing games, with deep, complex gameplay and simplistic graphics. \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\" rated \"Exile: Escape from the Pit\" three and a half out of five stars, calling it \"one of the year's best shareware games.\" The reviewer dropped a half star for its \"primitive graphics\" but found the game addictive and recommended it to veteran players \"hungry for good, old fashioned fantasy role-playing games\". \"Inside Mac Games\" rated \"Exile\" four out of five, calling it an Ultima-style role-playing game that required \"patience and thoroughness\" and had slightly \"cheesy\" graphics and sound. \"Inside Mac Games\" named \"Exile\" as runner up to \"\" for the best role-playing game of 1996.\n\"Inside Mac Games\" awarded \"Exile II\" 4 out 5 and said that it carried on \"Exile\" tradition as \"truly a high quality Shareware game\". A subsequent \"Inside Mac Games\" review said \"Exile II: Crystal Souls\" had \"a size, scope and depth of plot unmatched in Macintosh role-playing games.\" \"Exile II: Crystal Souls\" was an honorable mention for \"MacUser\"s award for the best shareware game of 1996, behind winner \"Escape Velocity\". \n\"Computer Gaming World\" said that \"Exile III: Ruined World\" appears at first to be \"a shareware game with primitive graphics\" but reveals itself to be a \"remarkably deep\" traditional role-playing game with deceptive complexity. The reviewer praised the \"well written and witty\" NPC dialogue and elegant interface. Emil Pagliarulo reviewed \"Exile III\" positively for the \"Adrenaline Vault\", rating the game four out of five stars and calling it an \"engrossing, thoroughly entertaining [...] epic computer role-playing game\" with simplistic presentation and \"enormous depth\". \"Inside Mac Games\" rated \"Exile III\" 4 out of 5, saying that despite superficial similarities to previous games in the series, \"enough new features, situations and challenges\" would keep newcomers and veterans interested. The review concluded that \"Exile III\" was \"more of the same old thing: inexpensive, challenging, interesting, exciting and entertaining.\" \"Inside Mac Games\" called \"Exile III\" \"huge\" and \"highly detailed\", with quality graphics, \"an elegant interface\", and \"one of the largest and most detailed worlds and plots a fantasy role-playing game has offered\". \"Exile III\" received the 1998 ZDNet Shareware Game of the Year award, selected by the editors of Ziff-Davis magazines \"FamilyPC\", \"PC Magazine\", and \"Computer Gaming World\".\n\"Inside Mac Games\" awarded \"Blades of Exile\" 3 out of 5, calling it \"a nice, solid CRPG\" that offered value for money and ran bug-free. The reviewer found the introductory scenario lacking in story, with too much repetitive combat and \"plot-checks that have the potential to really aggravate\".\n\"Avernum\".\nSpiderweb Software has remade the \"Exile\" trilogy twice. The games were remade in 2000\u20132002 as the ' of the \"Avernum\" series, which replaced the two-dimensional tile-based graphics system of \"Exile\" with an isometric one and made numerous changes to the RPG system and some changes to the content. The remakes were followed by a remake of \"Blades of Exile\", \"Blades of Avernum\", in 2004. The \"Exile\" trilogy was rebooted for a second time with the release of ' (2011), ' (2015), and ' (2018); the remakes featured an enhanced game engine and expanded storylines.\nEngine and interface.\nWhile the game engine itself remained relatively similar between all games in the series, the interface went through many changes. Each iteration sported a new layout and color scheme, as well the individual elements, like the inventory and character roster boxes, were also changed to display information differently. Between \"Exile I\" and \"Exile II\" the most notable difference is a background color change as well as a change to the border of the play window. Between \"Exile II\" and \"Exile III\" the interface was changed significantly in that the colors and window styles were changed again but the player roster was overhauled and an inventory window was added. The changes between \"Exile III\" and \"Blades of Exile\" were more subtle and were again of the color and style nature."}

The prince's mother was Fujiwara no Kaneko/\"Kaishi\" (\u85e4\u539f\u61d0\u5b50), who was a daughter of \"sessh\u014d\" Fujiwara no Koretada. Morasada was also the brother of Emperor Sanj\u014d.\nEvents of Kazan's life.\nPrince Morasada was seventeen years of age at the time of the succession.\nHe commissioned the Sh\u016bi Wakash\u016b.\nHe faced a tough political struggle from the Fujiwara family; and at the age of nineteen, he was manipulated into abandoning the throne by Fujiwara no Kaneie. Kaneie told him that Ichijo (Kaneie's maternal grandson) already held the Regalia, and that there was no purpose in Kazan continuing to rule. Under some pressure, Kazan acquiesced, and went to the Gangy\u014d-ji temple. He was accompanied by Kaneie's second son, Michikane, who was also to enter religion. When they arrived, however, Michikane said he would like to see his parents one final time while he was still a layman. Michikane never came back.\nNy\u016bkaku went on various pilgrimages and 're-founded' the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage, which was established in the early 8th century by a monk to the name of Tokudo Shonin. This pilgrimage involves travelling to 33 locations across the eight provinces of the Western Japan.\nSome scholars doubt that Kazan, in his unstable mental condition at the time was involved with the founding of the pilgrimage, thereby leaving all of the credit to Shonin.\nIt is suggested by many scholars that the mental health of Kazan, particularly in later life, was not stable; and therefore, living as a monk may have caused deteriorating behavior.\n\"Daij\u014d-tenn\u014d\" Kazan died at the age of 41 on the 8th day of the 2nd month of the fifth year of \"Kank\u014d\" (1008).\nThe actual site of Kazan's grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Kyoto.\nThe Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Kazan's mausoleum. It is formally named \"Kamiya no hotori no misasagi\".\nHe is buried amongst the \"Seven Imperial Tombs\" at Ry\u014dan-ji Temple in Kyoto. The mound which commemorates the Hosokawa Emperor Kazan is today named \"Kinugasa-yama.\" The emperor's burial place would have been quite humble in the period after Kazan died.

According to \"Rolling Stone\", Costello \"reinvigorated the literate, lyrical traditions of Bob Dylan and Van Morrison with the raw energy and sass that were principal ethics of punk\", noting the \"construction of his songs, which set densely layered wordplay in an ever-expanding repertoire of styles.\" His first album, \"My Aim Is True\" (1977), spawned no hit singles, but contains some of Costello's best-known songs, including the ballad \"Alison\". Costello's next two albums, \"This Year's Model\" (1978) and \"Armed Forces\" (1979), recorded with his backing band the Attractions, helped define the new wave genre. From late 1977 until early 1980, each of the eight singles he released reached the UK Top 30. His biggest hit single, \"Oliver's Army\" (1979), sold more than 500,000 copies in Britain. He has had more modest commercial success in the US, but has earned much critical praise. From 1977 until the early 2000s, Costello's albums regularly ranked high on the \"Village Voice\" Pazz &amp; Jop critics' poll, with \"This Year's Model\" and \"Imperial Bedroom\" (1982) voted the best album of their respective years. His biggest US hit single, \"Veronica\" (1989), reached number 19 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\nBorn into a musical family, Costello was raised with knowledge and appreciation of a wide range of musical styles and an insider's view of the music business. His opportunity to begin a professional career as a musician coincided with the rise of punk rock in England. The primitivism brought into fashion by punk led Costello to disguise his musical savvy at the beginning of his career, but his stylistic range has come to encompass R&amp;B, country, jazz, baroque pop, Tin Pan Alley and classical music. He has released album-length collaborations with the classical ensemble the Brodsky Quartet, the New Orleans R&amp;B songwriter and producer Allen Toussaint and the hip-hop group the Roots. Costello has written more than a dozen songs with Paul McCartney and had a long-running songwriting partnership with Burt Bacharach.\nCostello has had hits with covers of songs, including Sam &amp; Dave's \"I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down\", Jerry Chesnut's \"Good Year for the Roses\" and Charles Aznavour's \"She\". One of the songs he is best known for, \"(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding\", was written by Nick Lowe and recorded by Lowe's group Brinsley Schwarz in 1974, but remained obscure until Costello released his version in 1979. Costello's own songs have been recorded by artists including Linda Ronstadt, George Jones, Roy Orbison, Johnny Cash, Dave Edmunds, Chet Baker and Alison Krauss.\nCostello has won two Grammy awards, two Ivor Novello awards, four Edison awards, an MTV Video Music Award, a BAFTA award, an ASCAP Founders award and a Gemini award. In 2003, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2016, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. From 2008 to 2010, he hosted a television show, \"\", on which he interviewed other musicians. In 2015, he published a well-received memoir, \"Unfaithful Music &amp; Disappearing Ink\".\nEarly life.\nElvis Costello was born Declan Patrick MacManus, on 25 August 1954, at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, West London, the only child of a record shop worker and a jazz musician. Both parents were from the Liverpool area and had moved to London together a few years earlier. Costello's father was of Irish descent and a Catholic, while his mother is English and was raised a Congregationalist.\nFamily background.\nCostello's mother, Lillian MacManus (n\u00e9e Ablett, 1927\u20132021), was born and raised in Toxteth, Liverpool, the daughter of a gas-main layer and a mother who became increasingly disabled by rheumatoid arthritis as Lillian grew up. Responsible for caring for her younger brother and sick mother, Lillian left school at 13 and took the first of a series of jobs at music stores. After moving to London with her future husband Ross in 1951, she took a job in the record department in Selfridges department store and continued selling records through the 1960s. Even after she no longer worked selling records, Lillian maintained a keen interest in a wide variety of music, including the popular music of the day.\nCostello's father, Ross MacManus (1927\u20132011), was a professional trumpet player and singer, born and raised in Birkenhead, across the River Mersey from Liverpool. He began his career in music in the late 1940s, playing trumpet in bebop bands in Birkenhead and Liverpool. He segued to playing trumpet and singing in modern jazz bands after moving to London in 1951. By 1954, he was sufficiently well known for his son's birth to be announced in the \"New Musical Express\". From 1955 to 1968, he was a featured singer in Joe Loss Orchestra, one of Britain's most popular big bands. Ross had a solo cabaret act from 1969 through the 1990s, playing workingmen's social clubs in the North of England, Scotland, and Wales. Ross recorded for small record labels under a variety of aliases, including Day Costello \u2013 Costello being Ross's paternal grandmother's maiden name. He also recorded advertising jingles. In 1973, he sang the \"Secret Lemonade Drinker\" jingle featured in a series of advertisements for R. Whites, with Costello on backing vocals.\nRoss's father, Patrick Matthew McManus, known as Pat, was also a professional musician. Pat was raised in an orphanage from age eight, where he learned to play trumpet. He later played trumpet as an army bandsman, a ship's musician for the White Star Line, and an orchestra musician in music halls and in theaters showing silent films. Costello has said that Pat, being the first in the family to make a career in music, is the reason he himself is a musician.\nChildhood and early musical influences.\nCostello spent most of his childhood in Twickenham, in west London, before moving to Liverpool with his mother in 1970. Costello was raised Roman Catholic and served as an altar boy until he was 14.\nCostello's parents had separated by the time Costello was ten years old, after which he was raised by his mother. Ross continued to be a significant presence in Costello's life and the two remained close until Ross's death in 2011. Costello has said that a childhood spent watching his father work gave him an innate sense of how to be a musician but also an understanding that a career in music was a job like any other, requiring discipline and hard work.\nCostello's parents never insisted he take music lessons or otherwise pushed him to follow in the family business. Instead, they raised him in a home filled with music, encouraged his musical curiosity, and supported his efforts to find his own way toward a career in music. Lillian told journalists that she knew before he was born he would have a career in music and that she listened to a broad range of music while she was pregnant with him with the intention of giving him an early start in music appreciation.\nAs a young child, Costello's musical influences came from his parents' record collection, which encompassed a wide range of styles but centred on traditional pop and jazz. Ross's job with the Joe Loss Orchestra required him to sing many of the pop hits of the day for the band's weekly radio show. To learn these songs, Ross received demonstration copies of the original artists' records, which he brought home to rehearse. When Costello grew old enough to have an interest in the current pop hits, Ross began giving him five or six of these demonstration records per week. Costello has said, \"That's why I know so many songs.\"\nChief among Costello's early favourites among the hit-makers of the day were the Beatles. Costello has said that, having turned nine years old in 1963, he was exactly the right age to experience the full force of Beatles fandom as he grew up. He has described the Beatles as his biggest musical influence. Costello was also deeply impressed by the songs of his future collaborator Burt Bacharach, which he knew through the hits British artists Cilla Black and Dusty Springfield had with them.\nAs Costello grew into his teens, his favourites included British beat groups the Kinks, Small Faces and the Who, Jamaican rocksteady and reggae acts who were popular in Britain, and especially Motown artists, who he knew mainly through their British hit singles and through the Motown Chartbusters compilation series. By the time Costello reached his mid-teens, Joni Mitchell had become an important and enduring influence on him. When Costello moved to Liverpool, he found he did not enjoy much of the progressive rock that was popular with his peers, so, casting around for music he might like, he developed an interest in the Grateful Dead and other folk rock groups like the Byrds and the Band, and through them, country music.\nEducation and decision to pursue a career in music.\nCostello was a well-behaved if sometimes argumentative student, but not generally an academically outstanding one. Not having scored well enough on his eleven-plus exams to go on to grammar school, he attended Archbishop Myers secondary modern school in Hounslow and then a comprehensive school in Everton, Liverpool, for sixth form. Costello did, however, show an early talent for writing. His mother told a journalist that, when Costello was 11 years old, his school entered him into a writing contest held by \"The Times\" intended for people aged 16 to 25, for which he won a prize. As he finished secondary school, he earned one A-level, in English, despite having made a firm decision to pursue a career in music a few months earlier and putting little effort into his final months of school.\nAlthough he never had any alternative career plan, Costello had previously been reluctant to commit to a career in music, partly because his upbringing had made him aware of the potential pitfalls involved. The shock of witnessing a teenage friend's death in a traffic accident changed his mind. He would later write, \"Suddenly, everything but music seemed like a waste of precious time.\"\nCostello completed his formal education in 1972 and, still living at home with his mother, set out to find a job that would earn him a steady wage while he pursued a career in music. He soon took a job as a computer operator at the Midland Bank data centre, in the Merseyside town of Bootle, because, at \u00a320 a week, it paid slightly better than other unskilled work he felt he was qualified for. According to Costello, the job consisted of essentially manual labour such as mounting tape reels and loading punched cards. Because the job involved frequent periods of waiting for the mainframe computers to complete their tasks before beginning them on the next one, it gave Costello time to write songs while at work. Except for a few months in 1973 when he worked as a clerk at the Midland Bank Putney branch, he continued to work full-time as a computer operator until a few weeks before his first album was released in July 1977.\nMusic career.\n1969\u20131976: Pre-professional career.\nCostello began writing songs and teaching himself to play guitar by age 14. To test his songs in front of an audience, he performed them in folk clubs that permitted amateur musicians to perform unpaid. He played these clubs regularly in London and continued in similar clubs when he moved to Liverpool at age 16, although folk music venues that welcomed original songs were scarcer in Liverpool than in London. By 17, he was occasionally being paid a little money. On the eve of the release of his debut album in 1977, Costello told a journalist that by that time he had written hundreds of songs.\nRusty.\nAt the beginning of 1972, Costello was invited to join a folk-rock band called Rusty by the band's founder, an 18-year-old veteran of the Liverpool music scene named Allan Mayes. As other members left, Rusty soon became a duo, with Mayes and Costello singing and playing acoustic guitars. For a little over a year, Rusty played regularly in small venues like pubs, clubs, schools, and community centres, mostly in and around Liverpool, unpaid or for small amounts of money. In Mayes's estimation, Costello was already a talented songwriter, able to quickly write songs in a variety of styles, and could sing like Neil Young or Robbie Robertson. Mayes has said he introduced Costello to Brinsley Schwarz, a band that would be an important influence on him. While in Rusty, Costello wrote an early version of a song he would record in 1980 as \"Ghost Train\", although by then little remained of the Rusty version except the central narrative idea of a married double act making their way through the low end of show business. In 2022, Costello reunited with Mayes to record and release an EP called \"The Resurrection of Rust\". The EP contained songs that were typical of Rusty's shows in 1972, including the early version of \"Ghost Train\", then called \"Maureen and Sam\".\nDeclan Costello.\nBy early 1973, Costello had determined that the music scene in Liverpool was too small to support his ambition to have a career in music, so he arranged to transfer from his job as a computer operator in the Midland Bank data centre in Bootle to a position as a clerk at the bank's Putney branch. Returning to London, Costello moved into the same Twickenham flat where he had lived with his mother a few years earlier, by then occupied by his father (Ross), Ross's second wife, and their infant son. When booking himself into London clubs, he began using the name Declan Costello, adopting a family name that Ross had once made a record under, because it was easier to spell and understand than MacManus when he spoke on the phone. Around this time, Costello accompanied Ross to Costello's first professional recording session, for the R. White's \"Secret Lemonade Drinker\" commercial jingle. Ross sang the lead vocal while Costello played guitar and sang backing vocals.\nFlip City.\nIn the second half of 1973, Costello formed a band called Flip City with several slightly older men who, like him, were fans of Brinsley Schwarz and other pub rock bands. The members of Flip City also shared Costello's enthusiasm for The Band, the Grateful Dead, and Clover. For most of 1974, Costello shared a rented house in southwest London with some of his bandmates. Flip City played the London pub rock circuit until the end of 1975, occasionally opening for more prominent bands such as Dr. Feelgood, but generally making little money and attracting little notice. Flip City's performances consisted of a mix of Costello's original songs and covers of rock, R&amp;B, and country songs. Their repertoire of Costello originals included early versions of songs that would appear on his first two albums as \"Pay It Back\", \"Miracle Man\", \"Living in Paradise\", and \"Radio Radio\". Costello wrote all but one of Flip City's original songs, did most of the singing, and chose the cover songs they played. A friend from those days later told a journalist, \"It wasn't so much that he imposed the ideas; he was the one who \"had\" the ideas.\" None of the other members of Flip City shared Costello's commitment to pursuing a career in music and some disapproved of his desire to make money from his music.\nCostello became engaged to marry a former schoolmate in late 1973. By then he had found a job as a computer operator at the Elizabeth Arden cosmetics factory in North Acton, in northwest London, similar to the one he had in Bootle and with similarly low wages. By early 1975, Costello was a husband and father and was struggling to support his family. Flip City's live engagements added little to his income, rarely paying more than the band's expenses.\nCostello recorded demos with Flip City at several sessions from mid-1974 until mid-1975, hoping to use them to get live bookings, secure a recording contract, or sell Costello's songs for other artists to record. All but the first of these sessions were at a small studio owned by Dave Robinson, future Stiff Records founder. Robinson later said that he thought Flip City \"could not play at all\" but Costello was talented and ought to \"find a real band.\"\nAfter Costello became successful, Flip City's demos were widely bootlegged, often misleadingly labelled to imply they were outtakes from the \"My Aim Is True\" sessions or otherwise affiliated with Stiff Records. The only Flip City recording to have been officially released is Costello's song \"Imagination (Is a Powerful Deceiver)\", recorded in early 1975, which appeared as a bonus track on the 1993 and 2001 reissues of \"My Aim Is True\". In the liner notes to the 2001 reissue, Costello wrote that, in retrospect, the song sounded to him like \"a very early attempt to write a song like 'Alison'.\"\nD.P. Costello.\nEven before disbanding Flip City in late 1975, Costello was writing songs he did not include in the band's repertoire. He recorded some of these as solo demos for Dave Robinson in mid-1975. For the next year, he shopped these and other solo demos to music publishers and record companies, hoping to be hired either as a songwriter or a recording artist. He sent out as many as 20 songs on a single tape to publishers, not yet realising that no publisher would have the patience to listen to so many songs. Sometimes he went to publishers' offices to perform his songs in person. None of this generated anything but rejections until he began creating \"show reels\" of no more than six of what he believed were his most attention-getting songs, selected to appeal to the recipient of each demo tape.\nBy February 1976, Costello was booking himself into clubs as a solo act under the name D.P. Costello, D.P. being his initials and a nickname he was sometimes called by his family. While working as D.P. Costello, he learned to sing and play guitar very loudly and developed a forceful stage presence, although he was still playing to small audiences for very little money. Few of the songs he had played with Flip City were included in these performances. Instead, he was debuting some of the songs that would start to get the attention of the music industry, such as \"Mystery Dance\" and \"Wave a White Flag\". Costello included both songs on a six-track demo tape he sent to London radio presenter Charlie Gillett, who thought \"Wave a White Flag\" was the best of the six. Gillett played several songs from the tape on his radio show later that year, the first time any Costello song received airplay.\nSometime in 1976, lack of money forced Costello, his wife and their toddler son to move in with relatives near Heathrow Airport, on the far west side of London. This meant Costello's commute to work in North Acton took him past the Hoover Building in Perivale. Around the same time, he was starting to become aware of the nascent punk movement, although he would not hear any of the British punk bands until they began releasing records. He was, however, inspired by the Modern Lovers' song \"Roadrunner\", with its reference to such quotidian landmarks as the Stop &amp; Shop, to write a song about the historical Art Deco building he rode past every day. Although he did not record it until 1980, Costello regarded this song, \"Hoover Factory\", as an artistic breakthrough. In the period just prior, he had been trying to imitate songwriters Randy Newman and John Prine. \"Hoover Factory\", he later recalled, got him \"through the door to a different, less ingratiating way of speaking\" in his songwriting. The next song he wrote was \"Radio Sweetheart\", which would become the B-side of his first single.\n1976\u20131977: \"My Aim Is True\".\nIn mid-August 1976, Costello included \"Mystery Dance\" and \"Radio Sweetheart\" on a demo tape he gave to Stiff Records, a new independent label that had just released its first single. Partly due to the airplay received from Gillett around the same time, Costello was soon evaluating offers from several record companies, including Gillett's own Oval Records. Costello chose to work with Stiff Records because they seemed prepared to move the fastest. Stiff had been founded by Jake Riviera, who managed several acts Costello admired, and Dave Robinson. Nick Lowe, whom Costello was on friendly terms with because he had attended so many performances by Lowe's band Brinsley Schwarz, was the label's first artist and soon became its in-house producer.\nFollowing a successful test-session in mid-September at Pathway Studios, an inexpensive studio in North London, Stiff agreed to finance more sessions for Costello with Clover, an American country-rock band from Marin County, California, as the backing band. Starting in late November or early December, Costello travelled to Headley Grange in East Hampshire, where Clover were living, to spend the day rehearsing and working out arrangements for a batch of his songs and then recording the songs with the band the next day at Pathway. Costello still held a full-time office job, so the sessions were spaced over several weeks to accommodate his work schedule and Stiff's tight finances. \"My Aim Is True\" was recorded and mixed in six four-hour sessions for a total cost of about \u00a31,000. The final mix was completed in late January 1977. Producer Nick Lowe, recording engineer Barry Farmer and Clover bassist John Ciambotti have all said they found Costello confident, well-prepared, and mature beyond his years during the making of the album.\nBy February 1977, Riviera and Robinson, who were now Costello's managers, had given him his new stage name, Elvis. The reference to Elvis Presley, who was still alive at the time, was simply intended to get attention. Costello neither particularly liked nor disliked Presley. Because Costello had seen his father, Ross, work under a variety of stage names, he gave little thought to the name change. Riviera and Robinson also helped give Costello a distinctive appearance that contrasted with the contemporaneous ideas how pop stars looked; they swapped the unobtrusive rimless glasses Costello had worn to correct astigmatism since he was a teenager for a pair with large black frames.\nCostello's first single, \"Less than Zero\", was released at the end of March 1977. It received a few brief, mixed reviews in the British music press and sold very few copies. Two further singles, \"Alison\" and \"(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes\", also sold poorly; the former would become one of his best-regarded and best-known songs. However, Costello was receiving increasingly prominent, positive coverage in the British music press.\n\"My Aim Is True\" had been completed since the end of January but its release was delayed, first because Stiff had wanted to release records by other artists who seemed more tied to transient music trends and then because of legal difficulties with Stiff's distributor, Island Records. It was released on 22 July 1977. Two weeks earlier, Costello had left his job as a computer operator at Elizabeth Arden on the condition that Stiff pay him, as an advance on future royalties, a regular stipend equal to the wages he had been earning at his job.\n1977\u20131979: Peak pop stardom.\nIn mid-June 1977, Costello held auditions for a bassist and keyboardist for a backing band for a tour to promote \"My Aim Is True\", wanting a sparser sound than on the album. Pete Thomas, formerly of pub-rock band Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers, who were managed by Riviera, agreed to be drummer, although Thomas was then living in California and needed to be brought back to England. Steve Goulding and Andrew Bodnar, rhythm section of the Rumour, also participated in these audition sessions, so that Costello could test how the musicians auditioning played as part of a band. Chosen were bassist Bruce Thomas (no relation to Pete), who was 28 years old and had ten years' experience in professional bands, the most successful being the Sutherland Brothers and Quiver; and keyboardist Steve Nieve (then Steve Nason), a 19-year-old student at the Royal College of Music who had formal musical training but no experience in any kind of pop group. The band, soon named the Attractions, would be Costello's touring and recording band for the next seven years.\n\"Watching the Detectives\" and commercial breakthrough.\nCostello used the time with Goulding and Bodnar to arrange and rehearse \"Watching the Detectives\". He recorded the song with them at Pathway a few days later. Costello had written the song a few weeks earlier, partly inspired by the Clash's newly released debut album. Some of the musical ideas, which Nieve fleshed out when he overdubbed his piano and organ parts a few weeks later, were inspired by film scores Bernard Herrmann had done for Alfred Hitchcock. Costello later called the recording of \"Watching the Detectives\" his first experience of \"making records as opposed to recording some songs in a room\". The song would be released as a non-album single in the UK and as a track on the US version of \"My Aim Is True\".\n\"My Aim Is True\" received extensive, favourable coverage in the UK music press through a combination of effective publicity stunts, such as Costello busking in front of the London hotel hosting the CBS Records business convention, and genuine enthusiasm for his music among music journalists. The album reached number 14 on the UK Albums Chart within a few weeks of its release. \"Watching the Detectives\", released in mid-October, reaching number 15 in the UK Singles Chart, becoming Costello's first single to chart in any country. This was the first of an unbroken streak of eight Costello singles to reach the UK top 30. When Costello began touring the US in mid-November, he received prominent coverage in the US press, even though he played venues holding fewer than a thousand people. By this time, Costello had signed to Columbia Records, who released \"My Aim Is True\" in the US in early November. The album gradually climbed to number 32 on the US \"Billboard\" Top LPs &amp; Tape chart and was named among the best albums of the year by US music critics. In mid-December, Costello and the Attractions appeared on \"Saturday Night Live\", where they angered the show's producer by unexpectedly playing the then-unrecorded song \"Radio Radio\" during the live broadcast.\nBy late 1977, Costello had moved from Stiff Records to Radar Records, a new label founded by an associate of Jake Riviera. Riviera had split from Dave Robinson and was now Costello's sole manager. For the next year and a half, Costello's records were released on Radar in Britain.\n\"This Year's Model\".\nCostello recorded his second album and his first with the Attractions, \"This Year's Model\", during short breaks from touring, from November 1977 through January 1978. Produced by Nick Lowe, it was recorded at Eden Studios, in west London, in eleven days. Inspirations for the album's sound included 1960s beat groups like the Who, the Kinks and Small Faces, as well as contemporary acts like Talking Heads, but the biggest influence was the Rolling Stones' album \"Aftermath\" (1966). Costello himself called \"This Year's Model\" \"a ghost version of \"Aftermath\"\" and \"This Year's Girl\" an answer song to the Rolling Stones' \"Stupid Girl\".\nMost of the songs on \"This Year's Model\" were written while Costello was still working a full-time office job, before his first album was released. Among them was \"(I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea\", which was released as the album's first single in early March 1978, reaching number 16 on the UK Singles Chart. The second single, \"Pump It Up\", which reached number 24, was written later, while Costello was on tour with other Stiff acts, in reaction to what he later called his \"first exposure to idiotic rock and roll decadence.\" Upon release in March, \"This Year's Model\" entered the UK Albums Chart at number 4. The US version of the album dropped \"(I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea\" and \"Night Rally\", a song written in response to the rise of the British National Front, and replaced them with \"Radio Radio\". The US release reached number 30 on the \"Billboard\" chart but spent fewer weeks on the chart than \"My Aim Is True\". \"Radio Radio\" was released as a non-album single in the UK in October 1978, where it reached number 29.\n\"This Year's Model\" was highly praised by critics in Britain and the US. \"Melody Maker\" called it an \"achievement so comprehensive, so inspired, that it exhausts superlatives.\" The \"NME\" review read similarly, saying the album was \"so ridiculously good that one's immediate inclinations are to clamber effusively over the top, superlative peaking superlative.\" The \"Village Voice\" Pazz &amp; Jop critics' poll voted it the best album of 1978. \"Rolling Stone\" named it among the best five albums of 1978.\nFor the seven months following the completion of \"This Year's Model\", Costello and the Attractions continued touring Britain, Europe and North America, playing larger venues and debuting new songs that Costello was writing for his next album. In July 1978, Costello performed at the Danish Roskilde Festival, topping the bill with three other artists, premiering the song \"Oliver's Army\" that would become his biggest hit in the UK.\n\"Armed Forces\".\nCostello and the Attractions recorded his third album, \"Armed Forces\", at Eden Studios in six weeks from August and September 1978. It was again produced by Nick Lowe, but Costello himself provided greater creative control. Like \"This Year's Model\", the album's influences came from the music Costello and the Attractions listened to while touring, from the Berlin-era records of David Bowie and Iggy Pop to ABBA and Kraftwerk. Costello later said that \"Armed Forces\" was his first album of songs he wrote with an awareness of having an audience. The album's lyrics reflected his experiences on the road in the US, as well his continued concern over the rise of far-right political groups in the UK; the album was originally to be called \"Emotional Fascism\". Just before the album's completion in late September, Costello and the Attractions played to an audience of 150,000 in Brockwell Park, south London, as part of the second Rock Against Racism music festival. A few weeks later, they began six months of touring that included, for the first time, Japan and Australia, as well as the UK, Europe, Canada and the US.\nReleased in early January 1979, \"Armed Forces\" debuted at number 2 on the UK Albums Chart, and spent 28 weeks on the chart. In the US, it spent 25 weeks on the \"Billboard\" chart, peaking at number 10 in mid-March. The US release replaced \"Sunday's Best\" with Costello's cover of Lowe's \"(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding\". Costello's best-selling single, \"Oliver's Army\", was released in Britain in February. Costello has said he wrote the song after his first visit to Northern Ireland and was inspired by seeing young British soldiers on the streets of Belfast as a part of the Troubles. The song reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart. It was also his biggest hit single in Ireland, reaching number 4 on the Irish singles chart. The second single, \"Accidents Will Happen\", was released in early May. According to Costello, the song was written in response to his own marital infidelities. The song reached number 28 in the UK. In the US, it reached number 101, missing the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 but charting higher than any previous Costello single.\nThe concert tour promoting \"Armed Forces\" was marked by bad publicity. Costello and the Attractions played some shows that audiences considered too brief and refused to return for encores. Audiences in Sydney, Australia, and Berkeley, California, responded by vandalising the concert venues. After a concert in Columbus, Ohio, on 15 March, Costello got into a drunken argument at a hotel bar with members of the Stephen Stills band and entourage. The argument culminated in Costello disparaging James Brown and Ray Charles with racially charged insults, in comments he would later call \"the exact opposite of my true feelings\". When Costello's comments were reported in the press a few weeks later, the bad publicity was sufficiently severe and widespread to be regarded, including by Costello himself, as the reason he never achieved the top-level commercial success in the US that had been predicted for him.\nIn June, Costello had a hit as a songwriter when Dave Edmunds released his recording of \"Girls Talk\", a song Costello had written but not yet recorded. Edmunds' version reached number 4 on the UK Singles Chart and number 65 on \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n1980s.\nCostello's 1980 \"Get Happy!!\" album featured a sound based on vintage American soul music. Some songs marked a distinct change in mood from the angry, frustrated tone of his first three albums to a more upbeat, happy manner. The single, \"I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down\", was a rendition of a Sam and Dave song. Lyrically, the songs are full of Costello's signature wordplay. His only 1980 appearance in North America was at the Heatwave festival in August near Toronto.\nIn January 1981, Costello released \"Trust\" amidst growing tensions within the Attractions. The single \"Watch Your Step\" was released in the US only and played live on Tom Snyder's \"Tomorrow\" show, and received airplay on FM rock radio. In the UK, the single \"Clubland\" scraped the lower reaches of the UK Singles Chart; follow-up single \"From a Whisper to a Scream\" (a duet with Glenn Tilbrook of Squeeze) became the first Costello single in over four years to completely miss the chart. Costello also co-produced Squeeze's 1981 album \"East Side Story\" (with Roger B\u00e9chirian) and performed backing vocals on the group's hit \"Tempted\".\nOctober saw the release of \"Almost Blue\", a cover album of country music including songs written by Hank Williams (\"Why Don't You Love Me (Like You Used to Do?)\"), Merle Haggard (\"Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down\"), Gram Parsons (\"How Much I Lied\") and George Jones (\"Brown to Blue\"). The album received mixed reviews. The first pressings of the record in the UK bore a sticker with the message: \"WARNING: This album contains country &amp; western music and may cause a radical reaction in narrow minded listeners\". \"Almost Blue\" did spawn a surprise UK hit single with a version of Jerry Chesnut's \"Good Year for the Roses\", which reached number 6. Costello had long been an avid country music fan and has cited George Jones as his favourite country singer. He had appeared on Jones' duet album \"My Very Special Guests\", contributing \"Stranger in the House\", which they later performed together on a 1981 HBO special dedicated to Jones.\n\"Imperial Bedroom\" (1982) featured lavish production by Geoff Emerick, engineer of several Beatles records. It remains one of his most critically acclaimed records, but again it failed to produce any hit singles\u2014\"You Little Fool\" and the critically acclaimed \"Man Out of Time\" both failed to reach the Top 40 in the UK. Costello collaborated with Chris Difford, also of Squeeze, to write the song \"Boy With a Problem\". Costello has said he disliked the marketing pitch for the album. \"Imperial Bedroom\" also featured Costello's song \"Almost Blue\", inspired by the music of jazz singer and trumpeter Chet Baker. Baker later recorded his own version of the song. \"Imperial Bedroom\" placed first on the \"Village Voice\"'s annual Pazz &amp; Jop poll.\nIn 1983, he released \"Punch the Clock\", featuring female backing vocal duo (Afrodiziak) and a four-piece horn section (the TKO Horns), alongside the Attractions. Clive Langer (who co-produced with Alan Winstanley), provided Costello with a melody which eventually became \"Shipbuilding\", which featured a trumpet solo by Baker. Prior to the release of Costello's own version, a version of the song was a minor UK hit for Soft Machine founder Robert Wyatt.\nUnder the pseudonym The Imposter, Costello released \"Pills and Soap\", an attack on the changes in British society brought on by Thatcherism, released to coincide with the run-up to the 1983 UK general election. \"Punch the Clock\" also generated an international hit in the single \"Everyday I Write the Book\", aided by a music video featuring lookalikes of Prince Charles and Princess Diana undergoing domestic strife in a suburban home. The song became Costello's first Top 40 hit single in the U.S. Also in the same year, Costello provided vocals on a version of the Madness song \"Tomorrow's Just Another Day\" released as a B-side.\nTensions within the band \u2013 notably between Costello and bassist Bruce Thomas \u2013 were beginning to tell, and Costello announced his retirement and the break-up of the group shortly before they were to record \"Goodbye Cruel World\" (1984). Costello later expressed disappointment with the final album's production, describing it as \"probably the worst record that I could have made of a decent bunch of songs.\". The record was poorly received upon its initial release; the liner notes to the 1995 Rykodisc re-release, penned by Costello, begin with the words \"Congratulations! You've just purchased our worst album\". Costello's retirement, although short-lived, was accompanied by two compilations, \"Elvis Costello: The Man\" in the UK, Europe and Australia, and \"The Best of Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions\" in the U.S. Daryl Hall provided backing vocals on the song \"The Only Flame in Town\" on \"Goodbye Cruel World\".\nIn 1985, he appeared in the Live Aid benefit concert in England, singing the Beatles' \"All You Need Is Love\" as a solo artist. Costello introduced the song as an \"old northern English folk song\", and the audience was invited to sing the chorus. In the same year Costello teamed up with friend T\u00a0Bone Burnett for the single \"The People's Limousine\" under the moniker of The Coward Brothers. That year, Costello also produced \"Rum Sodomy &amp; the Lash\" for the Irish punk/folk band the Pogues and he sang with Annie Lennox on the song \"Adrian\" from the Eurythmics record \"Be Yourself Tonight\".\nGrowing antipathy between Costello and Bruce Thomas contributed to the Attractions' first split in 1986 when Costello was preparing to make a comeback. Working in the U.S. with Burnett, a band containing a number of Elvis Presley's sidemen (including James Burton and Jerry Scheff), and minor input from the Attractions, he produced \"King of America\", an acoustic guitar-driven album with a country sound. It was billed as performed by \"The Costello Show featuring the Attractions and Confederates\" in the UK and Europe and \"The Costello Show featuring Elvis Costello\" in North America. Around this time he legally changed his name back to Declan MacManus, adding Aloysius as an extra middle name. Costello retooled his upcoming tour to allow for multiple nights in each city, playing one night with the Confederates, one night with the Attractions, and one night solo acoustic. In May 1986, he performed at Self Aid, a benefit concert held in Dublin that focused on the chronic unemployment which was widespread in Ireland at that time.\nLater that year, Costello returned to the studio with the Attractions and recorded \"Blood &amp; Chocolate\", which was lauded for a post-punk fervour not heard since 1978's \"This Year's Model\". It also marked the return of producer Nick Lowe, who had produced Costello's first five albums. While \"Blood &amp; Chocolate\" failed to chart a hit single of any significance, it did produce what has since become one of Costello's signature concert songs, \"I Want You\". On this album, Costello adopted the alias Napoleon Dynamite, the name he later attributed to the character of the emcee that he played during the vaudeville-style tour to support \"Blood &amp; Chocolate\". (The pseudonym had previously been used in 1982, when the B-side single \"Imperial Bedroom\" was credited to Napoleon Dynamite &amp; the Royal Guard; whether the title of the 2004 film \"Napoleon Dynamite\" was inspired by Costello is disputed). After the tour for \"Blood &amp; Chocolate\", Costello split from the Attractions, due mostly to lingering tensions between him and Bruce Thomas. Costello continued to work with another Attraction, Pete Thomas, as a session musician for future releases.\nCostello's recording contract with Columbia Records ended after \"Blood &amp; Chocolate\". In 1987, he released a compilation album, \"Out of Our Idiot\", on his UK label, Demon Records consisting of B-sides, side projects, and unreleased songs from recording sessions from 1980 to 1987. He signed a new contract with Warner Bros. and in early 1989 released \"Spike\", which spawned his biggest single in the U.S., the Top 20 hit (it reached number 19) \"Veronica\", one of several songs Costello co-wrote with Paul McCartney. At the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards on 6 September in Los Angeles, \"Veronica\" won the MTV Award for Best Male Video.\nCostello and McCartney wrote several songs together over a short period, which were released over a number of years:\nIn 1987, Costello appeared on the HBO special \"Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night\", a tribute to his long-time idol Roy Orbison. Costello co-wrote \"The Other End (Of the Telescope)\" with the American singer-songwriter Aimee Mann. It appears on the 1988 album \"Everything's Different Now\" by Mann's band Til Tuesday.\n1990s.\nIn 1991, Costello released \"Mighty Like a Rose\", which featured the single \"The Other Side of Summer\". He also co-composed and co-produced, with Richard Harvey, the title and incidental music for the mini-series \"G.B.H.\" by Alan Bleasdale. This entirely instrumental, and largely orchestral, soundtrack garnered a BAFTA, for Best Music for a TV Series for the pair.\nIn 1993, Costello experimented with classical music with a critically acclaimed collaboration with the Brodsky Quartet on \"The Juliet Letters\". During this period, he wrote a full album's worth of material for Wendy James, and these songs became the tracks on her 1993 solo album \"Now Ain't the Time for Your Tears\". Costello returned to rock and roll the following year with a project that reunited him with the Attractions, \"Brutal Youth\". In 1995, he released \"Kojak Variety\", an album of cover songs recorded five years earlier, and followed in 1996 with an album of songs originally written for other artists, \"All This Useless Beauty\". This was the final album of original material that he issued under his Warner Bros. contract, and also his final album with the Attractions.\nIn 1994, he sang \"They Can't Take That Away from Me\" with Tony Bennett for \"MTV Unplugged\", appearing on the album released from the broadcast.\nIn the spring of 1996, Costello played a series of intimate club dates, backed only by Steve Nieve on the piano, in support of \"All This Useless Beauty\". An ensuing mid-year tour with the Attractions proved to be the death knell, with relations between Costello and bassist Bruce Thomas at a breaking point, Costello announced that the current tour would be the Attractions' last. The quartet performed their final U.S. show in Seattle, Washington on 1 September 1996, before wrapping up their tour in Japan. Costello continued to work frequently with Attractions Steve Nieve and Pete Thomas; eventually, both became members of Costello's new back-up band, The Imposters.\nTo fulfill his contractual obligations to Warner Bros., Costello released a greatest hits album titled \"Extreme Honey\" (1997). It contained an original track titled \"The Bridge I Burned\", featuring Costello's son, Matt, on bass. In the intervening period, Costello had served as artistic chair for the 1995 Meltdown Festival, which gave him the opportunity to explore his increasingly eclectic musical interests. His involvement in the festival yielded a one-off live EP with jazz guitarist Bill Frisell, which featured both cover material and a few of his own songs.\nIn 1998, Costello signed a multi-label contract with Polygram Records, sold by its parent company the same year to become part of the Universal Music Group. Costello released his new work on what he deemed the suitable imprimatur within the family of labels. His first new release as part of this contract involved a collaboration with Burt Bacharach. Their work had commenced earlier, in 1996, on \"God Give Me Strength\" for the movie \"Grace of My Heart\". This led the pair to write and record the critically acclaimed album \"Painted From Memory\", released under his new contract in 1998, on the Mercury Records label, featuring songs that were largely inspired by the dissolution of his relationship with Cait O'Riordan. Costello and Bacharach performed several concerts with full orchestral backing, and also recorded an updated version of Bacharach's \"I'll Never Fall in Love Again\" for the soundtrack to ', with both appearing in the film to perform the song. He also wrote \"I Throw My Toys Around\" for \"The Rugrats Movie\" and performed it with No Doubt. The same year, he collaborated with Paddy Moloney of The Chieftains on \"The Long Journey Home\" on the soundtrack of the PBS/Disney ' miniseries. The soundtrack won a Grammy Award in 1999.\nIn 1999, Costello contributed a version of \"She\", released in 1974 by Charles Aznavour and Herbert Kretzmer, for the soundtrack of the film \"Notting Hill\", with Trevor Jones producing. Costello's version of the song reached number 19 on the UK singles chart. For the 25th anniversary of \"Saturday Night Live\", Costello was invited to the programme, where he re-enacted his abrupt song-switch: This time, however, he interrupted the Beastie Boys' \"Sabotage\", and they acted as his backing group for \"Radio Radio\". He also co-wrote another song with Aimee Mann, \"The Fall of the World's Own Optimist\", for her 2000 album \"Bachelor No. 2\".\n2000s.\nFrom 2001 to 2005, Costello re-issued his back catalogue in the U.S., from \"My Aim Is True\" (1977) to \"All This Useless Beauty\" (1996), on double-disc collections on the Rhino Records label. These releases, which each contained second discs of bonus material, ultimately fell out of print by 2007 after Universal Music acquired the rights to Costello's catalogue. Universal subsequently released new deluxe editions of \"My Aim Is True\" and \"This Year's Model\" with new bonus material of full-length concerts from the time of each album's release. These deluxe editions also fell out of print and Universal has reverted to re-releasing Costello's pre-1987 albums in their original context without bonus material.\nIn 2000, Costello wrote lyrics to \"Green Song\", a solo cello piece by Svante Henryson; this song appears on the Anne Sofie von Otter album \"For the Stars\".\nIn 2000, Costello appeared at the Town Hall, New York, in Steve Nieve's opera \"Welcome to the Voice\", alongside Ron Sexsmith and John Flansburgh of They Might Be Giants. In 2001, Costello was artist-in-residence at UCLA and wrote the music for a new ballet. He produced and appeared on an album of pop songs for the classical singer Anne Sofie von Otter. He released the album \"When I Was Cruel\" in 2002 on Island Records, and toured with a new band, the Imposters (essentially the Attractions but with a different bass player, Davey Faragher, formerly of Cracker).\nOn 23 February 2003, Costello, along with Bruce Springsteen, Steven Van Zandt and Dave Grohl, performed a version of The Clash's \"London Calling\" at the 45th Grammy Awards ceremony, in honour of Clash frontman Joe Strummer, who had died the previous December. In March, Elvis Costello &amp; the Attractions were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In May, he announced his engagement to Canadian jazz singer and pianist Diana Krall, whom he had seen in concert and then met backstage at the Sydney Opera House in Australia. That September, he released \"North\", an album of piano-based ballads concerning the breakdown of his former marriage, and his falling in love with Krall.\nThe song \"Scarlet Tide\" (co-written by Costello and T\u00a0Bone Burnett and used in the film \"Cold Mountain\") was nominated for a 2004 Academy Award; he performed it at the awards ceremony with Alison Krauss, who sang the song on the official soundtrack. Costello co-wrote many songs on Krall's 2004 CD, \"The Girl in the Other Room\", the first of hers to feature several original compositions. In July 2004, Costello's first full-scale orchestral work, \"Il Sogno\", was performed in New York. The work, a ballet based on Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", was commissioned by Italian dance troupe Aterballeto, and received critical acclaim from classical music critics. Performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas, the recording was released on CD in September by Deutsche Grammophon. In September 2004, Costello released the album \"The Delivery Man\", recorded in Oxford, Mississippi, on Lost Highway Records, and it was hailed as one of his best.\nA CD recording of a collaboration with Marian McPartland on her show \"Piano Jazz\" was released in 2005. It featured Costello singing six jazz standards and two of his own songs, accompanied by McPartland on piano.\nA 2005 tour included a gig at Glastonbury that Costello considered so dreadful that he said \"I don't care if I ever play England again. That gig made up my mind I wouldn't come back. I don't get along with it. We lost touch. It's 25 years since I lived there. I don't dig it, they don't dig me...British music fans don't have the same attitude to age as they do in America, where young people come to check out, say Willie Nelson. They feel some connection with him and find a role for that music in their lives\".\nIn 2005, Costello performed with Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong. They played both Costello and Green Day songs together, including \"Alison\", \"No Action\", \"Basket Case\" and \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\".\nIn November, Costello started recording a new album with Allen Toussaint and producer Joe Henry. Costello had a collaborative history with Toussaint, beginning with a couple of scattered album tracks in the 1980s. In September 2006, Costello and Allen Toussaint performed in New York at a series of benefit concerts for victims of Hurricane Katrina. By week's end, Costello had written \"The River in Reverse\", performed it with Toussaint and discussed plans for an album with Verve Records executives. Costello turned to older songs to reflect the national malaise at the time.\nIn a studio recording of Nieve's opera \"Welcome to the Voice\" (2006, Deutsche Grammophon), Costello interpreted the character of Chief of Police, with Barbara Bonney, Robert Wyatt, Sting and Amanda Roocroft, and the album reached No.\u00a02 in the \"Billboard\" classical charts. Costello later reprised the piece on the stage of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris in 2008, with Sting, Joe Sumner (Sting's son) and Sylvia Schwartz. Also released in 2006 was a live recording of a concert with the Metropole Orkest at the North Sea Jazz Festival, entitled \"My Flame Burns Blue\". The soundtrack for \"House, M.D.\" featured Costello's interpretation of \"Beautiful\" by Christina Aguilera, with the song appearing in the second episode of Season 2.\nCostello was commissioned to write a chamber opera by the Danish Royal Opera, Copenhagen, on the subject of Hans Christian Andersen's infatuation with Swedish soprano Jenny Lind. Called \"The Secret Songs\", it remained unfinished. In a performance in 2007 directed by Kasper Bech Holten at the Opera's studio theatre (Takelloftet), finished songs were interspersed with pieces from Costello's 1993 collaborative classical album \"The Juliet Letters\", featuring Danish soprano Sine Bundgaard as Lind. The 2009 album \"Secret, Profane &amp; Sugarcane\" includes material from \"Secret Songs\".\nOn 22 April 2008, \"Momofuku\" was released on Lost Highway Records, the same imprint that released \"The Delivery Man\", his previous studio album. The album was, at least initially, released exclusively on vinyl (with a code to download a digital copy). That summer, in support of the album, Costello toured with the Police on the final leg of their 2007/2008 Reunion Tour. Costello played a homecoming gig at the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall on 25 June 2006. and, that month, gave his first performance in Poland, appearing with The Imposters for the closing gig of the Malta theatre festival in Pozna\u0144.\nIn 2006, Costello performed with Fiona Apple in the Decades Rock TV special. Apple performed two Costello songs and Costello performed two Apple songs.\nIn 2007, Costello collaborated with the Argentinean/Uruguayan electro-tango band Bajofondo on the song \"Fairly Right\" from the album \"Mar Dulce\". In 2008, Costello collaborated with Fall Out Boy on the track \"What a Catch, Donnie\" from their album \"Folie a Deux\". In Jenny Lewis' 2008 release, \"Acid Tongue\", Costello provided vocals for the song \"Carpetbaggers\". In November 2009, Costello appeared live with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band at Madison Square Garden and performed the Jackie Wilson song \"(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher\".\nIn July 2008, Costello (as Declan McManus) appeared in his home city Liverpool where he was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Music from the University of Liverpool. Costello was featured on Fall Out Boy's 2008 album \"Folie \u00e0 Deux\", providing vocals on the track \"What a Catch, Donnie\", along with other artists who are friends with the band.\nCostello appeared in Stephen Colbert's television special \"\". In the program, he was eaten by a bear, but later saved by Santa Claus; he also sang a duet with Colbert. The special was first aired on 23 November 2008. Costello released \"Secret, Profane &amp; Sugarcane\", a collaboration with T\u00a0Bone Burnett, on 9 June 2009. It was his first on the Starbucks Hear Music label and a return to country music in the manner of \"Good Year for the Roses\".\nIn May 2009, Costello made a surprise cameo appearance on-stage at the Beacon Theatre in New York as part of Spinal Tap's \"Unwigged and Unplugged\" show, singing their fictional 1965 hit \"Gimme Some Money\" with the band backing him up.\nIn December 2009, Costello portrayed The Shape on the album \"Ghost Brothers of Darkland County\", a collaboration between rock singer John Mellencamp and novelist Stephen King. In February 2010, Costello appeared in the live cinecast of Garrison Keillor's \"Prairie Home Companion\", singing some of his own songs, and participating in many of the show's other musical and acting performances. On 30 April 2011, he played the song \"Pump it Up\" with the Odds before the start of a Vancouver Canucks playoff game at Rogers Arena in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n2010\u2013present.\nCostello released the album \"National Ransom\" in autumn of 2010.\nOn 26 February 2012, Costello paid tribute to music legends Chuck Berry and Leonard Cohen, who were the recipients of the first annual PEN Awards for songwriting excellence, at the JFK Presidential Library, in Boston, Massachusetts. In September 2013 Costello released \"Wise Up Ghost\", a collaboration with the Roots. On 25 October 2013, Costello was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from the New England Conservatory.\nIn 2012, he played ukulele, mandolin, guitar and added backing vocals on Diana Krall's 11th studio album, \"Glad Rag Doll\" (as \"Howard Coward\"). On 10 September 2013, he played during the Apple September 2013 Event after the introduction of iTunes Radio, iPhone 5C and 5S at Town Hall, at the Apple campus.\nOn Gov't Mule's album \"Shout!\", released in September 2013, he sang on the track \"Funny Little Tragedy\". In March 2014, Costello recorded \"\" with Rhiannon Giddens, Taylor Goldsmith, Jim James and Marcus Mumford. During the 2016 Detour, he performs with Larkin Poe.\nOn 12 October 2018, Costello released his first studio album in five years, \"Look Now\", recorded with The Imposters. The album features three songs co-written with Burt Bacharach, and one song co-written with Carole King. Costello wrote and produced a large majority of the album himself, with help from producer Sebastian Krys. On 26 January 2020, \"Look Now\" won the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album at the 62nd Grammy Awards.\nCostello was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for services to music.\nIn 2021, Costello released \"Spanish Model\", a remix of 1978's \"This Year's Model\" with Spanish lyrics. Singers from Spanish-speaking parts of the world, with help from Spanish-speaking songwriters, translated all 16 songs of the album into Spanish, with the new vocals set to the original recording and instrumentation by the Attractions. The singers included Juanes, Jorge Drexler, Luis Fonsi, Francisca Valenzuela, Fuego, Draco Rosa, and Fito P\u00e1ez.\nIn 2021, Costello appeared at the Royal Variety Performance playing two songs with the Imposters. He was introduced by the MC Alan Carr as a man who has achieved everything except appearing at the Royal Variety Performance. Between songs Costello informed the audience that he was the second McManus to appear. His father Ross appeared in the 1960s singing \"If I Had a Hammer\".\nIn January 2022, he performed on \"The Graham Norton Show\". That same month he released the LP \"The Boy Named If\", recorded with the Imposters. \"The Resurrection of Rust\" by a reformed Rusty followed later that year.\nIn April 2023, Costello collaborated with Slovenian band Joker Out on their single, \"New Wave\". The compilation \"The Songs of Bacharach &amp; Costello\" was also released at this time. In August 2023, he made a three-dates mini-tour together with Italian singer-songwriter Carmen Consoli, a project the two had originally planned in 2012 but that at the time had been shelved due to Consoli's pregnancy.\nIn November 2024, Costello and T\u00a0Bone Burnett released a scripted comedy audio series on Audible, directed by Christopher Guest, as the Coward Brothers, characters the two created in the 1980s. The series features guest appearances by Harry Shearer as the radio host interviewing the two, along with Rhea Seehorn, Edward Hibbert, Stephen Root and Kathreen Khavari. An accompanying soundtrack album was released via New West Records.\nWriting.\nSince the early 1980s, Costello has written about music for publications including \"Hot Press,\" \"Details\", \"Mojo\", \"Musician\", \"NME\", \"Rolling Stone\", and \"Vanity Fair.\" He has also written several articles about football (soccer), as an avid and knowledgeable fan, for the \"Times\" of London. A \"Vanity Fair\" editor who worked with Costello said, \"His copy was clean, elegant, and ready to run.\"\nCostello has written liner notes for releases by artists including Gram Parsons, the Fairfield Four, Dusty Springfield, Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s, Burt Bacharach, and Bill Frisell. He has written forewords to books by Geoff Emerick, Loretta Lynn, and Wanda Jackson.\nIn 1993, Costello began reissuing his catalog of albums from 1977 through 1986, on Rykodisc, and wrote detailed liner notes for each reissued album. Reviewers praised these liner notes as frank and charming. In 2001, he began a second round of reissues, this time of his catalog from 1977 through 1996, on Rhino Entertainment, and wrote even more detailed liner notes. \"Goldmine\" said the Rhino liner notes brought \"a wealth of insight into the songs and the creative process itself\" and that \"liner notes simply don't get any better than this.\" \"Pitchfork\" called them \"truly fascinating.\" Several journalists noted that, at a total of 60,000 words, the Rhino liner notes amounted to a serialised memoir. In 2012, \"Slate\" magazine published a book review of the Rhino liner notes in which it called them \"one of the best rock-star memoirs of the last decade.\"\nIn 2015, Costello published \"Unfaithful Music &amp; Disappearing Ink\", a memoir that had little overlap with his reissue liner notes. In this book, Costello recounted his life in music and traced parallels between his own experiences and those of his father and grandfather, both of whom were musicians. The book received enthusiastic positive reviews from prominent publications. The \"New York Times\" said it contained \"some of the best writing \u2013 funny, strange, spiteful, anguished \u2013 we've ever had from an important musician.\" The \"Washington Post\" praised it as having more in common with Frank McCourt's memoir \"Angela's Ashes\" than M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's and said it was more enjoyable than Keith Richards' \"Life\" and Bob Dylan's \"\". However, some positive reviews noted that the quality of the writing in the book was uneven and that the book might have been improved by being shorter, more focused thematically, or both. The few negative reviews the book received criticised its nonlinear structure, its relative lack of emphasis on Costello's pop-star period, and its lack of details about his romantic relationships. The book reached number 7 on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list. It was shortlisted for the Penderyn Music Book Prize, a British award for excellence in writing about music. The audiobook, narrated by Costello, was nominated for a Grammy Award.\nActing and television presenting.\nCostello has played himself or fictional characters very similar to himself in movies and television shows including \"\" (1999), \"The Simpsons\" (2002), \"Frasier\" (2003), \"Two and a Half Men\" (2004), \"30 Rock\" (2009), \"Treme\" (2010), and \"Sesame Street\" (2011). He has also played more character-based roles, such as the title character's eccentric brother in screenwriter Alan Bleasdale's television series \"Scully\" (1984), an inept magician in Bleasdale's movie \"No Surrender\" (1985)\",\" a teacher at an impoverished school in the movie \"Prison Song\" (2001), and the title character's father in the children's animated series \"The Adventures of Pete the Cat\" (2017). In 1995, he appeared as a guest pundit on the British football commentary television show \"Football Italia\".\nIn 2003, Costello substituted for an ailing David Letterman as the host of \"Late Show with David Letterman\"\", making him the only musical guest of the show to have served as guest host. Costello's performance on that show led to interest in developing a music-oriented talk show with him as the host, which came to fruition a few years later.\nIn 2008, Costello began production on \"\", a show on which he interviewed and performed songs with other musicians. Guests included Tony Bennett, Bruce Springsteen, Smokey Robinson, Bono and the Edge of U2, opera singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming, and former president (and accomplished saxophonist) Bill Clinton. The series ran for 20 episodes over two seasons from 2008 through 2010. It aired on Sundance Channel in the US, CTV in Canada, and Channel 4 in the UK. The show received favourable reviews in the US, with reviewers praising Costello's ability to get his guests to reveal insights into their creative processes and calling him a \"deeply knowledgeable, erudite and witty host.\" In Canada, the show won a Gemini Award for Best Talk Series. In Britain, however, it was aired in an overnight time slot and largely ignored.\nPublic image and controversies.\nCostello revealed little about his background and gave few interviews in the first five years of his career, so the few widely published interviews he gave played a large role in forming his early public image. In a widely quoted August 1977 interview with Nick Kent, Costello said the only things that mattered to him were \"revenge and guilt\". This phrase would be associated with him throughout his career.\n1977 \"Saturday Night Live\" appearance.\nOn 17 December 1977, Costello and the Attractions appeared on \"Saturday Night Live\" as last-minute replacements for the Sex Pistols. One of the songs Costello was scheduled to perform, at the request of his record company, was \"Less Than Zero\", a song Costello wrote in reaction to seeing British fascist Oswald Mosley being treated with what Costello felt was undeserved deference during an interview on British television. Costello did not want to play the song because he thought the subject was too obscure for American audiences and the song was too low-key to make a strong impression. Instead, he wanted to play the then-unrecorded song, \"Radio Radio\". During the live broadcast, Costello played a few bars of \"Less Than Zero\" and then told the Attractions to play \"Radio Radio\", which they played in its entirety. This angered the show's producer, Lorne Michaels, because Michaels was not prepared for the change and because \"Radio Radio\" had not been cleared by NBC's censors. When asked about the incident on NBC's \"Tomorrow Show\" three years later, Costello said he was told he would never appear on American television again. He appeared as musical guest on \"Saturday Night Live\" again in 1989 and 1991. Although the incident provoked little comment at the time, by 1999 it had become so well known that \"Saturday Night Live\" invited Costello to perform a parody of it with the Beastie Boys on the show's 25th anniversary special.\n1979 Columbus incident.\nIn March 1979, during a drunken argument with Bonnie Bramlett and other members of the Stephen Stills band, at a Holiday Inn bar in Columbus, Ohio, Costello referred to James Brown as a \"jive-ass nigger\", then pronounced Ray Charles a \"blind, ignorant nigger\". At a New York City press conference a few days later, Costello said he had been drunk and had been attempting to be obnoxious to bring the conversation to a swift conclusion, not anticipating that Bramlett would bring his comments to the press. According to Costello, \"It became necessary for me to outrage these people with about the most obnoxious and offensive remarks that I could muster.\"\nIn his liner notes for the expanded version of \"Get Happy!!\" Costello writes that some time after the incident he had declined an offer to meet Charles out of guilt and embarrassment, although Charles himself had forgiven Costello, saying \"Drunken talk isn't meant to be printed in the paper.\" Costello worked extensively in Britain's Rock Against Racism campaign both before and after the incident. In an interview with Questlove (drummer for the Roots, with whom Costello collaborated in 2013), he stated: \"It's upsetting because I can't explain how I even got to think you could be funny about something like that,\" and further elaborating with, \"I'm sorry. You know? It's about time I said it out loud.\"\n2010 cancelled Tel Aviv concerts.\nIn early 2010, Costello was invited to play his first concert in Israel, on 30 June of that year, at the Caesarea Amphitheater north of Tel Aviv. Due to high demand for tickets, a second concert was added for 1 July. At first, Costello seemed resolved to resist political pressure on artists to refrain from performing in Israel due to the country's controversial treatment of Palestinians. In early May, Costello told Israel's largest daily newspaper, \"Yedioth Ahronoth\", \"As soon as you play you are going to get criticised.\" Costello told the newspaper he did not agree with organisations that \"think that they need to boycott Israel to pressure it,\" saying he thought \"culture is the only way in which humanity shares experiences, and that is why I need to come and perform here.\" Two weeks later, he announced on his website that he had cancelled the concerts because of what he called the \"grave and complex\" sensitivities of the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict. He told \"The Jerusalem Post\" his decision was part of a \"30-year conundrum\" that he had been dealing with regarding playing in Israel. He also told the \"Post\" that he had not been threatened or coerced, but that he \"woke up one day and realised [he] couldn't go on with the shows.\" The promoters of the concerts expressed shock. Israeli Culture Minister Limor Livnat, a member of right-wing Likud Party, denounced the decision. The organisation Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel praised it.\nPersonal life.\nCostello has no full siblings. He has four half-brothers from his father's second marriage, all of whom are musicians.\nIn November 1974, Costello married Mary Burgoyne. Costello has said he had hoped to marry Burgoyne since he was 14 years old and they were at school together in London, although they did not begin dating until four years later, when Costello moved back to London after living with his mother in Liverpool for two and a half years. They have one child, Matthew MacManus, born in early 1975. Costello's rapid rise to fame put a strain on their marriage almost immediately. The couple separated in early 1978 but reconciled the following year. They separated permanently in mid-1984 and finalised their divorce in 1988. Costello has said that his inability to remain faithful in his first marriage, and the emotional turmoil it caused him, has been a major inspiration for his songs.\nIn early 1985, Costello began a romantic relationship with Cait O'Riordan, then bass player for the Pogues, whom he met in October 1984 while their respective bands were on tour together. In May 1986, they exchanged wedding rings and thereafter presented themselves, and were regarded, as husband and wife. They were never legally married. In September 2002, Costello ended the relationship. O'Riordan said that she was never married, that there was \"no piece of paper with marriage on it\". They have no children. Since their split, both Costello and O'Riordan have described the union as unhappy.\nIn early 2003, Costello became engaged to and went on to marry singer and pianist Diana Krall, whom he met at the Grammy Awards ceremony the year before. They married in December 2003. The couple has twin sons, born in December 2006.\nHealth.\nIn July 2018, Costello announced that he had been successfully treated for a cancerous growth six weeks earlier, but needed to cancel the remaining six dates of his European tour to continue recovering from the surgery. Costello said he had underestimated how much time he would need to recover. He resumed performing in September 2018.\nHumanitarian causes.\nIn 2017, Costello helped establish the Musician Treatment Foundation as a member of its board of directors. The foundation, which is based in Austin, Texas, helps under- and uninsured professional musicians receive free orthopedic care for upper limb injuries. He performed concerts for the foundation's benefit in October 2017 and December 2022.\nCostello sits on the advisory board of the board of directors of the Jazz Foundation of America, which provides emergency financial support and other services to working and retired musicians.\nVegetarianism.\nA pescatarian since the early 1980s, Costello says he was moved to reject meat after seeing the documentary \"The Animals Film\" (1982), which also helped inspire his song \"Pills and Soap\" from 1983's \"Punch the Clock\". In January 2013, Costello teamed up with Paul McCartney to create an advertisement campaign backing vegetarian foods produced by the Linda McCartney Foods brand.\nLegacy.\nCostello is considered by experts in pop and rock music to be one of the best songwriters of his generation. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic summarised Costello as, \"The most evocative, innovative, and gifted songwriter since Bob Dylan, with songs that offer highly personal takes on love and politics.\" In 2015, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked him 24th their list of the greatest songwriters of all time, calling him a songwriter of \"almost unparalleled versatility.\" When he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2016, the induction announcement said the impact of Costello's songs \"far out-distanced their commercial performance.\"\nCostello's debut album, \"My Aim Is True\", is widely considered one of the best debut albums in the history of rock music. On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the album's release, \"Billboard\" called it \"one of the most influential albums in the history of rock and punk\" and \"one of the strongest debut albums in history\". Although Costello never applied the term \"new wave\" to his music, Costello's early records helped defined the new wave music genre. AllMusic said, \"Costello's early albums changed the face of pop music by harnessing punk's energy to a leaner, more incisive aesthetic that included pop hooks, virtually inventing new wave in the process.\" In their 2013 list of greatest albums of all time, the \"NME\" described \"This Year's Model\" as \"defining the British new wave.\" In their 2009 list of greatest albums of all time, \"Rolling Stone\" said \"the keyboard-driven sound of [Costello's 1979 song] 'Accidents Will Happen' helped define New Wave.\"\nMusical artists with little connection to new wave have also claimed influence by Costello. Bruce Springsteen has said that comments Costello made in the press criticising Springsteen's early songs as overly romantic led Springsteen to write darker songs for his 1978 album \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\". Thom Yorke of Radiohead called \"Blood &amp; Chocolate\" \"the album that made me change the way I thought about recording and writing music [and] lyrics\". Liz Phair, in her appreciation of Costello for \"Rolling Stone\" 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, wrote: \"I'd pay a great amount of money to audit a course taught by him.\" Suzanne Vega has called Costello one of the \"melodic geniuses\" whose music she listens to in order to \"stretch my sense of melody.\"\nProminent artists in other fields have claimed influence or inspiration from Costello. Filmmaker and comedian Judd Apatow has called Costello \"a gigantic inspiration to me\" and has suggested that he and other comedians are \"fanatical\" about Costello's music because of the \"spirit of standing up for what you believe in and the humor\" in it. Satirist and television host Stephen Colbert has described Costello as \"probably my favourite rock artist\" and said he sees parallels between his own humor and Costello's \"wry, sardonic\" songs. Novelist Bret Easton Ellis titled his 1985 novel \"Less Than Zero\" after a Costello song and its 2010 sequel \"Imperial Bedrooms\" after a Costello album. Ellis has said Costello was once his \"idol\". Visual artist Peter Blake featured Costello prominently in his 2012 reworking of the artwork he created for the cover of the Beatles' 1967 album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". Blake said he included people he admired and who had contributed to British culture since he created the original work.\nAwards and honours.\nEntertainment industry awards.\nUnited States:\nUnited Kingdom:\nNetherlands:\nCanada:\nCritics' best-of lists and music press awards.\nBest of year:\nBest of all time:"}
{"id": "10511", "revid": "23268594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10511", "title": "Epilepsy", "text": "Epilepsy is a group of non-communicable neurological disorders characterized by recurrent epileptic seizures. An epileptic seizure is the clinical manifestation of an abnormal, excessive, and synchronized electrical discharge in the neurons. The occurrence of two or more unprovoked seizures defines epilepsy. The occurrence of just one seizure may warrant the definition (set out by the International League Against Epilepsy) in a more clinical usage where recurrence may be able to be prejudged. Epileptic seizures can vary from brief and nearly undetectable periods to long periods of vigorous shaking due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. These episodes can result in physical injuries, either directly, such as broken bones, or through causing accidents. In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur and may have no detectable underlying cause. Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. People with epilepsy may be treated differently in various areas of the world and experience varying degrees of social stigma due to the alarming nature of their symptoms.\nThe underlying mechanism of an epileptic seizure is excessive and abnormal neuronal activity in the cortex of the brain, which can be observed in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of an individual. The reason this occurs in most cases of epilepsy is unknown (cryptogenic); some cases occur as the result of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, infections of the brain, or birth defects through a process known as epileptogenesis. Known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases. The diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms, such as fainting, and determining if another cause of seizures is present, such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems. This may be partly done by imaging the brain and performing blood tests. Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an EEG, but a normal reading does not rule out the condition.\nEpilepsy that occurs as a result of other issues may be preventable. Seizures are controllable with medication in about 69% of cases; inexpensive anti-seizure medications are often available. In those whose seizures do not respond to medication; surgery, neurostimulation or dietary changes may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed.\n, about 51\u00a0million people have epilepsy. Nearly 80% of cases occur in the developing world. In 2021, it resulted in 140,000 deaths, an increase from 125,000 in 1990. Epilepsy is more common in children and older people. In the developed world, onset of new cases occurs most frequently in babies and the elderly. In the developing world, onset is more common at the extremes of age \u2013 in younger children and in older children and young adults due to differences in the frequency of the underlying causes. About 5\u201310% of people will have an unprovoked seizure by the age of 80. The chance of experiencing a second seizure within two years after the first is around 40%. In many areas of the world, those with epilepsy either have restrictions placed on their ability to drive or are not permitted to drive until they are free of seizures for a specific length of time. The word \"epilepsy\" is from Ancient Greek , 'to seize, possess, or afflict'.\nSigns and symptoms.\nEpilepsy is characterized by a long-term risk of recurrent epileptic seizures. These seizures may present in several ways depending on the parts of the brain involved and the person's age.\nSeizures.\nThe most common type (60%) of seizures are convulsive which involve involuntary muscle contractions. Of these, one-third begin as generalized seizures from the start, affecting both hemispheres of the brain and impairing consciousness. Two-thirds begin as focal seizures (which affect one hemisphere of the brain) which may progress to generalized seizures. The remaining 40% of seizures are non-convulsive. An example of this type is the absence seizure, which presents as a decreased level of consciousness and usually lasts about 10 seconds.\nCertain experiences, known as auras often precede focal seizures. The seizures can include sensory (visual, hearing, or smell), psychic, autonomic, and motor phenomena depending on which part of the brain is involved. Muscle jerks may start in a specific muscle group and spread to surrounding muscle groups in which case it is known as a Jacksonian march. Automatisms may occur, which are non-consciously generated activities and mostly simple repetitive movements like smacking the lips or more complex activities such as attempts to pick up something.\nThere are six main types of generalized seizures:\nThey all involve loss of consciousness and typically happen without warning.\nTonic-clonic seizures occur with a contraction of the limbs followed by their extension and arching of the back which lasts 10\u201330\u00a0seconds (the tonic phase). A cry may be heard due to contraction of the chest muscles, followed by a shaking of the limbs in unison (clonic phase). Tonic seizures produce constant contractions of the muscles. A person often turns blue as breathing is stopped. In clonic seizures there is shaking of the limbs in unison. After the shaking has stopped it may take 10\u201330\u00a0minutes for the person to return to normal; this period is called the \"postictal state\" or \"postictal phase.\" Loss of bowel or bladder control may occur during a seizure. People experiencing a seizure may bite their tongue, either the tip or on the sides; in tonic-clonic seizure, bites to the sides are more common. Tongue bites are also relatively common in psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures are seizure like behavior without an associated synchronised electrical discharge on EEG and are considered a dissociative disorder.\nMyoclonic seizures involve very brief muscle spasms in either a few areas or all over. These sometimes cause the person to fall, which can cause injury. Absence seizures can be subtle with only a slight turn of the head or eye blinking with impaired consciousness; typically, the person does not fall over and returns to normal right after it ends. Atonic seizures involve losing muscle activity for greater than one second, typically occurring on both sides of the body. Rarer seizure types can cause involuntary unnatural laughter (gelastic), crying (dyscrastic), or more complex experiences such as \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\".\nAbout 6% of those with epilepsy have seizures that are often triggered by specific events and are known as reflex seizures. Those with reflex epilepsy have seizures that are only triggered by specific stimuli. Common triggers include flashing lights and sudden noises. In certain types of epilepsy, seizures happen more often during sleep, and in other types they occur almost only when sleeping. In 2017, the International League Against Epilepsy published new uniform guidelines for the classification of seizures as well as epilepsies along with their cause and comorbidities.\nSeizure clusters.\nPeople with epilepsy may experience seizure clusters which may be broadly defined as an acute deterioration in seizure control. The prevalence of seizure clusters is uncertain given that studies have used different definitions to define them. However, estimates suggest that the prevalence may range from 5% to 50% of people with epilepsy. People with refractory epilepsy who have a high seizure frequency are at the greatest risk for having seizure clusters. Seizure clusters are associated with increased healthcare use, worse quality of life, impaired psychosocial functioning, and possibly increased mortality. Benzodiazepines are used as an acute treatment for seizure clusters.\nPost-ictal.\nAfter the active portion of a seizure (the ictal state) there is typically a period of recovery during which there is confusion, referred to as the postictal period, before a normal level of consciousness returns. It usually lasts 3 to 15 minutes but may last for hours. Other common symptoms include feeling tired, headache, difficulty speaking, and abnormal behavior. Psychosis after a seizure is relatively common, occurring in 6\u201310% of people. Often people do not remember what happened during this time. Localized weakness, known as Todd's paralysis, may also occur after a focal seizure. It would typically last for seconds to minutes but may rarely last for a day or two.\nPsychosocial.\nEpilepsy can have adverse effects on social and psychological well-being. These effects may include social isolation, stigmatization, or disability. They may result in lower educational achievement and worse employment outcomes. Learning disabilities are common in those with the condition, and especially among children with epilepsy. The stigma of epilepsy can also affect the families of those with the disorder.\nCertain disorders occur more often in people with epilepsy, depending partly on the epilepsy syndrome present. These include depression, anxiety, obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD), and migraine. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects three to five times more children with epilepsy than children without the condition. ADHD and epilepsy have significant consequences on a child's behavioral, learning, and social development. Epilepsy is also more common in children with autism.\nApproximately, one-in-three people with epilepsy have a lifetime history of a psychiatric disorder. There are believed to be multiple causes for this including pathophysiological changes related to the epilepsy itself as well as adverse experiences related to living with epilepsy (e.g., stigma, discrimination). In addition, it is thought that the relationship between epilepsy and psychiatric disorders is not unilateral but rather bidirectional. For example, people with depression have an increased risk for developing new-onset epilepsy.\nThe presence of comorbid depression or anxiety in people with epilepsy is associated with a poorer quality of life, increased mortality, increased healthcare use and a worse response to treatment (including surgical). Anxiety disorders and depression may explain more variability in quality of life than seizure type or frequency. There is evidence that both depression and anxiety disorders are underdiagnosed and undertreated in people with epilepsy.\nCauses.\nEpilepsy can have both genetic and acquired causes, with the interaction of these factors in many cases. Established acquired causes include serious brain trauma, stroke, tumours, and brain problems resulting from a previous infection. In about 60% of cases, the cause is unknown. Epilepsies caused by genetic, congenital, or developmental conditions are more common among younger people, while brain tumors and strokes are more likely in older people.\nSeizures may also occur as a consequence of other health problems; if they occur right around a specific cause, such as a stroke, head injury, toxic ingestion, or metabolic problem, they are known as acute symptomatic seizures and are in the broader classification of seizure-related disorders rather than epilepsy itself.\nGenetics.\nGenetics is believed to be involved in the majority of cases, either directly or indirectly. Some epilepsies are due to a single gene defect (1\u20132%); most are due to the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors. Each of the single gene defects is rare, with more than 200 in all described. Most genes involved affect ion channels, either directly or indirectly. These include genes for ion channels, enzymes, GABA, and G protein-coupled receptors.\nIn identical twins, if one is affected, there is a 50\u201360% chance that the other will also be affected. In non-identical twins, the risk is 15%. These risks are greater in those with generalized rather than focal seizures. If both twins are affected, most of the time they have the same epileptic syndrome (70\u201390%). Other close relatives of a person with epilepsy have a risk five times that of the general population. Between 1 and 10% of those with Down syndrome and 90% of those with Angelman syndrome have epilepsy.\nPhakomatoses.\nPhakomatoses, also known as neurocutaneous disorders, are a group of multisystemic diseases that most prominently affect the skin and central nervous system. They are caused by defective development of the embryonic ectodermal tissue that is most often due to a single genetic mutation. The brain, as well as other neural tissue and the skin, are all derived from the ectoderm and thus defective development may result in epilepsy as well as other manifestations such as autism and intellectual disability. Some types of phakomatoses such as tuberous sclerosis complex and Sturge-Weber syndrome have a higher prevalence of epilepsy relative to others such as neurofibromatosis type 1.\nTuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant disorder that is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene and it affects approximately 1 in 6,000\u201310,000 live births. These mutations result in the upregulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway which leads to the growth of tumors in many organs including the brain, skin, heart, eyes and kidneys. In addition, abnormal mTOR activity is believed to alter neural excitability. The prevalence of epilepsy is estimated to be 80-90%. The majority of cases of epilepsy present within the first 3 years of life and are medically refractory. Relatively recent developments for the treatment of epilepsy in people with TSC include mTOR inhibitors, cannabidiol and vigabatrin. Epilepsy surgery is often pursued.\nSturge-Weber syndrome is caused by an activating somatic mutation in the GNAQ gene and it affects approximately 1 in 20,000\u201350,000 live births. The mutation results in vascular malformations affecting the brain, skin and eyes. The typical presentation includes a facial port-wine birthmark, ocular angiomas and cerebral vascular malformations which are most often unilateral but are bilateral in 15% of cases. The prevalence of epilepsy is 75-100% and is higher in those with bilateral involvement. Seizures typically occur within the first two years of life and are refractory in nearly half of cases. However, high rates of seizure freedom with surgery have been reported in as many as 83%.\nNeurofibromatosis type 1 is the most common phakomatoses and occurs in approximately 1 in 3,000 live births. It is caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the Neurofibromin 1 gene. Clinical manifestations are variable but may include hyperpigmented skin marks, hamartomas of the iris called Lisch nodules, neurofibromas, optic pathway gliomas and cognitive impairment. The prevalence of epilepsy is estimated to be 4\u20137%. Seizures are typically easier to control with anti-seizure medications relative to other phakomatoses but in some refractory cases surgery may need to be pursued.\nAcquired.\nEpilepsy may occur as a result of several other conditions, including tumors, strokes, head trauma, previous infections of the central nervous system, genetic abnormalities, and as a result of brain damage around the time of birth. Of those with brain tumors, almost 30% have epilepsy, making them the cause of about 4% of cases. The risk is greatest for tumors in the temporal lobe and those that grow slowly. Other mass lesions such as cerebral cavernous malformations and arteriovenous malformations have risks as high as 4060%. Of those who have had a stroke, 6\u201310% develop epilepsy. Risk factors for post-stroke epilepsy include stroke severity, cortical involvement, hemorrhage and early seizures.\u00a0Between 6 and 20% of epilepsy is believed to be due to head trauma. Mild brain injury increases the risk about two-fold while severe brain injury increases the risk seven-fold. In those who have experienced a high-powered gunshot wound to the head, the risk is about 50%.\nSome evidence links epilepsy and celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity, while other evidence does not. There appears to be a specific syndrome that includes coeliac disease, epilepsy, and calcifications in the brain. A 2012 review estimates that between 1% and 6% of people with epilepsy have coeliac disease while 1% of the general population has the condition.\nThe risk of epilepsy following meningitis is less than 10%; it more commonly causes seizures during the infection itself. In herpes simplex encephalitis the risk of a seizure is around 50% with a high risk of epilepsy following (up to 25%). A form of an infection with the pork tapeworm (cysticercosis), in the brain, is known as neurocysticercosis, and is the cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of the world where the parasite is common. Epilepsy may also occur after other brain infections such as cerebral malaria, toxoplasmosis, and toxocariasis. Chronic alcohol use increases the risk of epilepsy: those who drink six units of alcohol per day have a 2.5-fold increase in risk. Other risks include Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and autoimmune encephalitis. Getting vaccinated does not increase the risk of epilepsy. Malnutrition is a risk factor seen mostly in the developing world, although it is unclear however if it is a direct cause or an association. People with cerebral palsy have an increased risk of epilepsy, with half of people with spastic quadriplegia and spastic hemiplegia having the condition.\nMechanism.\nNormally brain electrical activity is non-synchronous, as large numbers of neurons do not normally fire at the same time, but rather fire in order as signals travel throughout the brain. Neuron activity is regulated by various factors both within the cell and the cellular environment. Factors within the neuron include the type, number and distribution of ion channels, changes to receptors and changes of gene expression. Factors around the neuron include ion concentrations, synaptic plasticity and regulation of transmitter breakdown by glial cells.\nEpilepsy.\nThe exact mechanism of epilepsy is unknown, but a little is known about its cellular and network mechanisms. However, it is unknown under which circumstances the brain shifts into the activity of a seizure with its excessive synchronization.\nIn epilepsy, the resistance of excitatory neurons to fire during this period is decreased. This may occur due to changes in ion channels or inhibitory neurons not functioning properly. This then results in a specific area from which seizures may develop, known as a \"seizure focus\". Another mechanism of epilepsy may be the up-regulation of excitatory circuits or down-regulation of inhibitory circuits following an injury to the brain. These secondary epilepsies occur through processes known as epileptogenesis. Failure of the blood\u2013brain barrier may also be a causal mechanism as it would allow substances in the blood to enter the brain.\nSeizures.\nThere is evidence that epileptic seizures are usually not a random event. Seizures are often brought on by factors (also known as triggers) such as stress, excessive alcohol use, flickering light, or a lack of sleep, among others. The term seizure threshold is used to indicate the amount of stimulus necessary to bring about a seizure; this threshold is lowered in epilepsy.\nIn epileptic seizures a group of neurons begin firing in an abnormal, excessive, and synchronized manner. This results in a wave of depolarization known as a paroxysmal depolarizing shift. Normally, after an excitatory neuron fires it becomes more resistant to firing for a period of time. This is due in part to the effect of inhibitory neurons, electrical changes within the excitatory neuron, and the negative effects of adenosine.\nFocal seizures begin in one area of the brain while generalized seizures begin in both hemispheres. Some types of seizures may change brain structure, while others appear to have little effect. Gliosis, neuronal loss, and atrophy of specific areas of the brain are linked to epilepsy but it is unclear if epilepsy causes these changes or if these changes result in epilepsy.\nThe seizures can be described on different scales, from the cellular level to the whole brain. These are several concomitant factor, which on different scale can \"drive\" the brain to pathological states and trigger a seizure.\nDiagnosis.\nThe diagnosis of epilepsy is typically made based on observation of the seizure onset and the underlying cause. An electroencephalogram (EEG) to look for abnormal patterns of brain waves and neuroimaging (CT scan or MRI) to look at the structure of the brain are also usually part of the initial investigations. While figuring out a specific epileptic syndrome is often attempted, it is not always possible. Video and EEG monitoring may be useful in difficult cases.\nDefinition.\nEpilepsy is a disorder of the brain defined by any of the following conditions:\nFurthermore, epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who had an age-dependent epilepsy syndrome but are now past that age or those who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years.\nThis 2014 definition of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) is a clarification of the ILAE 2005 conceptual definition, according to which epilepsy is \"a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiologic, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The definition of epilepsy requires the occurrence of at least one epileptic seizure.\"\nIt is, therefore, possible to outgrow epilepsy or to undergo treatment that causes epilepsy to be resolved, but with no guarantee that it will not return. In the definition, epilepsy is now called a disease, rather than a disorder. This was a decision of the executive committee of the ILAE, taken because the word \"disorder\", while perhaps having less stigma than does \"disease\", also does not express the degree of seriousness that epilepsy deserves.\nThe definition is practical in nature and is designed for clinical use. In particular, it aims to clarify when an \"enduring predisposition\" according to the 2005 conceptual definition is present. Researchers, statistically minded epidemiologists, and other specialized groups may choose to use the older definition or a definition of their own devising. The ILAE considers doing so is perfectly allowable, so long as it is clear what definition is being used.\nThe ILAE definition for one seizure needs an understanding of projecting an \"enduring predisposition\" to the generation of epileptic seizures. WHO, for instance, chooses to just use the traditional definition of two unprovoked seizures.\nClassification.\nIn contrast to the classification of seizures which focuses on what happens during a seizure, the classification of epilepsies focuses on the underlying causes. When a person is admitted to hospital after an epileptic seizure the diagnostic workup results preferably in the seizure itself being classified (e.g. tonic-clonic) and in the underlying disease being identified (e.g. hippocampal sclerosis). The name of the diagnosis finally made depends on the available diagnostic results and the applied definitions and classifications (of seizures and epilepsies) and its respective terminology.\nThe International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) provided a classification of the epilepsies and epileptic syndromes in 1989 as follows:\nThis classification was widely accepted but has also been criticized mainly because the underlying causes of epilepsy (which are a major determinant of clinical course and prognosis) were not covered in detail. In 2010 the ILAE Commission for Classification of the Epilepsies addressed this issue and divided epilepsies into three categories (genetic, structural/metabolic, unknown cause) which were refined in their 2011 recommendation into four categories and a number of subcategories reflecting recent technological and scientific advances.\nSyndromes.\nCases of epilepsy may be organized into epilepsy syndromes by the specific features that are present. These features include the age that seizures begin, the seizure types, EEG findings, among others. Identifying an epilepsy syndrome is useful as it helps determine the underlying causes as well as what anti-seizure medication should be tried.\nThe ability to categorize a case of epilepsy into a specific syndrome occurs more often with children since the onset of seizures is commonly early. Less serious examples are benign rolandic epilepsy (2.8 per 100,000), childhood absence epilepsy (0.8 per 100,000) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (0.7 per 100,000). Severe syndromes with diffuse brain dysfunction caused, at least partly, by some aspect of epilepsy, are also referred to as developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. These are associated with frequent seizures that are resistant to treatment and cognitive dysfunction, for instance Lennox\u2013Gastaut syndrome (1\u20132% of all persons with epilepsy), Dravet syndrome (1: 15,000-40,000 worldwide), and West syndrome (1\u20139: 100,000). Genetics is believed to play an important role in epilepsies by a number of mechanisms. Simple and complex modes of inheritance have been identified for some of them. However, extensive screening have failed to identify many single gene variants of large effect. More recent exome and genome sequencing studies have begun to reveal a number of de novo gene mutations that are responsible for some epileptic encephalopathies, including CHD2 and SYNGAP1 and DNM1, GABBR2, FASN and RYR3.\nSyndromes in which causes are not clearly identified are difficult to match with categories of the current classification of epilepsy. Categorization for these cases was made somewhat arbitrarily. The \"idiopathic\" (unknown cause) category of the 2011 classification includes syndromes in which the general clinical features and/or age specificity strongly point to a presumed genetic cause. Some childhood epilepsy syndromes are included in the unknown cause category in which the cause is presumed genetic, for instance benign rolandic epilepsy. Clinical syndromes in which epilepsy is not the main feature (e.g. Angelman syndrome) were categorized \"symptomatic\" but it was argued to include these within the category \"idiopathic\". Classification of epilepsies and particularly of epilepsy syndromes will change with advances in research.\nTests.\nAn electroencephalogram (EEG) can assist in showing brain activity suggestive of an increased risk of seizures. It is only recommended for those who are likely to have had an epileptic seizure on the basis of symptoms. In the diagnosis of epilepsy, electroencephalography may help distinguish the type of seizure or syndrome present. In children it is typically only needed after a second seizure unless specified by a specialist. It cannot be used to rule out the diagnosis and may be falsely positive in those without the condition. In certain situations it may be useful to perform the EEG while the affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived.\nDiagnostic imaging by CT scan and MRI is recommended after a first non-febrile seizure to detect structural problems in and around the brain. MRI is generally a better imaging test except when bleeding is suspected, for which CT is more sensitive and more easily available. If someone attends the emergency room with a seizure but returns to normal quickly, imaging tests may be done at a later point. If a person has a previous diagnosis of epilepsy with previous imaging, repeating the imaging is usually not needed even if there are subsequent seizures.\nFor adults, the testing of electrolyte, blood glucose and calcium levels is important to rule out problems with these as causes. An electrocardiogram can rule out problems with the rhythm of the heart. A lumbar puncture may be useful to diagnose a central nervous system infection but is not routinely needed. In children additional tests may be required such as urine biochemistry and blood testing looking for metabolic disorders. Together with EEG and neuroimaging, genetic testing is becoming one of the most important diagnostic technique for epilepsy, as a diagnosis might be achieved in a relevant proportion of cases with severe epilepsies, both in children and adults. For those with negative genetic testing, in some it might be important to repeat or re-analyze previous genetic studies after 2\u20133 years.\nA high blood prolactin level within the first 20 minutes following a seizure may be useful to help confirm an epileptic seizure as opposed to psychogenic non-epileptic seizure. Serum prolactin level is less useful for detecting focal seizures. If it is normal an epileptic seizure is still possible and a serum prolactin does not separate epileptic seizures from syncope. It is not recommended as a routine part of the diagnosis of epilepsy.\nDifferential diagnosis.\nDiagnosis of epilepsy can be difficult. A number of other conditions may present very similar signs and symptoms to seizures, including syncope, hyperventilation, migraines, narcolepsy, panic attacks and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). In particular, syncope can be accompanied by a short episode of convulsions. Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, often misdiagnosed as nightmares, was considered to be a parasomnia but later identified to be an epilepsy syndrome. Attacks of the movement disorder paroxysmal dyskinesia may be taken for epileptic seizures. The cause of a drop attack can be, among many others, an atonic seizure.\nChildren may have behaviors that are easily mistaken for epileptic seizures but are not. These include breath-holding spells, bedwetting, night terrors, tics and shudder attacks. Gastroesophageal reflux may cause arching of the back and twisting of the head to the side in infants, which may be mistaken for tonic-clonic seizures.\nMisdiagnosis is frequent (occurring in about 5 to 30% of cases). Different studies showed that in many cases seizure-like attacks in apparent treatment-resistant epilepsy have a cardiovascular cause. Approximately 20% of the people seen at epilepsy clinics have PNES and of those who have PNES about 10% also have epilepsy; separating the two based on the seizure episode alone without further testing is often difficult.\nPrevention.\nWhile many cases are not preventable, efforts to reduce head injuries, provide good care around the time of birth, and reduce environmental parasites such as the pork tapeworm may be effective. After brain injuries, there is a limited window of time to intervene with treatments to prevent epilepsy, similar to the therapeutic approach used in stroke therapy. Epileptogenesis may occur rapidly, further narrowing this window, but a delayed process known as \"secondary epileptogenesis\" can influence the progression and severity of epilepsy, offering opportunities for intervention even after its onset. Current research focuses on identifying methods and targets to prevent or slow epilepsy development. Promising treatments include drugs such as TrkB inhibitors, losartan, statins, isoflurane, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative drugs, the SV2A modulator levetiracetam, and epigenetic interventions. Efforts in one part of Central America to decrease rates of pork tapeworm resulted in a 50% decrease in new cases of epilepsy. Yoga-based Nadi Shodhana Pranayama, also known as Alternate Nostril Breathing, may positively impact the nervous system and help manage seizure disorders. Regular exercise helps balance brain function by providing the body with oxygen and removing carbon dioxide and toxins from the blood.\nComplications.\nEpilepsy can be dangerous when seizure occurs at certain times. The risk of drowning or being involved in a motor vehicle collision is higher. It is also found that people with epilepsy are more likely to have psychological problems. Other complications include aspiration pneumonia and difficulty learning.\nManagement.\nEpilepsy is usually treated with daily medication once a second seizure has occurred, while medication may be started after the first seizure in those at high risk for subsequent seizures. Supporting people's self-management of their condition may be useful. In drug-resistant cases different management options may be considered, including special diets, the implantation of a neurostimulator, or neurosurgery.\nFirst aid.\nRolling people with an active tonic-clonic seizure onto their side and into the recovery position helps prevent fluids from getting into the lungs. Putting fingers, a bite block or tongue depressor in the mouth is not recommended as it might make the person vomit or result in the rescuer being bitten. Efforts should be taken to prevent further self-injury. Spinal precautions are generally not needed.\nIf a seizure lasts longer than 5\u00a0minutes or if there are more than two seizures in 5 minutes without a return to a normal level of consciousness between them, it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus. This may require medical help to keep the airway open and protected; a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this. At home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in the nose or mouth. Diazepam may also be used rectally. In hospital, intravenous lorazepam is preferred.\nIf two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective, other medications such as phenytoin are recommended. Convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to the intensive care unit and treatment with stronger agents such as midazolam infusion, ketamine, thiopentone or propofol. Most institutions have a preferred pathway or protocol to be used in a seizure emergency like status epilepticus. These protocols have been found to be effective in reducing time to delivery of treatment.\nMedications.\nThe mainstay treatment of epilepsy is anticonvulsant medications, possibly for the person's entire life. The choice of anticonvulsant is based on seizure type, epilepsy syndrome, other medications used, other health problems, and the person's age and lifestyle. A single medication is recommended initially; if this is not effective, switching to a single other medication is recommended. Two medications at once is recommended only if a single medication does not work. In about half, the first agent is effective; a second single agent helps in about 13% and a third or two agents at the same time may help an additional 4%. About 30% of people continue to have seizures despite anticonvulsant treatment.\nThere are a number of medications available including phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate. Evidence suggests that phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproate may be equally effective in both focal and generalized seizures. Controlled release carbamazepine appears to work as well as immediate release carbamazepine, and may have fewer side effects. In the United Kingdom, carbamazepine or lamotrigine are recommended as first-line treatment for focal seizures, with levetiracetam and valproate as second-line due to issues of cost and side effects. Valproate is recommended first-line for generalized seizures with lamotrigine being second-line. In those with absence seizures, ethosuximide or valproate are recommended; valproate is particularly effective in myoclonic seizures and tonic or atonic seizures. If seizures are well-controlled on a particular treatment, it is not usually necessary to routinely check the medication levels in the blood.\nThe least expensive anticonvulsant is phenobarbital at around US$5 a year. The World Health Organization gives it a first-line recommendation in the developing world and it is commonly used there. Access, however, may be difficult as some countries label it as a controlled drug.\nAdverse effects from medications are reported in 10% to 90% of people, depending on how and from whom the data is collected. Most adverse effects are dose-related and mild. Some examples include mood changes, sleepiness, or an unsteadiness in gait. Certain medications have side effects that are not related to dose such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow. Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects. Some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy. Many of the common used medications, such as valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and gabapentin have been reported to cause increased risk of birth defects, especially when used during the first trimester. Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the medications. Among the antiepileptic medications, levetiracetam and lamotrigine seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects.\nSlowly stopping medications may be reasonable in some people who do not have a seizure for two to four years; however, around a third of people have a recurrence, most often during the first six months. Stopping is possible in about 70% of children and 60% of adults. Measuring medication levels is not generally needed in those whose seizures are well controlled.\nSurgery.\nEpilepsy surgery should be considered for any person with epilepsy who is medically refractory. People with epilepsy are evaluated on a case-by-case basis in centres that are familiar with and have expertise in epilepsy surgery. Results from a 2023 systematic review found that surgical interventions for children aged 1\u201336 months with drug-resistant epilepsy can lead to significant seizure reduction or freedom, especially when other treatments have failed. Epilepsy surgery may be an option for people with focal seizures that remain a problem despite other treatments. These other treatments include at least a trial of two or three medications. The goal of surgery has been total control of seizures. However, most physicians believe that even palliative surgery where the burden of seizures is reduced significantly can help in achieving developmental progress or reversal of developmental stagnation in children with drug-resistant epilepsy and this may be achieved in 60\u201370% of cases. Common procedures include cutting out the hippocampus via an anterior temporal lobe resection, removal of tumors, and removing parts of the neocortex. Some procedures such as a corpus callosotomy are attempted in an effort to decrease the number of seizures rather than cure the condition. Following surgery, medications may be slowly withdrawn in many cases.\nNeurostimulation.\nNeurostimulation via neuro-cybernetic prosthesis implantation may be another option in those who are not candidates for surgery, providing chronic, pulsatile electrical stimulation of specific nerve or brain regions, alongside standard care. Three types of neurotherapy have been used in those who do not respond to medications: vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), anterior thalamic stimulation, and closed-loop responsive stimulation (RNS).\nVagus nerve stimulation.\nNon-pharmacological modulation of neurotransmitters via high-level VNS (h-VNS) may reduce seizure frequency in children and adults who do not respond to medical and/or surgical therapy, when compared with low-level VNS (l-VNS). In a 2022 Cochrane review of four randomized controlled trials, with moderate certainty of evidence, people receiving h-VNS treatment were 73% more likely (13% more likely to 164% more likely) to experience a reduction in seizure frequency by at least 50% (the minimum threshold defined for individual clinical response). Potentially 249 (163 to 380) per 1000 people with drug-resistant epilepsy may achieve a 50% reduction in seizures following h-VNS, benefiting an additional 105 per 1000 people compared with l-VNS.\nThis outcome was limited by the number of studies available, and the quality of one trial in particular, wherein three people received l-VNS in error. A sensitivity analysis suggested that the best case scenario was that the likelihood of clinical response to h-VNS may be 91% (27% to 189%) higher than those receiving l-VNS. In the worst-case scenario, the likelihood of clinical response to h-VNS was still 61% higher (7% higher to 143% higher) than l-VNS.\nDespite the potential benefit for h-VNS treatment, the Cochrane review also found that the risk of several adverse-effects was greater than those receiving l-VNS. There was moderate certainty of evidence that voice alteration or hoarseness risk may be 2.17(1.49 to 3.17) fold higher than people receiving l-VNS. Dyspnoea risk was also 2.45 (1.07 to 5.60) times that of l-VNS recipients, although the low number of events and studies meant that the certainty of evidence was low. The risk of rebound-withdrawal symptoms, coughing, pain and paraesthesia was unclear.\nDiet.\nThere is promising evidence that a ketogenic diet (high-fat, low-carbohydrate, adequate-protein) decreases the number of seizures and eliminates seizures in some; however, further research is necessary. A 2022 systematic review of the literature has found some evidence to support that a ketogenic diet or modified Atkins diet can be helpful in the treatment of epilepsy in some infants. These types of diets may be beneficial for children with drug-resistant epilepsy; the use for adults remains uncertain. The most commonly reported adverse effects were vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea. It is unclear why this diet works. In people with coeliac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity and occipital calcifications, a gluten-free diet may decrease the frequency of seizures.\nOther.\nAvoidance therapy consists of minimizing or eliminating triggers. For example, those who are sensitive to light may have success with using a small television, avoiding video games, or wearing dark glasses. Operant-based biofeedback based on the EEG waves has some support in those who do not respond to medications. Psychological methods should not, however, be used to replace medications.\nExercise has been proposed as possibly useful for preventing seizures, with some data to support this claim. Some dogs, commonly referred to as seizure dogs, may help during or after a seizure. It is not clear if dogs have the ability to predict seizures before they occur.\nThere is moderate-quality evidence supporting the use of psychological interventions along with other treatments in epilepsy. This can improve quality of life, enhance emotional wellbeing, and reduce fatigue in adults and adolescents. Psychological interventions may also improve seizure control for some individuals by promoting self-management and adherence.\nAs an add-on therapy in those who are not well controlled with other medications, cannabidiol appears to be useful in some children. In 2018 the FDA approved this product for Lennox\u2013Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome.\nThere are a few studies on the use of dexamethasone for the successful treatment of drug-resistant seizures in both adults and children.\nAlternative medicine.\nAlternative medicine, including acupuncture, routine vitamins, and yoga, have no reliable evidence to support their use in epilepsy. Melatonin, , is insufficiently supported by evidence. The trials were of poor methodological quality and it was not possible to draw any definitive conclusions.\nSeveral supplements (with varied reliabilities of evidence) have been reported to be helpful for drug-resistant epilepsy. These include high-dose Omega-3, berberine, Manuka honey, reishi and lion's mane mushrooms, curcumin, vitamin E, coenzyme Q-10, and resveratrol. The reason these can work (in theory) is that they reduce inflammation or oxidative stress, two of the major mechanism contributing to epilepsy.\nContraception and pregnancy.\nWomen of child-bearing age, including those with epilepsy, are at risk of unintended pregnancies if they are not using an effective form of contraception. Women with epilepsy may experience a temporary increase in seizure frequency when they begin hormonal contraception.\nSome anti-seizure medications interact with enzymes in the liver and cause the drugs in hormonal contraception to be broken down more quickly. These enzyme inducing drugs make hormonal contraception less effective, and this is particularly hazardous if the anti-seizure medication is associated with birth defects. Potent enzyme-inducing anti-seizure medications include carbamazepine, eslicarbazepine acetate, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, and rufinamide. The drugs perampanel and topiramate can be enzyme-inducing at higher doses. Conversely, hormonal contraception can lower the amount of the anti-seizure medication lamotrigine circulating in the body, making it less effective. The failure rate of oral contraceptives, when used correctly, is 1%, but this increases to between 3\u20136% in women with epilepsy. Overall, intrauterine devices (IUDs) are preferred for women with epilepsy who are not intending to become pregnant.\nWomen with epilepsy, especially if they have other medical conditions, may have a slightly lower, but still high, chance of becoming pregnant. Women with infertility have about the same chance of success with in vitro fertilisation or other forms of assisted reproductive technology as women without epilepsy. There may be a higher risk of pregnancy loss.\nOnce pregnant, there are two main concerns related to pregnancy. The first concern is about the risk of seizures during pregnancy, and the second concern is that the anti-seizure medications may result in birth defects. Most women with epilepsy must continue treatment with anti-seizure drugs, and the treatment goal is to balance the need to prevent seizures with the need to prevent drug-induced birth defects.\nPregnancy does not seem to change seizure frequency very much. When seizures happen, however, they can cause some pregnancy complications, such as pre-term births or the babies being smaller than usual when they are born.\nAll pregnancies have a risk of birth defects, e.g., due to smoking during pregnancy. In addition to this typical level of risk, some anti-seizure drugs significantly increase the risk of birth defects and intrauterine growth restriction, as well as developmental, neurocognitive, and behavioral disorders. Most women with epilepsy receive safe and effective treatment and have typical, healthy children. The highest risks are associated with specific anti-seizure drugs, such as valproic acid and carbamazepine, and with higher doses. Folic acid supplementation, such as through prenatal vitamins, reduced the risk. Planning pregnancies in advance gives women with epilepsy an opportunity to switch to a lower-risk treatment program and reduced drug doses.\nAlthough anti-seizure drugs can be found in breast milk, women with epilepsy can breastfeed their babies, and the benefits usually outweigh the risks.\nPrognosis.\nEpilepsy cannot usually be cured, but medication can control seizures effectively in about 70% of cases. Of those with generalized seizures, more than 80% can be well controlled with medications while this is true in only 50% of people with focal seizures. One predictor of long-term outcome is the number of seizures that occur in the first six months. Other factors increasing the risk of a poor outcome include little response to the initial treatment, generalized seizures, a family history of epilepsy, psychiatric problems, and waves on the EEG representing generalized epileptiform activity. According to the ILAE epilepsy is considered to be resolved if an individual with epilepsy is seizure free for 10 years and off anticonvulsant for 5 years.\nIn the developing world, 75% of people are either untreated or not appropriately treated. In Africa, 90% do not get treatment. This is partly related to appropriate medications not being available or being too expensive.\nMortality.\nPeople with epilepsy may have a higher risk of premature death compared to those without the condition. This risk is estimated to be between 1.6 and 4.1 times greater than that of the general population. The greatest increase in mortality from epilepsy is among the elderly. Those with epilepsy due to an unknown cause have a relatively low increase in risk.\nMortality is often related to the underlying cause of the seizures, status epilepticus, suicide, trauma, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Death from status epilepticus is primarily due to an underlying problem rather than missing doses of medications. The risk of suicide is between two and six times higher in those with epilepsy; the cause of this is unclear. SUDEP appears to be partly related to the frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and accounts for about 15% of epilepsy-related deaths; it is unclear how to decrease its risk.\nRisk factors for SUDEP include nocturnal generalized tonic-clonic seizures, seizures, sleeping alone and medically intractable epilepsy.\nIn the United Kingdom, it is estimated that 40\u201360% of deaths are possibly preventable. In the developing world, many deaths are due to untreated epilepsy leading to falls or status epilepticus.\nEpidemiology.\nEpilepsy is one of the most common serious neurological disorders affecting about 50\u00a0million people . It affects 1% of the population by age 20 and 3% of the population by age 75. It is more common in males than females with the overall difference being small. Most of those with the disorder (80%) are in low income populations or the developing world.\nThe estimated prevalence of active epilepsy () is in the range 3\u201310 per 1,000, with active epilepsy defined as someone with epilepsy who has had at least one unprovoked seizure in the last five years. Epilepsy begins each year in 40\u201370 per 100,000 in developed countries and 80\u2013140 per 100,000 in developing countries. Poverty is a risk and includes both being from a poor country and being poor relative to others within one's country. In the developed world epilepsy most commonly starts either in the young or in the old. In the developing world its onset is more common in older children and young adults due to the higher rates of trauma and infectious diseases. In developed countries the number of cases a year has decreased in children and increased among the elderly between the 1970s and 2003. This has been attributed partly to better survival following strokes in the elderly.\nHistory.\nThe oldest medical records show that epilepsy has been affecting people at least since the beginning of recorded history. Throughout ancient history, the condition was thought to be of a spiritual cause. The world's oldest description of an epileptic seizure comes from a text in Akkadian (a language used in ancient Mesopotamia) and was written around 2000 BC. The person described in the text was diagnosed as being under the influence of a moon god, and underwent an exorcism. Epileptic seizures are listed in the Code of Hammurabi () as reason for which a purchased slave may be returned for a refund, and the Edwin Smith Papyrus () describes cases of individuals with epileptic convulsions.\nThe oldest known detailed record of the condition itself is in the \"Sakikku\", a Babylonian cuneiform medical text from 10671046 BC. This text gives signs and symptoms, details treatment and likely outcomes, and describes many features of the different seizure types. As the Babylonians had no biomedical understanding of the nature of epilepsy, they attributed the seizures to possession by evil spirits and called for treating the condition through spiritual means. Around 900 BC, Punarvasu Atreya described epilepsy as loss of consciousness; this definition was carried forward into the Ayurvedic text of Charaka Samhita ().\nThe ancient Greeks had contradictory views of the condition. They thought of epilepsy as a form of spiritual possession, but also associated the condition with genius and the divine. One of the names they gave to it was the \"sacred disease\" (). Epilepsy appears within Greek mythology: it is associated with the Moon goddesses Selene and Artemis, who afflicted those who upset them. The Greeks thought that important figures such as Julius Caesar and Hercules had the condition. The notable exception to this divine and spiritual view was that of the school of Hippocrates. In the fifth century BC, Hippocrates rejected the idea that the condition was caused by spirits. In his landmark work \"On the Sacred Disease\", he proposed that epilepsy was not divine in origin and instead was a medically treatable problem originating in the brain. He accused those of attributing a sacred cause to the condition of spreading ignorance through a belief in superstitious magic. Hippocrates proposed that heredity was important as a cause, described worse outcomes if the condition presents at an early age, and made note of the physical characteristics as well as the social shame associated with it. Instead of referring to it as the \"sacred disease\", he used the term \"great disease\", giving rise to the modern term \"grand mal\", used for tonic\u2013clonic seizures. Despite his work detailing the physical origins of the condition, his view was not accepted at the time. Evil spirits continued to be blamed until at least the 17th century.\nIn Ancient Rome people did not eat or drink with the same pottery as that used by someone who was affected. People of the time would spit on their chest believing that this would keep the problem from affecting them. According to Apuleius and other ancient physicians, to detect epilepsy, it was common to light a piece of \"gagates\", whose smoke would trigger the seizure. Occasionally a spinning potter's wheel was used, perhaps a reference to photosensitive epilepsy.\nIn most cultures, persons with epilepsy have been stigmatized, shunned, or even imprisoned. As late as in the second half of the 20th century, in Tanzania and other parts of Africa epilepsy was associated with possession by evil spirits, witchcraft, or poisoning and was believed by many to be contagious. In the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, the birthplace of modern neurology, Jean-Martin Charcot found people with epilepsy side by side with the mentally ill, those with chronic syphilis, and the criminally insane. In Ancient Rome, epilepsy was known as the or 'disease of the assembly hall' and was seen as a curse from the gods. In northern Italy, epilepsy was traditionally known as Saint Valentine's malady. In at least the 1840s in the United States of America, epilepsy was known as the \"falling sickness\" or \"the falling fits\", and was considered a form of medical insanity. Around the same time period, epilepsy was known in France as the , , , , and . People of epilepsy in France were also known as , due to the seizures and loss of consciousness in an epileptic episode.\nIn the mid-19th century, the first effective anti-seizure medication, bromide, was introduced. The first modern treatment, phenobarbital, was developed in 1912, with phenytoin coming into use in 1938.\nSociety and culture.\nStigma.\nSocial stigma is commonly experienced, around the world, by those with epilepsy. It can affect people economically, socially and culturally. In India and China, epilepsy may be used as justification to deny marriage. People in some areas still believe those with epilepsy to be cursed. In parts of Africa, such as Tanzania and Uganda, epilepsy is claimed to be associated with possession by evil spirits, witchcraft, or poisoning and is incorrectly believed by many to be contagious. Before 1971 in the United Kingdom, epilepsy was considered grounds for the annulment of marriage. The stigma may result in some people with epilepsy denying that they have ever had seizures. A 2024 cross-sectional study revealed that 64.8% of relatives of epilepsy patients experienced moderate stigma and held moderately positive attitudes toward epilepsy. The study found that higher levels of stigma among participants were associated with more negative attitudes toward the condition. Additionally, relatives of patients who experienced frequent seizures (one or more per month) faced greater stigma, while those of patients who did not adhere to their medication regimen exhibited more negative attitudes toward epilepsy.\nEconomics.\nSeizures result in direct economic costs of about one billion dollars in the United States. Epilepsy resulted in economic costs in Europe of around 15.5\u00a0billion euros in 2004. In India epilepsy is estimated to result in costs of US$1.7\u00a0billion or 0.5% of the GDP. It is the cause of about 1% of emergency department visits (2% for emergency departments for children) in the United States.\nVehicles.\nThose with epilepsy are at about twice the risk of being involved in a motor vehicular collision and thus in many areas of the world are not allowed to drive or only able to drive if certain conditions are met. Diagnostic delay has been suggested to be a cause of some potentially avoidable motor vehicle collisions since at least one study showed that most motor vehicle accidents occurred in those with undiagnosed non-motor seizures as opposed to those with motor seizures at epilepsy onset. In some places physicians are required by law to report if a person has had a seizure to the licensing body while in others the requirement is only that they encourage the person in question to report it themselves. Countries that require physician reporting include Sweden, Austria, Denmark and Spain. Countries that require the individual to report include the UK and New Zealand, and physicians may report if they believe the individual has not already. In Canada, the United States and Australia the requirements around reporting vary by province or state. If seizures are well controlled most feel allowing driving is reasonable. The amount of time a person must be free from seizures before they can drive varies by country. Many countries require one to three years without seizures. In the United States the time needed without a seizure is determined by each state and is between three months and one year.\nThose with epilepsy or seizures are typically denied a pilot license.\nSupport organizations.\nThere are organizations that provide support for people and families affected by epilepsy. The \"Out of the Shadows\" campaign, a joint effort by the World Health Organization, the ILAE and the International Bureau for Epilepsy, provides help internationally. In the United States, the Epilepsy Foundation is a national organization that works to increase the acceptance of those with the disorder, their ability to function in society and to promote research for a cure. The Epilepsy Foundation, some hospitals, and some individuals also run support groups in the United States. In Australia, the Epilepsy Foundation provides support, delivers education and training and funds research for people living with epilepsy.\nInternational Epilepsy Day (World Epilepsy Day) began in 2015 and occurs on the second Monday in February.\nPurple Day, a different world-wide epilepsy awareness day for epilepsy, was initiated by a nine-year-old Canadian named Cassidy Megan in 2008, and is every year on 26 March.\nResearch.\nSeizure prediction and modeling.\nSeizure prediction refers to attempts to forecast epileptic seizures based on the EEG before they occur. , no effective mechanism to predict seizures has been developed. Although no effective device that can predict seizures is available, the science behind seizure prediction and ability to deliver such a tool has made progress.\nKindling, where repeated exposures to events that could cause seizures eventually causes seizures more easily, has been used to create animal models of epilepsy.\nDifferent animal models of epilepsy have been characterized in rodents that recapitulate the EEG and behavioral concomitants of different forms of epilepsy, in particular the occurrence of recurrent spontaneous seizures. Because epileptic seizures of different kinds are observed naturally in some of these animals, strains of mice and rats have been selected to be used as genetic models of epilepsy. In particular, several lines of mice and rats display spike-and-wave discharges when EEG recorded and have been studied to understand absence epilepsy. Among these models, the strain of GAERS (Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg) was characterized in the 1980s and has helped to understand the mechanisms underlying childhood absence epilepsy.\nRat brain slices serve as a valuable model for assessing the potential of compounds in reducing epileptiform activity. By evaluating the frequency of epileptiform bursting in hippocampal networks, researchers can identify promising candidates for novel anti-seizure drugs.\nReductionist views on the mechanisms of epileptiform discharges are often expressed through mathematical models. The simplest of these models are based on a few ordinary differential equations, such as the Epileptor model. The more physiologically explicit Epileptor-2 model replicates brief interictal discharges\u2014observed as clusters of action potential spikes in the activity of individual neurons\u2014and longer ictal discharges, represented as clusters of these shorter discharges. According to this model, brief interictal discharges are characterized as stochastic oscillations of the membrane potential and synaptic resources, while ictal discharges emerge as oscillations in the extracellular concentration of potassium ions and the intracellular concentration of sodium ions. These models demonstrate that ionic dynamics play a decisive role in the generation of pathological activity.\nOne of the hypotheses present in the literature is based on inflammatory pathways. Studies supporting this mechanism revealed that inflammatory, glycolipid, and oxidative factors are higher in people with epilepsy, especially those with generalized epilepsy.\nPotential future therapies.\nGene therapy is being studied in some types of epilepsy. Medications that alter immune function, such as intravenous immunoglobulins, may reduce the frequency of seizures when including in normal care as an add-on therapy; however, further research is required to determine whether these medications are very well tolerated in children and in adults with epilepsy. Noninvasive stereotactic radiosurgery is, , being compared to standard surgery for certain types of epilepsy.\nOther animals.\nEpilepsy occurs in a number of other animals including dogs and cats; it is in fact the most common brain disorder in dogs. It is typically treated with anticonvulsants such as levetiracetam, phenobarbital, or bromide in dogs and phenobarbital in cats. Imepitoin is also used in dogs. While generalized seizures in horses are fairly easy to diagnose, it may be more difficult in non-generalized seizures and EEGs may be useful. Juvenile idiopathic epilepsy (JIE) in foals is a condition with varying outcomes, depending on the severity and management of the condition. Some foals eventually outgrow the condition without significant long-term effects, while others may face severe consequences, including death or lifelong complications, if left untreated. This variability highlights the importance of timely intervention and care. Earlier research has pointed to a significant genetic influence in the development of JIE, suggesting that the condition may follow the inheritance pattern of a single-gene trait. These findings underscore the need for further genetic studies to confirm this hypothesis and explore potential breeding strategies to reduce the prevalence of JIE."}

The term was adopted by Duke University botanist J. B. Rhine to denote psychic abilities such as intuition, telepathy, psychometry, clairvoyance, clairaudience, clairsentience, empathy and their trans-temporal operation as precognition or retrocognition.\nSecond sight is an alleged form of extrasensory perception, whereby a person perceives information, in the form of a vision, about future events before they happen (precognition), or about things or events at remote locations (remote viewing). There is no evidence that second sight exists. Reports of second sight are known only from anecdotes. Second sight and ESP are classified as pseudosciences.\nHistory.\nIn the 1930s, at Duke University in North Carolina, J. B. Rhine and his wife Louisa E. Rhine conducted an investigation into extrasensory perception. While Louisa Rhine concentrated on collecting accounts of spontaneous cases, J. B. Rhine worked largely in the laboratory, carefully defining terms such as ESP and \"psi\" and designing experiments to test them. A simple set of black and white cards was developed, originally called Zener cards \u2013 now called ESP cards. They bear the symbols circle, square, wavy lines, cross, and star. There are five of each type of card in a pack of 25.\nIn a telepathy experiment, the \"sender\" looks at a series of cards while the \"receiver\" guesses the symbols. To try to observe clairvoyance, the pack of cards is hidden from everyone while the receiver guesses. To try to observe precognition, the order of the cards is determined after the guesses are made. Later he used dice to test for psychokinesis.\nThe parapsychology experiments at Duke evoked criticism from academics and others who challenged the concepts and evidence of ESP. A number of psychological departments attempted, unsuccessfully, to repeat Rhine's experiments. W. S. Cox (1936) from Princeton University with 132 subjects produced 25,064 trials in a playing card ESP experiment. Cox concluded \"There is no evidence of extrasensory perception either in the 'average man' or of the group investigated or in any particular individual of that group. The discrepancy between these results and those obtained by Rhine is due either to uncontrollable factors in experimental procedure or to the difference in the subjects.\" Four other psychological departments failed to replicate Rhine's results.\nIn 1938, the psychologist Joseph Jastrow wrote that much of the evidence for extrasensory perception collected by Rhine and other parapsychologists was anecdotal, biased, dubious and the result of \"faulty observation and familiar human frailties\". Rhine's experiments were discredited due to the discovery that sensory leakage or cheating could account for all his results such as the subject being able to read the symbols from the back of the cards and being able to see and hear the experimenter to note subtle clues.\nIn the 1960s, parapsychologists became increasingly interested in the cognitive components of ESP, the subjective experience involved in making ESP responses, and the role of ESP in psychological life. This called for experimental procedures that were not limited to Rhine's favored forced-choice methodology. Such procedures have included dream telepathy experiments, and the ganzfeld experiments (a mild sensory deprivation procedure).\nSecond sight may have originally been so called because normal vision was regarded as coming first, while supernormal vision is a secondary thing, confined to certain individuals. \"An d\u00e0 shealladh\" or \"the two sights\", meaning \"the sight of the seer\", is the way Gaels refer to \"second sight\", the involuntary ability of seeing the future or distant events. There are many Gaelic words for the various aspects of second sight, but \"an d\u00e0 shealladh\" is the one mostly recognized by non-Gaelic speakers, even though, strictly speaking, it does not really mean second sight, but rather \"two sights\".\nSkepticism.\nParapsychology is the study of paranormal psychic phenomena, including ESP. Parapsychology has been criticized for continuing investigation despite being unable to provide convincing evidence for the existence of any psychic phenomena after more than a century of research. The scientific community rejects ESP due to the absence of an evidence base, the lack of a theory which would explain ESP and the lack of positive experimental results; it considers ESP to be pseudoscience.\nThe scientific consensus does not view extrasensory perception as a scientific phenomenon. Skeptics have pointed out that there is no viable theory to explain the mechanism behind ESP, and that there are historical cases in which flaws have been discovered in the experimental design of parapsychological studies.\nThere are many criticisms pertaining to experiments involving extrasensory perception, particularly surrounding methodological flaws. These flaws are not unique to a single experimental design, and are effective in discrediting much of the positive research surrounding ESP. Many of the flaws seen in the Zener cards experiment are present in the Ganzfeld experiment as well. First is the stacking effect, an error that occurs in ESP research. Trial-by-trial feedback given in studies using a \"closed\" ESP target sequence (e.g., a deck of cards) violates the condition of independence used for most standard statistical tests. Multiple responses for a single target cannot be evaluated using statistical tests that assume independence of responses. This increases the likelihood of card counting and, in turn, increases the chances for the subject to guess correctly without using ESP. Another methodological flaw involves cues through sensory leakage, for example, when the subject receives a visual cue. This could be the reflection of a Zener card in the holder's glasses. In this case, the subject is able to guess the card correctly because they can see it in the reflection, not because of ESP. Finally, poor randomization of target stimuli could be happening. Poor shuffling methods can make the orders of the cards easier to predict, or the cards could have been marked and manipulated, again, making it easier to predict which cards come next. The results of a meta-analysis found that when these errors were corrected and accounted for, there was still no significant effect of ESP. Many of the studies only appeared to have significant occurrence of ESP, when in fact, this result was due to the many methodological errors in the research.\nDermo-optical perception.\nIn the early 20th century, Joaquin Mar\u00eda Argamasilla, known as the \"Spaniard with X-ray Eyes\", claimed to be able to read handwriting or numbers on dice through closed metal boxes. Argamasilla managed to fool Gustav Geley and Charles Richet into believing he had genuine psychic powers. In 1924, he was exposed by Harry Houdini as a fraud. Argamasilla peeked through his simple blindfold and lifted the edge of the box, so he could look inside it without others noticing.\nScience writer Martin Gardner has written that the ignorance of blindfold deception methods has been widespread in investigations into objects at remote locations from persons who claim to possess second sight. Gardner documented various conjuring techniques psychics such as Rosa Kuleshova, Lina Anderson and Nina Kulagina have used to peek from their blindfolds to deceive investigators into believing they used second sight."}
{"id": "10517", "revid": "48803326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10517", "title": "Economies of scale", "text": "In microeconomics, economies of scale are the cost advantages that enterprises obtain due to their scale of operation, and are typically measured by the amount of output produced per unit of cost (production cost). A decrease in cost per unit of output enables an increase in scale that is, increased production with lowered cost. At the basis of economies of scale, there may be technical, statistical, organizational or related factors to the degree of market control.\nEconomies of scale arise in a variety of organizational and business situations and at various levels, such as a production, plant or an entire enterprise. When average costs start falling as output increases, then economies of scale occur. Some economies of scale, such as capital cost of manufacturing facilities and friction loss of transportation and industrial equipment, have a physical or engineering basis. The economic concept dates back to Adam Smith and the idea of obtaining larger production returns through the use of division of labor. Diseconomies of scale are the opposite.\nEconomies of scale often have limits, such as passing the optimum design point where costs per additional unit begin to increase. Common limits include exceeding the nearby raw material supply, such as wood in the lumber, pulp and paper industry. A common limit for a low cost per unit weight raw materials is saturating the regional market, thus having to ship products uneconomic distances. Other limits include using energy less efficiently or having a higher defect rate.\nLarge producers are usually efficient at long runs of a product grade (a commodity) and find it costly to switch grades frequently. They will, therefore, avoid specialty grades even though they have higher margins. Often smaller (usually older) manufacturing facilities remain viable by changing from commodity-grade production to specialty products. Economies of scale must be distinguished from economies stemming from an increase in the production of a given plant. When a plant is used below its optimal production capacity, increases in its degree of utilization bring about decreases in the total average cost of production. Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen (1966) and Nicholas Kaldor (1972) both argue that these economies should not be treated as economies of scale.\nOverview.\nThe simple meaning of economies of scale is doing things more efficiently with increasing size. Common sources of economies of scale are purchasing (bulk buying of materials through long-term contracts), managerial (increasing the specialization of managers), financial (obtaining lower-interest charges when borrowing from banks and having access to a greater range of financial instruments), marketing (spreading the cost of advertising over a greater range of output in media markets), and technological (taking advantage of returns to scale in the production function). Each of these factors reduces the long run average costs (LRAC) of production by shifting the short-run average total cost (SRATC) curve down and to the right.\nEconomies of scale is a concept that may explain patterns in international trade or in the number of firms in a given market. The exploitation of economies of scale helps explain why companies grow large in some industries. It is also a justification for free trade policies, since some economies of scale may require a larger market than is possible within a particular country\u2014for example, it would not be efficient for Liechtenstein to have its own carmaker if they only sold to their local market. A lone carmaker may be profitable, but even more so if they exported cars to global markets in addition to selling to the local market. Economies of scale also play a role in a \"natural monopoly\". There is a distinction between two types of economies of scale: internal and external. An industry that exhibits an internal economy of scale is one where the costs of production fall when the number of firms in the industry drops, but the remaining firms increase their production to match previous levels. Conversely, an industry exhibits an external economy of scale when costs drop due to the introduction of more firms, thus allowing for more efficient use of specialized services and machinery.\nEconomies of scale exist whenever the total cost of producing two quantities of a product X is lower when a single firm instead of two separate firms produce it. See Economies of scope#Economics.\nDeterminants of economies of scale.\nPhysical and engineering basis: economies of increased dimension.\nSome of the economies of scale recognized in engineering have a physical basis, such as the square\u2013cube law, by which the surface of a vessel increases by the square of the dimensions while the volume increases by the cube. This law has a direct effect on the capital cost of such things as buildings, factories, pipelines, ships and airplanes.\nIn structural engineering, the strength of beams increases with the cube of the thickness.\nDrag loss of vehicles like aircraft or ships generally increases less than proportional with increasing cargo volume, although the physical details can be quite complicated. Therefore, making them larger usually results in less fuel consumption per ton of cargo at a given speed.\nHeat loss from industrial processes vary per unit of volume for pipes, tanks and other vessels in a relationship somewhat similar to the square\u2013cube law. In some productions, an increase in the size of the plant reduces the average variable cost, thanks to the energy savings resulting from the lower dispersion of heat.\nEconomies of increased dimension are often misinterpreted because of the confusion between indivisibility and three-dimensionality of space. This confusion arises from the fact that three-dimensional production elements, such as pipes and ovens, once installed and operating, are always technically indivisible. However, the economies of scale due to the increase in size do not depend on indivisibility but exclusively on the three-dimensionality of space. Indeed, indivisibility only entails the existence of economies of scale produced by the balancing of productive capacities, considered above; or of increasing returns in the utilisation of a single plant, due to its more efficient use as the quantity produced increases. However, this latter phenomenon has nothing to do with the economies of scale which, by definition, are linked to the use of a larger plant.\nEconomies in holding stocks and reserves.\nAt the base of economies of scale there are also returns to scale linked to statistical factors. In fact, the greater of the number of resources involved, the smaller, in proportion, is the quantity of reserves necessary to cope with unforeseen contingencies (for instance, machine spare parts, inventories, circulating capital, etc.).\nTransaction economies.\nOne of the reasons firms appear is to reduce transaction costs. A larger scale generally determines greater bargaining power over input prices and therefore benefits from pecuniary economies in terms of purchasing raw materials and intermediate goods compared to companies that make orders for smaller amounts. In this case, we speak of pecuniary economies, to highlight the fact that nothing changes from the \"physical\" point of view of the returns to scale. Furthermore, supply contracts entail fixed costs which lead to decreasing average costs if the scale of production increases. This is of important utility in the study of corporate finance.\nEconomies deriving from the balancing of production capacity.\nEconomies of productive capacity balancing derives from the possibility that a larger scale of production involves a more efficient use of the production capacities of the individual phases of the production process. If the inputs are indivisible and complementary, a small scale may be subject to idle times or to the underutilization of the productive capacity of some sub-processes. A higher production scale can make the different production capacities compatible. The reduction in machinery idle times is crucial in the case of a high cost of machinery.\nEconomies resulting from the division of labour and the use of superior techniques.\nA larger scale allows for a more efficient division of labour. The economies of division of labour derive from the increase in production speed, from the possibility of using specialized personnel and adopting more efficient techniques. An increase in the division of labour inevitably leads to changes in the quality of inputs and outputs.\nManagerial economics.\nMany administrative and organizational activities are mostly cognitive and, therefore, largely independent of the scale of production. When the size of the company and the division of labour increase, there are a number of advantages due to the possibility of making organizational management more effective and perfecting accounting and control techniques. Furthermore, the procedures and routines that turned out to be the best can be reproduced by managers at different times and places.\nLearning and growth economies.\nLearning and growth economies are at the base of dynamic economies of scale, associated with the process of growth of the scale dimension and not to the dimension of scale per se. Learning by doing implies improvements in the ability to perform and promotes the introduction of incremental innovations with a progressive lowering of average costs. Learning economies are directly proportional to the cumulative production (experience curve).\nGrowth economies emerge if a company gains an added benefit by expanding its size. These economies are due to the presence of some resource or competence that is not fully utilized, or to the existence of specific market positions that create a differential advantage in expanding the size of the firms. That growth economies disappear once the scale size expansion process is completed. For example, a company that owns a supermarket chain benefits from an economy of growth if, opening a new supermarket, it gets an increase in the price of the land it owns around the new supermarket. The sale of these lands to economic operators, who wish to open shops near the supermarket, allows the company in question to make a profit, making a profit on the revaluation of the value of building land.\nCapital and operating cost.\nOverall costs of capital projects are known to be subject to economies of scale. A crude estimate is that if the capital cost for a given sized piece of equipment is known, changing the size will change the capital cost by the 0.6 power of the capacity ratio (the point six to the power rule).\nIn estimating capital cost, it typically requires an insignificant amount of labor, and possibly not much more in materials, to install a larger capacity electrical wire or pipe having significantly greater capacity.\nThe cost of a unit of capacity of many types of equipment, such as electric motors, centrifugal pumps, diesel and gasoline engines, decreases as size increases. Also, the efficiency increases with size.\nCrew size and other operating costs for ships, trains and airplanes.\nOperating crew size for ships, airplanes, trains, etc., does not increase in direct proportion to capacity. (Operating crew consists of pilots, co-pilots, navigators, etc. and does not include passenger service personnel.) Many aircraft models were significantly lengthened or \"stretched\" to increase payload.\nMany manufacturing facilities, especially those making bulk materials like chemicals, refined petroleum products, cement and paper, have labor requirements that are not greatly influenced by changes in plant capacity. This is because labor requirements of automated processes tend to be based on the complexity of the operation rather than production rate, and many manufacturing facilities have nearly the same basic number of processing steps and pieces of equipment, regardless of production capacity.\nEconomical use of byproducts.\nKarl Marx noted that large scale manufacturing allowed economical use of products that would otherwise be waste. Marx cited the chemical industry as an example, which today along with petrochemicals, remains highly dependent on turning various residual reactant streams into salable products. In the pulp and paper industry, it is economical to burn bark and fine wood particles to produce process steam and to recover the spent pulping chemicals for conversion back to a usable form.\nEconomies of scale and the size of exporter.\nLarge and more productive firms typically generate enough net revenues abroad to cover the fixed costs associated with exporting. However, in the event of trade liberalization, resources will have to be reallocated toward the more productive firm, which raises the average productivity within the industry. \nFirms differ in their labor productivity and the quality of their products, so more efficient firms are more likely to generate more net income abroad and thus become exporters of their goods or services. There is a correlating relationship between a firm's total sales and underlying efficiency. Firms with higher productivity will always outperform a firm with lower productivity which will lead to lower sales. Through trade liberalization, organizations are able to drop their trade costs due to export growth. However, trade liberalization does not account for any tariff reduction or shipping logistics improvement. However, total economies of scale is based on the exporters individual frequency and size. So large-scale companies are more likely to have a lower cost per unit as opposed to small-scale companies. Likewise, high trade frequency companies are able to reduce their overall cost attributed per unit when compared to those of low-trade frequency companies.\nEconomies of scale and returns to scale.\nEconomies of scale is related to and can easily be confused with the theoretical economic notion of returns to scale. Where economies of scale refer to a firm's costs, returns to scale describe the relationship between inputs and outputs in a long-run (all inputs variable) production function. A production function has \"constant\" returns to scale if increasing all inputs by some proportion results in output increasing by that same proportion. Returns are \"decreasing\" if, say, doubling inputs results in less than double the output, and \"increasing\" if more than double the output. If a mathematical function is used to represent the production function, and if that production function is homogeneous, returns to scale are represented by the degree of homogeneity of the function. Homogeneous production functions with constant returns to scale are first degree homogeneous, increasing returns to scale are represented by degrees of homogeneity greater than one, and decreasing returns to scale by degrees of homogeneity less than one.\nIf the firm is a perfect competitor in all input markets, and thus the per-unit prices of all its inputs are unaffected by how much of the inputs the firm purchases, then it can be shown that at a particular level of output, the firm has economies of scale if and only if it has increasing returns to scale, has diseconomies of scale if and only if it has decreasing returns to scale, and has neither economies nor diseconomies of scale if it has constant returns to scale. In this case, with perfect competition in the output market the long-run equilibrium will involve all firms operating at the minimum point of their long-run average cost curves (i.e., at the borderline between economies and diseconomies of scale).\nIf, however, the firm is not a perfect competitor in the input markets, then the above conclusions are modified. For example, if there are increasing returns to scale in some range of output levels, but the firm is so big in one or more input markets that increasing its purchases of an input drives up the input's per-unit cost, then the firm could have diseconomies of scale in that range of output levels. Conversely, if the firm is able to get bulk discounts of an input, then it could have economies of scale in some range of output levels even if it has decreasing returns in production in that output range.\nIn essence, returns to scale refer to the variation in the relationship between inputs and output. This relationship is therefore expressed in \"physical\" terms. But when talking about economies of scale, the relation taken into consideration is that between the average production cost and the dimension of scale. Economies of scale therefore are affected by variations in input prices. If input prices remain the same as their quantities purchased by the firm increase, the notions of increasing returns to scale and economies of scale can be considered equivalent. However, if input prices vary in relation to their quantities purchased by the company, it is necessary to distinguish between returns to scale and economies of scale. The concept of economies of scale is more general than that of returns to scale since it includes the possibility of changes in the price of inputs when the quantity purchased of inputs varies with changes in the scale of production.\nThe literature assumed that due to the competitive nature of reverse auctions, and in order to compensate for lower prices and lower margins, suppliers seek higher volumes to maintain or increase the total revenue. Buyers, in turn, benefit from the lower transaction costs and economies of scale that result from larger volumes. In part as a result, numerous studies have indicated that the procurement volume must be sufficiently high to provide sufficient profits to attract enough suppliers, and provide buyers with enough savings to cover their additional costs.\nHowever, Shalev and Asbjornse found, in their research based on 139 reverse auctions conducted in the public sector by public sector buyers, that the higher auction volume, or economies of scale, did not lead to better success of the auction. They found that auction volume did not correlate with competition, nor with the number of bidders, suggesting that auction volume does not promote additional competition. They noted, however, that their data included a wide range of products, and the degree of competition in each market varied significantly, and offer that further research on this issue should be conducted to determine whether these findings remain the same when purchasing the same product for both small and high volumes. Keeping competitive factors constant, increasing auction volume may further increase competition.\nEconomies of scale in the history of economic analysis.\nEconomies of scale in classical economists.\nThe first systematic analysis of the advantages of the division of labour capable of generating economies of scale, both in a static and dynamic sense, was that contained in the famous First Book of Wealth of Nations (1776) by Adam Smith, generally considered the founder of political economy as an autonomous discipline.\nJohn Stuart Mill, in Chapter IX of the First Book of his Principles, referring to the work of Charles Babbage (On the economics of machines and manufactories), widely analyses the relationships between increasing returns and scale of production all inside the production unit.\nEconomies of scale in Marx and distributional consequences.\nIn (1867), Karl Marx, referring to Charles Babbage, extensively analyzed economies of scale and concludes that they are one of the factors underlying the ever-increasing concentration of capital. Marx observes that in the capitalist system the technical conditions of the work process are continuously revolutionized in order to increase the surplus by improving the productive force of work. According to Marx, with the cooperation of many workers brings about an economy in the use of the means of production and an increase in productivity due to the increase in the division of labour. Furthermore, the increase in the size of the machinery allows significant savings in construction, installation and operation costs. The tendency to exploit economies of scale entails a continuous increase in the volume of production which, in turn, requires a constant expansion of the size of the market. However, if the market does not expand at the same rate as production increases, overproduction crises can occur. According to Marx the capitalist system is therefore characterized by two tendencies, connected to economies of scale: towards a growing concentration and towards economic crises due to overproduction.\nIn his 1844 \"Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts\", Karl Marx observes that economies of scale have historically been associated with an increasing concentration of private wealth and have been used to justify such concentration. Marx points out that concentrated private ownership of large-scale economic enterprises is a historically contingent fact, and not essential to the nature of such enterprises. In the case of agriculture, for example, Marx calls attention to the sophistical nature of the arguments used to justify the system of concentrated ownership of land:\nInstead of concentrated private ownership of land, Marx recommends that economies of scale should instead be realized by associations:\nEconomies of scale in Marshall.\nAlfred Marshall notes that Antoine Augustin Cournot and others have considered \"the internal economies [...] apparently without noticing that their premises lead inevitably to the conclusion that, whatever firm first gets a good start will obtain a monopoly of the whole business of its trade \u2026 \". Marshall believes that there are factors that limit this trend toward monopoly, and in particular:\nSraffa's critique.\nPiero Sraffa observes that Marshall, in order to justify the operation of the law of increasing returns without it coming into conflict with the hypothesis of free competition, tended to highlight the advantages of external economies linked to an increase in the production of an entire sector of activity. However, \"those economies which are external from the point of view of the individual firm, but internal as regards the industry in its aggregate, constitute precisely the class which is most seldom to be met with.\" \"In any case - Sraffa notes \u2013 in so far as external economies of the kind in question exist, they are not linked to be called forth by small increases in production,\" as required by the marginalist theory of price. Sraffa points out that, in the equilibrium theory of the individual industries, the presence of external economies cannot play an important role because this theory is based on marginal changes in the quantities produced.\nSraffa concludes that, if the hypothesis of perfect competition is maintained, economies of scale should be excluded. He then suggests the possibility of abandoning the assumption of free competition to address the study of firms that have their own particular market. This stimulated a whole series of studies on the cases of imperfect competition in Cambridge. However, in the succeeding years Sraffa followed a different path of research that brought him to write and publish his main work \"Production of commodities by means of commodities\" . In this book, Sraffa determines relative prices assuming no changes in output, so that no question arises as to the variation or constancy of returns.\nRule of six-tenths.\nIn 1947, DuPont engineer Roger Williams, Jr. (1930-2005) published a rule of thumb that costs of chemical process are roughly proportional to the tonnage in power ~0.6. In the following decades it became widely adopted other engineering industries and terrestrial mining, sometimes (e. g., in electrical power generation) with modified exponential scaling factors.\nEconomies of scale and the tendency towards monopoly: \"Cournot's dilemma\".\nIt has been noted that in many industrial sectors there are numerous companies with different sizes and organizational structures, despite the presence of significant economies of scale. This contradiction, between the empirical evidence and the logical incompatibility between economies of scale and competition, has been called the 'Cournot dilemma'. As Mario Morroni observes, Cournot's dilemma appears to be unsolvable if we only consider the effects of economies of scale on the dimension of scale. If, on the other hand, the analysis is expanded, including the aspects concerning the development of knowledge and the organization of transactions, it is possible to conclude that economies of scale do not always lead to monopoly. In fact, the competitive advantages deriving from the development of the firm's capabilities and from the management of transactions with suppliers and customers can counterbalance those provided by the scale, thus counteracting the tendency towards a monopoly inherent in economies of scale. In other words, the heterogeneity of the organizational forms and of the size of the companies operating in a sector of activity can be determined by factors regarding the quality of the products, the production flexibility, the contractual methods, the learning opportunities, the heterogeneity of preferences of customers who express a differentiated demand with respect to the quality of the product, and assistance before and after the sale. Very different organizational forms can therefore co-exist in the same sector of activity, even in the presence of economies of scale, such as, for example, flexible production on a large scale, small-scale flexible production, mass production, industrial production based on rigid technologies associated with flexible organizational systems and traditional artisan production. The considerations regarding economies of scale are therefore important, but not sufficient to explain the size of the company and the market structure. It is also necessary to take into account the factors linked to the development of capabilities and the management of transaction costs.\nExternal economies of scale.\nExternal economies of scale tend to be more prevalent than internal economies of scale. Through the external economies of scale, the entry of new firms benefits all existing competitors as it creates greater competition and also reduces the average cost for all firms as opposed to internal economies of scale which only allows benefits to the individual firm. Advantages that arise from external economies of scale include; \nSources.\nPurchasing.\nFirms are able to lower their average costs by buying their inputs required for the production process in bulk or from special wholesalers. \nManagerial.\nFirms might be able to lower their average costs by improving their management structure within the firm. This can range from hiring better skilled or more experienced managers from the industry.\nTechnological.\nTechnological advancements change production processes and subsequently reduce the overall cost per unit. Tim Hindle argues that the rollout of the internet \"has completely reshaped the assumptions underlying economies of scale\"."}

He authored 57 books, written mostly in French and English, including \"Night\", a work based on his experiences as a Jewish prisoner in the Auschwitz and Buchenwald concentration camps.\nIn his political activities Wiesel became a regular speaker on the subject of the Holocaust and remained a strong defender of human rights during his lifetime. He also advocated for victims of oppression including Soviet and Ethiopian Jews, the apartheid in South Africa, the Bosnian genocide, Sudan, the Kurds and the Armenian genocide, Argentina's Desaparecidos or Nicaragua's Miskito people. He was a strong supporter of the state of Israel and was personally close to Benjamin Netanyahu.\nHe was a professor of the humanities at Boston University, which created the Elie Wiesel Center for Jewish Studies in his honor. He helped establish the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.\nWiesel received awards including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986. He was a founding board member of the New York Human Rights Foundation and remained active in it throughout his life.\nEarly life.\nEliezer Wiesel was born in Sighet (now Sighetu Marma\u021biei), Maramure\u0219, in the Carpathian Mountains of Romania. His parents were Sarah Feig and Shlomo Wiesel. At home, Wiesel's family spoke Yiddish most of the time, but also German, Hungarian, and Romanian. Wiesel's mother, Sarah, was the daughter of Dodye Feig, a Vizhnitz Hasid and farmer from the nearby village of Bocsk\u00f3. Dodye was active and trusted within the community.\nWiesel's father, Shlomo, instilled a strong sense of humanism in his son, encouraging him to learn Hebrew and to read literature, whereas his mother encouraged him to study the Torah. Wiesel said his father represented reason, while his mother Sarah promoted faith. Wiesel was instructed that his genealogy traced back to Rabbi Schlomo Yitzhaki (Rashi), and was a descendant of Rabbi Yeshayahu ben Abraham Horovitz ha-Levi.\nWiesel had three siblings\u2014older sisters Beatrice and Hilda, and younger sister Tzipora. Beatrice and Hilda survived the war, and were reunited with Wiesel at a French orphanage. They eventually emigrated to North America, with Beatrice moving to Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Tzipora, Shlomo, and Sarah did not survive the Holocaust.\nImprisonment and orphaning during the Holocaust.\nIn March 1944, Germany occupied Hungary, thus extending the Holocaust into Northern Transylvania as well. Wiesel was 15, and he, with his family, along with the rest of the town's Jewish population, was placed in one of the two confinement ghettos set up in M\u00e1ramarossziget (Sighet), the town where he had been born and raised. In May 1944, the Hungarian authorities, under German pressure, began to deport the Jewish community to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where up to 90 percent of the people were murdered on arrival.\nImmediately after they were sent to Auschwitz, his mother and his younger sister were murdered in the gas chambers. Wiesel and his father were selected to perform labor so long as they remained able-bodied, after which they were to be murdered in the gas chambers. Wiesel and his father were later deported to the concentration camp at Buchenwald. Until that transfer, he admitted to Oprah Winfrey, his primary motivation for trying to survive Auschwitz was knowing that his father was still alive: \"I knew that if I died, he would die.\" After they were taken to Buchenwald, his father died before the camp was liberated. In \"Night\", Wiesel recalled the shame he felt when he heard his father being beaten and was unable to help.\nWiesel was tattooed with inmate number \"A-7713\" on his left arm. The camp was liberated by the U.S. Third Army on April 11, 1945, when they were just prepared to be evacuated from Buchenwald.\nMarch of the Living.\nThe March of the Living is an annual educational program that has brought over 300,000 participants from around the world to Poland, where they visit historical sites of the Holocaust, make a two-mile trek from Auschwitz to the former extermination site of Birkenau. Students learn about the experience through live testimony from survivors. Wiesel participated in the first March of the Living in 1988, during its founding year. Wiesel also attended in 1990, and in 2005, during the 60th anniversary of the end of WWII. Wiesel addressed over 18,000 in attendance. It was the biggest event in the program's history .\nOn the 1990 March of the Living, Elie Wiesel addressed the participants at Auschwitz about his concerns about antisemitism. He stated, \"We were convinced that antisemitism perished here. Antisemitism did not perish here, it's victims perished here.\" He started to share a story of a young girl, paused, and left the stage. The footage stated Wiesel was simply unable to continue the story. The corroborating article from Eli Rubenstein, who was in attendance that day described that even \"the world's most eloquent witness to the Holocaust,\" was not able to convey the story that led to the fate of this young girl. \nin 2017, Wiesel's son, Elisha participated in the March of the Living in memory of his father, honoring his legacy. Since his father's passing, he has spoken at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum and Auschwitz, and has began working on his late father's foundation, the Elie Wiesel Foundation.\nWiesel is included in the publication \".\" Along with his picture from when he was imprisoned at Buchenwald, he was quoted from the 1990 March of the Living: \nPost-war career as a writer.\nFrance.\nAfter World War II ended and Wiesel was freed, he joined a transport of 1,000 child survivors of Buchenwald to Ecouis, France, where the \u0152uvre de secours aux enfants (OSE) had established a rehabilitation center. Wiesel joined a smaller group of 90 to 100 boys from Orthodox homes who wanted kosher facilities and a higher level of religious observance; they were cared for in a home in Ambloy under the directorship of Judith Hemmendinger. This home was later moved to Taverny and operated until 1947.\nAfterwards, Wiesel traveled to Paris where he learned French and studied literature, philosophy and psychology at the Sorbonne. He heard lectures by philosopher Martin Buber and existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre and he spent his evenings reading works by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Franz Kafka, and Thomas Mann.\nBy the time he was 19, he had begun working as a journalist, writing in French, while also teaching Hebrew and working as a choirmaster. He wrote for Israeli and French newspapers, including \"Tsien in Kamf\" (in Yiddish).\nIn 1946, after learning of the Irgun's bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, Wiesel made an unsuccessful attempt to join the underground Zionist movement. In 1948, he translated articles from Hebrew into Yiddish for Irgun periodicals, but never became a member of the organization. In 1949, he traveled to Israel as a correspondent for the French newspaper \"L'arche\". He then was hired as Paris correspondent for the Israeli newspaper \"Yedioth Ahronoth\", subsequently becoming its roaming international correspondent.\nFor ten years after the war, Wiesel refused to write about or discuss his experiences during the Holocaust. He began to reconsider his decision after a meeting with the French author Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac, the 1952 Nobel Laureate in Literature who eventually became Wiesel's close friend. Mauriac was a devout Christian who had fought in the French Resistance during the war. He compared Wiesel to \"Lazarus rising from the dead\", and saw from Wiesel's tormented eyes, \"the death of God in the soul of a child\". Mauriac persuaded him to begin writing about his harrowing experiences.\nWiesel first wrote the 900-page memoir \"Un di velt hot geshvign\" (\"And the World Remained Silent\") in Yiddish, which was published in abridged form in Buenos Aires. Wiesel rewrote a shortened version of the manuscript in French, \"La Nuit\", in 1955. It was translated into English as \"Night\" in 1960. The book sold few copies after its initial publication, but still attracted interest from reviewers, leading to television interviews with Wiesel and meetings with writers such as Saul Bellow.\nAs its profile rose, \"Night\" was eventually translated into 30 languages with ten million copies sold in the United States. At one point film director Orson Welles wanted to make it into a feature film, but Wiesel refused, feeling that his memoir would lose its meaning if it were told without the silences in between his words. Oprah Winfrey made it a spotlight selection for her book club in 2006.\nUnited States.\nIn 1955, Wiesel moved to New York as foreign correspondent for the Israel daily, \"Yediot Ahronot\". In 1969, he married Austrian Marion Erster Rose, who also translated many of his books. They had one son, Shlomo Elisha Wiesel, named after Wiesel's father.\nIn the U.S., he eventually wrote over 40 books, most of them non-fiction Holocaust literature, and novels. As an author, he was awarded a number of literary prizes and is considered among the most important in describing the Holocaust from a highly personal perspective. As a result, some historians credited Wiesel with giving the term \"Holocaust\" its present meaning, although he did not feel that the word adequately described that historical event. In 1975, he co-founded the magazine \"Moment\" with writer Leonard Fein.\nThe 1979 book and play \"The Trial of God\" are said to have been based on his real-life Auschwitz experience of witnessing three Jews who, close to death, conduct a trial against God, under the accusation that He has been oppressive towards the Jewish people.\nWiesel also played a role in the initial success of \"The Painted Bird\" by Jerzy Kosinski by endorsing it before it became known the book was fiction and, in the sense that it was presented as all Kosinski's true experience, a hoax.\nWiesel published two volumes of memoirs. The first, \"All Rivers Run to the Sea\", was published in 1994 and covered his life up to the year 1969. The second, titled \"And the Sea is Never Full\" and published in 1999, covered the years from 1969 to 1999.\nPolitical activism.\nWiesel and his wife, Marion, started the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity in 1986. He served as chairman of the President's Commission on the Holocaust (later renamed the US Holocaust Memorial Council) from 1978 to 1986, spearheading the building of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. Sigmund Strochlitz was his close friend and confidant during these years.\nThe Holocaust Memorial Museum gives the Elie Wiesel Award to \"internationally prominent individuals whose actions have advanced the Museum's vision of a world where people confront hatred, prevent genocide, and promote human dignity\". The Foundation had invested its endowment in money manager Bernard L. Madoff's investment Ponzi scheme, costing the Foundation $15\u00a0million and Wiesel and his wife much of their own personal savings.\nSupport for Israeli government policy.\nIn 1982, at the request of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, Wiesel agreed to resign from his position as chairman of a planned international conference on the Holocaust and the Armenian genocide. Wiesel then worked with the Foreign Ministry in its attempts to get the conference either canceled or to remove all discussion of the Armenian genocide from it, and to those ends he provided the Foreign Ministry with internal documents on the conference's planning and lobbied fellow academics to not attend the conference.\nDuring his lifetime, Wiesel had deflected questions on the topic of the Israeli settlements, claiming to abstain from commenting on Israel's internal debates. According to Hussein Ibish, despite this position, Wiesel had gone on record as supporting the idea of expanding Jewish settlements into the Palestinian territories conquered by Israel during the 6 Day War; such settlements are considered illegal by the international community.\nAwards and other activism.\nWiesel was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986 for speaking out against violence, repression, and racism. The Norwegian Nobel Committee described Wiesel as \"one of the most important spiritual leaders and guides in an age when violence, repression, and racism continue to characterize the world\" and called him a \"messenger to mankind\". It also stressed that Wiesel's commitment originated in the sufferings of the Jewish people but that he expanded it to embrace all repressed peoples and races.\nIn his acceptance speech he delivered a message \"of peace, atonement, and human dignity\". He explained his feelings: \"Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere. When human lives are endangered, when human dignity is in jeopardy, national borders and sensitivities become irrelevant.\"\nHe received many other prizes and honors for his work, including the Congressional Gold Medal in 1985, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and The International Center in New York's Award of Excellence. \nHe was also elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1996.\nWiesel co-founded \"Moment\" magazine with Leonard Fein in 1975. They founded the magazine to provide a voice for American Jews. He was also a member of the International Advisory Board of NGO Monitor.\nA staunch opponent of the death penalty, Wiesel stated that he thought that even Adolf Eichmann should not have been executed.\nIn April 1999, Wiesel delivered the speech \"The Perils of Indifference\" in Washington D.C., criticizing the people and countries who chose to be indifferent while the Holocaust was happening. He defined indifference as being neutral between two sides, which, in this case, amounts to overlooking the victims of the Holocaust. Throughout the speech, he expressed the view that a little bit of attention, either positive or negative, is better than no attention at all.\nIn 2003, he discovered and publicized the fact that at least 280,000 Romanian and Ukrainian Jews, along with other groups, were massacred in Romanian-run death camps.\nIn 2005, he gave a speech at the opening ceremony of the new building of Yad Vashem, the Israeli Holocaust History Museum:\nI know what people say \u2013 it is so easy. Those that were there won't agree with that statement. The statement is: it was man's inhumanity to man. NO! It was man's inhumanity to Jews! Jews were not killed because they were human beings. In the eyes of the killers they were not human beings! They were Jews!\nIn early 2006, Wiesel accompanied Oprah Winfrey as she visited Auschwitz, a visit which was broadcast as part of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\". The trip was organized by International March of the Living's Vice Chair, \"David Machlis.\" On November 30, 2006, Wiesel received a knighthood in London in recognition of his work toward raising Holocaust education in the United Kingdom.\nIn September 2006, he appeared before the UN Security Council with actor George Clooney to call attention to the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. When Wiesel died, Clooney wrote, \"We had a champion who carried our pain, our guilt, and our responsibility on his shoulders for generations.\"\nIn 2007, Wiesel was awarded the Dayton Literary Peace Prize's Lifetime Achievement Award. That same year, the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity issued a letter condemning Armenian genocide denial, a letter that was signed by 53 Nobel laureates including Wiesel. Wiesel repeatedly called Turkey's 90-year-old campaign to downplay its actions during the Armenian genocide a double killing.\nIn 2009, Wiesel criticized the Vatican for lifting the excommunication of controversial bishop Richard Williamson, a member of the Society of Saint Pius X. The excommunication was later reimposed.\nIn June 2009, Wiesel accompanied US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel as they toured the Buchenwald concentration camp. Wiesel was an adviser at the Gatestone Institute. In 2010, Wiesel accepted a five-year appointment as a Distinguished Presidential Fellow at Chapman University in Orange County, California. In that role, he made a one-week visit to Chapman annually to meet with students and offer his perspective on subjects ranging from Holocaust history to religion, languages, literature, law and music.\nIn July 2009, Wiesel announced his support to the minority Tamils in Sri Lanka. He said that, \"Wherever minorities are being persecuted, we must raise our voices to protest\u00a0... The Tamil people are being disenfranchised and victimized by the\u00a0Sri Lanka authorities. This injustice must stop. The Tamil people must be allowed to live in peace and flourish in their homeland.\"\nIn 2009, Wiesel returned to Hungary for his first visit since the Holocaust. During this visit, Wiesel participated in a conference at the Upper House Chamber of the Hungarian Parliament, met Prime Minister Gordon Bajnai and President L\u00e1szl\u00f3 S\u00f3lyom, and made a speech to the approximately 10,000 participants of an anti-racist gathering held in Faith Hall. However, in 2012, he protested against \"the whitewashing\" of Hungary's involvement in the Holocaust, and he gave up the Great Cross award he had received from the Hungarian government.\nWiesel was active in trying to prevent Iran from making nuclear weapons, stating that, \"The words and actions of the leadership of Iran leave no doubt as to their intentions\". He also condemned Hamas for the \"use of children as human shields\" during the 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict by running an ad in several large newspapers. \"The Times\" refused to run the advertisement, saying, \"The opinion being expressed is too strong, and too forcefully made, and will cause concern amongst a significant number of \"Times\" readers.\"\nWiesel often emphasized the Jewish connection to Jerusalem, and criticized the Obama administration for pressuring Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to halt East Jerusalem Israeli settlement construction. He stated that \"Jerusalem is above politics. It is mentioned more than six hundred times in Scripture\u2014and not a single time in the Koran\u00a0... It belongs to the Jewish people and is much more than a city\".\nTeaching.\nWiesel held the position of Andrew Mellon Professor of the Humanities at Boston University from 1976, teaching in both its religion and philosophy departments. He became a close friend of the president and chancellor John Silber. The university created the Elie Wiesel Center for Jewish Studies in his honor. From 1972 to 1976 Wiesel was a Distinguished Professor at the City University of New York and member of the American Federation of Teachers.\nIn 1982 he served as the first Henry Luce Visiting Scholar in Humanities and Social Thought at Yale University. He also co-instructed Winter Term (January) courses at Eckerd College, St. Petersburg, Florida. From 1997 to 1999 he was Ingeborg Rennert Visiting professor of Judaic Studies at Barnard College of Columbia University.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1969 he married Marion Erster Rose, who originally was from Austria and also translated many of his books. They had one son, Shlomo Elisha Wiesel, named after Wiesel's father. The family lived in Greenwich, Connecticut.\nWiesel was attacked in a San Francisco hotel by 22-year-old Holocaust denier Eric Hunt in February 2007, but was not injured. Hunt was arrested the following month and charged with multiple offenses.\nIn May 2011, Wiesel served as the Washington University in St. Louis commencement speaker.\nIn February 2012, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints performed a posthumous baptism for Simon Wiesenthal's parents without proper authorization. After his own name was submitted for proxy baptism, Wiesel spoke out against the unauthorized practice of posthumously baptizing Jews and asked presidential candidate and Latter-day Saint Mitt Romney to denounce it. Romney's campaign declined to comment, directing such questions to church officials.\nDeath and aftermath.\nWiesel died on the morning of July 2, 2016, at his home in Manhattan, aged 87. After a private funeral service was conducted in honor of him at the Fifth Avenue Synagogue, he was buried at the Sharon Gardens Cemetery in Valhalla, New York, on July 3.\nUtah senator Orrin Hatch paid tribute to Wiesel in a speech on the Senate floor the following week, in which he said that \"With Elie's passing, we have lost a beacon of humanity and hope. We have lost a hero of human rights and a luminary of Holocaust literature.\"\nIn 2018, antisemitic graffiti was found on the house where Wiesel was born.\nAwards and honors.\nHonorary degrees.\nWiesel had received more than 90 honorary degrees from colleges worldwide.\nReferences.\nInformational notes\nCitations\nSpeeches and interviews"}
{"id": "10520", "revid": "47179197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10520", "title": "Ed Wood", "text": "Edward Davis Wood Jr. (October 10, 1924\u00a0\u2013 December 10, 1978) was an American filmmaker, actor, and pulp novelist.\nIn the 1950s, Wood directed several low-budget science fiction, crime and horror films that later became cult classics, notably \"Glen or Glenda\" (1953), \"Jail Bait\" (1954), \"Bride of the Monster\" (1955), \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" (1957) and \"Night of the Ghouls\" (1959). In the 1960s and 1970s, he moved towards sexploitation and pornographic films such as \"The Sinister Urge\" (1960), \"Orgy of the Dead\" (1965) and \"Necromania\" (1971), and wrote over 80 lurid pulp crime and sex novels.\nNotable for their campy aesthetics, technical errors, unsophisticated special effects, use of poorly-matched stock footage, eccentric casts, idiosyncratic stories and non sequitur dialogue, Wood's films remained largely obscure until he was posthumously awarded a Golden Turkey Award for Worst Director of All Time in 1980, renewing public interest in his life and work.\nFollowing the publication of Rudolph Grey's 1992 oral biography \"Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood Jr.\", a biopic of his life, \"Ed Wood\" (1994), was directed by Tim Burton. Starring Johnny Depp as Wood and Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, the film received critical acclaim and various awards, including two Academy Awards.\nEarly years.\nWood's father worked for the United States Post Office as a custodian, and his family relocated numerous times around the United States. Eventually, they settled in Poughkeepsie, New York, where Wood was born in 1924. According to his second wife, Kathy O'Hara, Wood's mother Lillian would dress him in girl's clothing when he was a child because she had always wanted a daughter (Wood had one brother, several years younger than himself). For the rest of his life, Wood crossdressed, infatuated with the feel of angora on his skin.\nDuring his childhood, Wood was interested in the performing arts and pulp fiction. He collected comic books and pulp magazines, and adored movies, especially Westerns, serials, and the occult. Buck Jones and Bela Lugosi were two of his earliest childhood idols. He often skipped school in order to watch motion pictures at the local movie theater, where stills from last week's films would often be thrown into the trash by theater staff, allowing Wood to salvage the images, and to add to his extensive collection.\nOn his 12th birthday, in 1936, Wood received as a gift his first movie camera, a Kodak \"Cine Special\". One of his first pieces of footage showed the airship \"Hindenburg\" passing over the Hudson River at Poughkeepsie, shortly before its disastrous crash at Lakehurst, New Jersey. One of Wood's first paid jobs was as a cinema usher, and he also sang and played drums in a band. Subsequently, he formed a quartet called \"Eddie Wood's Little Splinters\" in which he sang and played multiple stringed instruments.\nMilitary service.\nIn 1942, Wood enlisted at age 17 in the United States Marine Corps, just months after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Assigned to the 2nd Defense Battalion, he reached the rank of corporal before he was discharged in 1946 at age 21. Although Wood reportedly claimed to have faced strenuous combat, including having his front teeth knocked out by a Japanese soldier, his military records reveal that to be false, apart from recovering bodies on Betio following the Battle of Tarawa, and experiencing minor Japanese bombing raids on Betio and the Ellice Islands. A recurring filariasis infection left him performing clerical work for the remainder of his enlistment. His dental extractions were carried out over several months by Navy dentists, unconnected to any combat. Wood had false teeth that he would slip out from his mouth when he wanted to make his wife Kathy laugh, showing her a big toothless grin. Wood later claimed that he feared being wounded in battle more than he feared being killed, mainly because he was afraid a combat medic would discover him wearing a pink bra and panties under his uniform during the Battle of Tarawa.\nCareer.\nDirecting and screenwriting.\nIn 1947, Wood moved to Hollywood, California, where he wrote scripts and directed television pilots, commercials and several forgotten micro-budget westerns, most of which failed to sell. Wood biographer Rudolph Grey states that Ed Wood made approximately 125 commercials for Story-Ad films and approximately 30 commercials for Play-Ad Films, in addition to a few commercials for \"Pie-Quick\".\nIn 1948, Wood wrote, produced, directed, and starred in \"The Casual Company\", a play derived from his own unpublished novel which was based on his service in the United States Marine Corps. It opened at the Village Playhouse to negative reviews on October 25. That same year, he wrote and directed a low-budget western called \"Crossroads of Laredo\" with the aid of a young producer he met named Crawford John Thomas. The film was shot silent and was not completed during Wood's lifetime.\nIn 1949, Wood and Thomas acted together in a play called \"The Blackguard Returns\" at the Gateway Theatre (Wood played the Sheriff and Thomas was the villain). Wood joined the Screen Actors Guild in 1951, and worked very briefly as a stuntman among other things. When writing, Wood used a number of different pen names, including Ann Gora (in reference to Angora, his favorite textile) and Akdov Telmig (the backwards spelling of his favorite drink, the vodka gimlet).\nIn 1952, Wood was introduced to actor Bela Lugosi by friend and fellow writer-producer Alex Gordon (Wood's roommate at the time who was later involved in creating American International Pictures). Lugosi's son, Bela George Lugosi Jr., has been among those who felt Wood exploited the senior Lugosi's stardom, taking advantage of the fading actor when he could not afford to refuse any work. However, most documents and interviews with other Wood associates in \"Nightmare of Ecstasy\" suggest that Wood and Lugosi were genuine friends and that Wood helped Lugosi through the worst days of his clinical depression and drug addiction. Lugosi had become dependent on morphine as a way of controlling his debilitating sciatica over the years, and was in a poor mental state caused by his recent divorce.\n\"Glen or Glenda\".\nIn 1953, Wood wrote and directed the semi-documentary film \"Glen or Glenda\" (originally titled \"I Changed My Sex!\") with producer George Weiss. The film starred Wood (under the alias \"Daniel Davis\") as a transvestite, his girlfriend Dolores Fuller, Timothy Farrell, Lyle Talbot, Conrad Brooks and Bela Lugosi as the narrator/scientist. Fuller was shocked when she learned soon afterward that Wood actually was a cross-dresser.\nIn 1953, Wood wrote and directed a stage show for Lugosi called \"The Bela Lugosi Review\" (a take-off on \"Dracula\") that was put on at the Silver Slipper in Las Vegas. When Lugosi appeared on the TV show \"You Asked For It\" that same year, he announced that Ed Wood was producing a \"Dr. Acula\" TV show for him, but it never materialized. Wood acted as Lugosi's dialogue coach when he guest-starred on \"The Red Skelton Show\" in 1954, alongside Lon Chaney Jr. and Vampira (aka Maila Nurmi).\n\"Jail Bait\".\nWood co-produced and directed a crime film, \"Jail Bait\" (1954, originally titled \"The Hidden Face\"), along with his co-writer/roommate Alex Gordon, which starred Herbert Rawlinson (as the plastic surgeon), Lyle Talbot, Dolores Fuller, Timothy Farrell, Theodora Thurman and Steve Reeves (in one of his first acting jobs). Bela Lugosi was supposed to play the lead role of the plastic surgeon, but was busy with another project when filming started and had to bow out. His replacement, Herbert Rawlinson, died the day after he filmed his scenes. Distributor Ron Ormond changed the title from \"The Hidden Face\" to \"Jail Bait\" just before releasing it.\n\"Bride of the Monster\".\nWood produced and directed the horror film \"Bride of the Monster\" (1955, originally titled \"Bride of the Atom\" or \"The Monster of the Marshes\"), based on an original story idea by Alex Gordon which he had originally called \"The Atomic Monster\". It starred Bela Lugosi as the mad scientist, Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson as mute manservant \"Lobo\", Paul Marco, Billy Benedict (\"Whitey\" of \"The Bowery Boys\"), Harvey B. Dunn and Loretta King. Soon after the film was completed, Bela Lugosi committed himself to the Norwalk State Hospital for three months, to be treated for drug addiction. The film premiered on May 11, 1955, at the Paramount theater in Hollywood while Lugosi was institutionalized, but a special screening was arranged for him upon his release, pleasing him greatly.\n\"The Violent Years\".\nIn 1956, Wood wrote the screenplay (uncredited) for the film \"The Violent Years\" (originally titled \"Teenage Girl Gang\"), which was directed by William M. Morgan, starring \"Playboy\" model Jean Moorhead, Timothy Farrell, and serial star I. Stanford Jolley (as a judge).\nWood began filming a juvenile delinquency film called \"Rock and Roll Hell\" (a.k.a. \"Hellborn\") in 1956, but producer George Weiss pulled the plug on the project after only ten minutes of footage had been completed. Wood's friend Conrad Brooks purchased the footage from Weiss, and some scenes were later incorporated as stock footage into Wood's later \"Night of the Ghouls\" (1959). (The entire ten minutes of footage was later released complete on VHS in 1993, as \"Hellborn\".)\n\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\".\nIn late 1956, Wood co-produced, wrote, and directed his science fiction opus \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" (his screenplay was originally titled \"Grave Robbers from Outer Space\"), which featured Bela Lugosi in a small role. (Although Lugosi died in August 1956 before production began, Wood used footage he had shot of Lugosi in 1955\u20131956.) The film also starred Tor Johnson, Vampira (Maila Nurmi), Tom Mason (who doubled for Lugosi in some scenes), and the Amazing Criswell as the film's narrator. \"Plan 9\" premiered on March 15, 1957, at the Carlton Theatre in Hollywood, and later went into general release in July 1958 (retitled \"Plan Nine from Outer Space\") in Texas and a number of other Southern states. It was finally sold to late night television in 1961, thereby finding its audience over the years. It became Wood's best-known film and found a cult following in 1980 when Michael Medved declared this film \"the worst film ever made\" in his book \"The Golden Turkey Awards\".\n\"Final Curtain\".\nIn 1957, Wood wrote and directed a pilot for a suspense-horror TV series called \"Portraits in Terror\" that ultimately failed to sell. The pilot, entitled \"Final Curtain\", sees an old and world-weary actor wandering in an empty theatre, imagining ghosts and a living mannequin haunting the backstage area, until he realizes that he himself is dead. The episode has no dialogue, and Dudley Manlove narrates the thoughts of Duke Moore as the actor. Lugosi would have starred in this short film had he lived. Parts of the unsold pilot were later recycled for use in Wood's \"Night of the Ghouls\" (1959). The episode was thought to be lost until a complete print was located . It was remastered and given its first ever cinema showing in a theater in February 2012. Today it is widely available online and on DVD.\n\"Night of the Ghouls\".\nIn 1958, Wood wrote, produced, and directed \"Night of the Ghouls\" (originally titled \"Revenge of the Dead\"), starring Kenne Duncan, Tor Johnson (reprising his role as \"Lobo\" from \"Bride of the Monster\"), Criswell, Duke Moore, and Valda Hansen. The film premiered at the Vista Theatre in Hollywood on a double bill with the Lana Turner movie \"Imitation of Life\" on March 17, 1959, and then promptly vanished from circulation. For many years, it was thought to be a lost film, but distribution of the film was held up for 25 years because Wood had not paid the lab bill. Video producer Wade Williams paid the bill and released the film on videocassette in 1984, copyrighting the film in his own name.\nIn 1958, Wood also wrote the screenplay for \"The Bride and the Beast\" (1958), which was directed by Adrian Weiss. Wood's screenplay was based on Weiss' plot.\nWood also wrote the screenplay (as \"Peter LaRoche\") for a 1959 \"nudie cutie\" film called \"Revenge of the Virgins\", which was directed by Peter Perry Jr.\n\"The Sinister Urge\".\nWood wrote and directed the exploitation film \"The Sinister Urge\" (1960), starring Kenne Duncan, Duke Moore, Dino Fantini, Harvey B. Dunn and Carl Anthony. Filmed in just five days, this is the last mainstream film Wood directed, although it has exploitation elements. The film contains an \"eerily prescient\" scene, in which Carl Anthony's character states, \"I look at this slush, and I try to remember, at one time, I made good movies\". The scenes of the teenagers at the pizzeria had been previously shot in 1956 for Wood's unfinished juvenile delinquency film, \"Rock and Roll Hell\" (a.k.a. \"Hellborn\").\nAlso in 1960, Wood wrote the screenplay for \"The Peeper\", which he intended as a direct sequel to his 1960 film \"The Sinister Urge\", but it was never produced.\nWood also contributed to the plot of Jane Mann's 1961 screenplay \"Anatomy of a Psycho\". The film was directed by Mann's husband Boris Petroff.\nIn 1963, Wood wrote the screenplay for \"Shotgun Wedding\" (an exploitation film directed by Boris Petroff about hillbillies marrying child brides in the Ozarks). Wood wrote the screenplay from a story idea by Jane Mann. Wood's friend, cameraman William C. Thompson, died around this time.\n\"Orgy of the Dead\".\nWood's 1965 transitional film \"Orgy of the Dead\" (originally titled \"Nudie Ghoulies\") combined the horror and sexploitation genres. Wood handled various production details while Stephen C. Apostolof directed under the pseudonym A. C. Stephen. The film begins with a recreation of the opening scene from \"Night of the Ghouls\". Criswell, wearing one of Lugosi's old capes, rises from his coffin to deliver an introduction taken almost word-for-word from the previous film. Set in a misty graveyard, the Lord of the Dead (Criswell) and his sexy consort, the Black Ghoul (a Vampira look-alike), preside over a series of macabre performances by topless dancers from beyond the grave (recruited by Wood from local strip clubs). Together, Wood and Apostolof went on to make a string of sexploitation films up to 1977. Wood co-wrote the screenplays with Apostolof and occasionally even acted in some of the films.\nIn 1969, Wood appeared in \"The Photographer\" (a.k.a. \"Love Feast\" or \"Pretty Models All in a Row\"), the first of two films produced by a Marine buddy, Joseph F. Robertson, with Wood portraying a photographer using his position to engage in sexual antics with his models.\nWood had a smaller role in Robertson's second film, \"Mrs. Stone's Thing\" (1970), as a transvestite who spends his time at a party trying on lingerie in a bedroom.\nIn 1969, Wood adapted his own novel \"Mama's Diary\" written under the pseudonym Dick Trent into \"Operation Red Light\" for Jacques Descent Production. Over half the footage was destroyed in a film-processing accident and the film is considered lost.\n\"Venus Flytrap\" (1970) aka \"The Revenge of Dr. X\", a US/Japanese co-production, was based on an unproduced Ed Wood screenplay from the 1950s. The film was produced and directed by Sci-Fi pulp writer Norman Earl Thomson. The film involves a mad scientist who uses lightning to transform plants into man-eating monsters. Wood did not participate in the actual making of the movie.\n\"Take It Out in Trade\".\nIn 1970, Wood wrote and directed his own pornographic film, \"Take It Out in Trade\", starring Duke Moore and Nona Carver. Wood played a transvestite named Alecia in the film.\nIn 1970, Wood produced a 45 rpm record which featured Tor Johnson on one side, reading \"The Day The Mummy Returned\", and Criswell reading \"The Final Curtain\" on the other. It has never been determined whether or not the record was actually released, but many of them were definitely produced.\n\"Necromania\".\nIn 1971, Wood produced, wrote and directed \"Necromania\" (subtitled \"A Tale of Weird Love\") under the pseudonym \"Don Miller\". The film was an early entry to the new subgenre of hardcore pornographic films. Thought lost for years, it resurfaced in edited form on Mike Vraney's Something Weird imprint in the late 1980s and was re-released later on DVD by Fleshbot Films in 2005. In the Rudolph Grey biography \"Nightmare of Ecstasy\", Maila Nurmi (\"Vampira\") said she declined Wood's offer to do a nude scene sitting in a coffin for \"Necromania\", claiming she was recovering from a stroke at the time.\nFrom 1971 to 1972, Wood directed an unknown number of short X-rated films produced by the Swedish Erotica film company. These were short 12-minute loops that were silent films with subtitles. Wood was paid $100 for every ten loops he subtitled.\nWood's friends Kenne Duncan and Tor Johnson both passed away during this period. (Wood was named executor of Kenne Duncan's estate, and following Duncan's death, Wood held a small memorial funeral for him with his wife and some friends in his backyard around the swimming pool where they eulogized the departed Western film star.) Wood's friend Duke Moore died in 1976.\nThroughout the 1970s, Wood worked with his friend Stephen C. Apostolof, usually co-writing scripts with him, but also serving as an assistant director and an associate producer. (Together they had made Wood's \"Orgy of the Dead\" back in 1965.) Wood's last known on-screen appearance (a dual role) was in Apostolof's 1974 film \"Fugitive Girls\" (a.k.a. \"Five Loose Women\"), in which he played both a gas station attendant called \"Pops\" and a sheriff on the fugitive women's trail. In 1974, Wood was allegedly on the set of an ultra-low budget film called \"Meatcleaver Massacre\" (1977) and is said to have co-directed at least one scene in the film (uncredited), but his involvement is dubious.\nAt the time of his death, Wood was working on a biographical screenplay based on the last years of actor Bela Lugosi to be called \"Lugosi Post Mortem\", which was supposed to star actor Peter Coe as Lugosi and Karl Johnson as his father Tor Johnson. The nearly completed script was left behind the last time Wood was evicted and is presumed to have been discarded in the trash. Wood was also working on a screenplay for a film called \"Venus De Milo\", a mystery that would explain the famous statue's missing arms.\nTechnically, Wood's last acting job was in the 1978 Stephen Apostolof film \"Hot Ice\". Ed Wood played a janitor in the film, but his scene was cut out at the last minute due to his drunkenness on the set. Wood died soon after this film was made in 1978, at age 54. Apostolof himself stopped making films as well at this time.\nBooks and novels.\nBeginning in 1963 up until his death, Wood wrote at least 80 lurid crime and sex novels in addition to hundreds of short stories and non-fiction pieces for magazines and daily newspapers.\nHis novels include \"Black Lace Drag\" (1963) (reissued in 1965 as \"Killer in Drag\"), \"Orgy of the Dead\" (1965), \"Parisian Passions\" (1966), \"Watts the Difference\" (1966), \"Side-Show Siren\" (1966), \"Drag Trade\" (1967), \"Watts After\" (1967), \"Devil Girls\" (1967), \"It Takes One to Know One\" (1967), \"Death of a Transvestite\" (1967), \"Suburbia Confidential\" (1967), \"Night Time Lez\" (1968), \"The Perverts\" (1968), \"Bye Bye Broadie\" (1968), \"Raped in the Grass\" (1968), \"Sex, Shrouds and Caskets\" (1968), \"Love of the Dead\" (1968), \"The Sexecutives\" (1968), \"Young, Black and Gay\" (1968), \"Hell Chicks\" (1968), \"The Gay Underworld\" (1968), \"Carnival Piece\" (1969), \"Toni, Black Tigress\" (1969), \"Mama's Diary\" (1969), \"To Make a Homo\" (1969), \"Mary-Go-Round\" (1969), \"The Sexual Woman\" (1971), \"The Only House\" (1972), \"A Study of Fetishes and Fantasies\" (1973), \"Tales for a Sexy Night Part 1 and 2\" (1973), \"Sex Star\" (1973), \"Death of a Transvestite Hooker\" (1974). \"Forced Entry\" (1974), and \"TV Lust\" (1977).\nIn 1965, Wood wrote the quasi-memoir \"Hollywood Rat Race\", which was only published years later in 1998. In it, Wood advises new writers to \"just keep on writing. Even if your story gets worse, you'll get better\", and also recounts tales of dubious authenticity, such as how he and Bela Lugosi entered the world of nightclub cabaret.\nThirty-two short stories known to be written by Wood (he sometimes wrote under pseudonyms such as \"Ann Gora\" and \"Dr. T.K. Peters\") are collected in an anthology \"Blood Splatters Quickly\", published by OR Books in 2014.\nUnrealized projects.\nWood's list of unrealized film projects also included scripts called \"Piranhas\" (1957), \"Trial by Terror\" (1958), \"The Peeper\" (a proposed 1960 sequel to \"The Sinister Urge\"), \"Silent Night\" (1961), \"Joaquin Murieta\" (a 1965 biopic about the infamous bandit of the Old West), \"Mice on a Cold Cellar Floor\" (1973), \"Epitaph for the Town Drunk\" (1973), \"To Kill a Saturday Night\" (1973, which was set to star John Carradine), \"The Teachers\" (1973), \"The Basketballers\" (1973), \"The Airline Hostesses\" (1973), \"I Awoke Early the Day I Died\" (1974, a rewrite of Wood's 1961 \"Silent Night\"), \"Heads, No Tails\" (1974, a take-off on Sweeney Todd), and \"Shoot Seven\" (1977, Wood's proposed musical based on the St. Valentine's Day Massacre).\nPersonal life.\nRelationships and marriages.\nWood was in a long-term relationship with actress and songwriter Dolores Fuller, whom he met in late 1952. She was in the process of divorcing her first husband Donald Fuller, with whom she had had two sons. Wood and Fuller shared an apartment for three years, and Wood cast her in three of his films: \"Glen or Glenda\", \"Jail Bait\" and, in a very brief cameo, in \"Bride of the Monster\". Fuller later said she initially had no idea that Wood was a crossdresser and was mortified when she saw Wood dressed as a woman for the first time in \"Glen or Glenda\". The couple broke up in 1955 after Wood cast another actress for the lead role in \"Bride of the Monster\" (Wood originally wrote the part for Fuller but later reduced her part to a brief cameo appearance) and because of Wood's excessive drinking. Fuller relocated to New York City where she embarked on a successful songwriting career, writing for famous singers like Elvis Presley and Nat King Cole. Fuller died on May 9, 2011, at age 88.\nIn 1956, soon after his breakup with Fuller, Wood married actress Norma McCarty. McCarty appeared as Edie, the airplane stewardess, in \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\", and was recently divorced with two sons, Mike and John McCarty, from her earlier marriage. The marriage took Wood's friends by surprise; one night, Wood called everyone to the sound stage for what they thought was a cast party, but when everyone was present, Wood brought out a huge wedding cake and a preacher, and announced he was getting married. The marriage ended approximately one month later after McCarty discovered that Wood was a crossdresser, and while it has been reported that their marriage was annulled, according to film archivist Wade Williams, they neither annulled the marriage nor legally divorced. McCarty died on June 27, 2014, at age 93.\nWood moved in with Paul Marco for a short while after McCarty left him. Later in 1956, Wood met Kathy O'Hara in a bar one night where he was drinking with Bela Lugosi. O'Hara fell in love with Wood immediately; they were married in Las Vegas a short while later, and Wood always considered O'Hara his legal wife despite the fact that his first marriage had not been legally annulled. Wood and O'Hara remained together until Wood's death in December 1978. O'Hara never got along with his mother Lillian, calling her \"a strict disciplinarian\" who damaged Wood psychologically from early childhood. Wood occasionally sent money to his mom in the mail without O'Hara's knowledge.\nAlleged daughter.\nWood was shocked to learn he had fathered a child out of wedlock after World War II with a young woman he had dated while he was in the Marines. According to Conrad Brooks, Wood and his wife Kathy only met the woman (also named Kathy) in 1967 when she was already 21 years old. Born on May 23, 1946, she had been living in Lancaster, California, and had managed to trace her father's whereabouts. Wood's mother Lillian said she had been contacted by the girl back in 1963 when she sent his mother a photo and introduced herself to Lillian as her granddaughter. Lillian said she sent the girl a watch for her graduation in 1964, but never heard back from her.\nThere is a photo of the young woman in Rudolph Grey's biography on Wood.\nShe visited the Woods and stayed over at their house for a couple of days, but apparently the two women did not get along well. In fact, Wood's wife physically threw her out of the house on the second day when she found her sleeping on their sofa.\nWood's wife Kathy never believed that the girl was Wood's daughter, saying in an interview, \"There was never any proof, only the woman's statement on a birth certificate.\" Wood told Kathy that the woman he had sex with in 1946 used to sleep around regularly \"with 10 or 20 other Marines at the base\", so he probably wasn't the girl's father. She said, \"She's \"not\" your daughter, that bitch lied to you! The father could have been anyone. There's only her accusation.\"\nActress Valda Hansen said, \"I met Ed's daughter at his house in the Valley. She looked just like him. Beautiful, delicate. Green eyes, dark chocolate brown hair. She was very sweet.\" Art director Bob Derteno, who worked with Wood on \"Orgy of the Dead\", said that Wood later travelled to attend his daughter's wedding in New York and was later told that he had become a grandfather.\nCross-dressing.\nIn Rudolph Grey's 1992 biography \"Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood Jr.\", Wood's wife Kathy O'Hara recalls that Wood told her that his mother dressed him in girls' clothing as a child. O'Hara stated that Wood's cross-dressing was not a sexual inclination, but rather a neomaternal comfort derived mainly from angora fabric (angora is featured in many of Wood's films). Even in his later years, Wood was not shy about going out in public dressed in drag as \"Shirley\", his female alter ego (a name that appeared in many of his screenplays and stories). In his partly autobiographical film \"Glen or Glenda\", the heterosexual Wood takes pains to emphasize that a male cross-dresser is not automatically also a homosexual. Wood directed many of his pornographic films in drag, but usually would not take the time to shave, which made for a bizarre sight, according to his friends. Wood always swore that he had never had a single homosexual relationship in his life, and was even considered quite a womanizer by many of his acquaintances. He once said that if he could have anything in life, it would be reincarnation as a blonde woman.\nLater years.\nDuring the last 15 years of his life, Wood depended almost entirely on writing pornography novels to earn a living, receiving between $700 to $1,000 per novel which he spent almost immediately on alcohol at the local liquor store. Friends have stated how, in his final years, he eventually stopped bathing, and that his apartment became so filthy that he eventually would not allow friends to come over and visit because he knew they would be horrified to see how unkempt it had become. Paul Marco said Wood was constantly moaning, \"My God, I've given everything away. I should be a millionaire. I should have a million bucks right now!\"\nActor John Agar, an alcoholic himself, was drinking at Wood's apartment one day in the late 1960s when the afternoon news program erroneously announced Agar's obituary. Wood called the studio and told them that Agar was not dead. He told them \"He's alive... he's sitting right here with me now!\". The story was corrected shortly thereafter.\nEd Wood and his wife were routinely evicted from their apartments for non-payment of rent. Each time they moved, Wood would immediately establish credit with the liquor store nearest his new address. Their last apartment was in a high-crime ghetto area \"at the corner of Yucca and Cahuenga\" in Hollywood inhabited by drug addicts, gamblers and prostitutes. Wood, who regularly pawned his typewriters for cash, was mugged regularly when he would stumble down the street to the liquor store. Eventually he had his publisher send his paychecks directly to the various liquor store owners so that he would not have to carry cash when he went there.\nThe Woods' apartment was always in danger of being burglarized. One night, a cross-dresser was beaten to death in the hallway just outside Wood's apartment door and the sound of gunshots outside the building was a nightly occurrence.\nAccording to friends, Wood and his wife often became violent when they drank. Stories abound of the two beating each other; Wood sometimes knocked Kathy unconscious. Criswell commented once, \"I always had the feeling that one would kill the other. And if you were there, the killer would say you did it!\" Nonetheless, years after Wood's death, his wife always professed to love him dearly.\nBela Lugosi biographer Robert Cremer interviewed Wood once in his Yucca apartment for his 1976 book \"Lugosi: The Man Behind the Cape\" two years before Wood died. Cremer said Wood began the interview sober, but quickly became intoxicated over the next hour as the interview proceeded. Cremer said, \"He started getting really angry at me because he felt he was the person who should be writing (the book)... He went out in the kitchen, grabbed a bottle of Wild Turkey... He smashed the bottle on the kitchen counter and then came after me with it. He lunged at me, but he was so drunk, I just pushed him against the wall, and he collapsed. I just walked out the door and said 'Okay Ed, I guess that was our last interview. I'll see you.'\"\nDeath.\nBy 1978, Wood's depression had worsened as he and his wife Kathy O'Hara had both succumbed to alcoholism. They were evicted from their Hollywood apartment on Yucca Street on December 7, 1978, in total poverty by two sheriff's deputies called by their landlord for failure to pay their overdue rent and had to leave behind all of his scrapbooks and unfinished screenplays, which the landlord allegedly threw into a garbage dumpster. Wood's large film collection of his early commercials were also thrown out following his eviction. The couple moved into the small North Hollywood apartment of their friend, actor Peter Coe, located at 5635 Laurel Canyon Boulevard. Wood spent the weekend drinking vodka and desperately calling old friends for money, but to no avail.\nAround noon on Sunday, December 10, Wood felt ill and went to lie down in Coe's bedroom while Coe, O'Hara and a few friends were watching a football game on TV. From the bedroom, he asked O'Hara to bring him a drink, which she refused to do. A few minutes later, he yelled out, \"Kathy, I can't breathe!\", a plea O'Hara ignored as she later said she was tired of Wood bossing her around. After hearing no movement in the bedroom for twenty minutes, O'Hara sent a female friend to check on Wood, who discovered him dead on the bed from a heart attack. O'Hara later said, \"I still remember when I went into that room that afternoon and he was dead, his eyes and mouth were wide open. I'll never forget the look in his eyes. He clutched at the sheets. It looked like he'd seen hell.\"\nWood was cremated at the Utter-McKinley mortuary, and his ashes were scattered at sea. Paul Marco, O'Hara, David DeMering and The Amazing Criswell attended Wood's makeshift memorial service which was held at Peter Coe's apartment following the cremation. Marco recalled how devastated O'Hara was at the time.\nLegacy and homages.\nAt the time of his death, Wood's name and career had become so obscure that most local Los Angeles newspapers, including the entertainment magazine \"Variety\", did not run an obituary about him.\nThe 1982 film \"It Came from Hollywood\" featured a \"Tribute to Ed Wood\" segment.\nIn 1986 in an essay paying homage to Wood in \"Incredibly Strange Films\", Jim Morton wrote: \"Eccentric and individualistic, Edward D. Wood Jr. was a man born to film. [...] Lesser men, if forced to make movies under the conditions Wood faced, would have thrown up their hands in defeat\".\nIn 1994, director Tim Burton released the biopic \"Ed Wood\", starring Johnny Depp in the title role and Martin Landau, who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi. It also won an Academy Award for Best Makeup for Rick Baker. Conrad Brooks appeared in the movie in a cameo role as \"Barman\", along with Gregory Walcott in the role of a potential backer. The film premiered on September 30, 1994, just ten days before what would have been Wood's 70th birthday. Despite receiving critical acclaim, the movie did poorly at the box office; however, it has since developed a cult following.\nIn 1996, Reverend Steve Galindo of Seminole, Oklahoma, created a legally recognized religion with Wood as its official savior. Founded as a joke, the Church of Ed Wood now boasts more than 3,500 baptized followers. Woodites, as Galindo's followers are called, celebrate \"Woodmas\" on October 10, which was Wood's birthday. Numerous parties and concerts are held worldwide to celebrate Woodmas. On October 4\u20135, 2003, horror host Mr. Lobo was canonized as the \"Patron Saint of late night movie hosts and insomniacs\" in the Church of Ed Wood.\nIn 1997 the University of Southern California began holding an annual \"Ed Wood Film Festival\", in which student teams are challenged to write, film, and edit an Ed Wood-inspired short film based on a preassigned theme. Past themes have included \"Rebel Without a Bra\" (2004), \"What's That in Your Pocket?\" (2005), and \"Slippery When Wet\" (2006).\nLost films.\nWood's 1972 film \"The Undergraduate\" was a lost film, as was his 1970 film \"Take It Out in Trade\", but they both eventually turned up years later. (Both films in their entirety are now available on DVD.)\nAn 80-minute print of \"Take It Out in Trade\" was discovered and publicly exhibited at Anthology Film Archives in New York City in September 2014. Silent outtakes from the film were released by Something Weird Video.\nWood's 1971 film \"Necromania\" was also believed lost for years, until an edited version resurfaced at a yard sale in 1992, followed in 2001 by a complete, unedited print.\nA complete print of Wood's lost 1972 pornographic film \"The Young Marrieds\" was discovered in 2004. It was released by Alpha Blue Archives in July 2014 as a part of the four-DVD set \"The Lost Sex Films of Ed Wood Jr.\".\nWood is said to have filmed some scenes of Lon Chaney Jr. in a werewolf costume in Hollywood in 1964 that were said to have been incorporated into Jerry Warren's film \"Face of the Screaming Werewolf\" (1965). Chaney biographer Don G. Smith however has stated that this story was never substantiated."}
{"id": "10522", "revid": "1893804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10522", "title": "EDIF", "text": "EDIF (Electronic Design Interchange Format) is a vendor-neutral format based on S-expressions in which to store electronic netlists and schematics. It was one of the first attempts to establish a neutral data exchange format for the electronic design automation (EDA) industry. The goal was to establish a common format from which the proprietary formats of the EDA systems could be derived. When customers needed to transfer data from one system to another, it was necessary to write translators from one format to other. As the number of formats (\"N\") multiplied, the translator issue became an \"N\"-squared problem. The expectation was that with EDIF the number of translators could be reduced to the number of involved systems.\nRepresentatives of the EDA companies Daisy Systems, Mentor Graphics, Motorola, National Semiconductor, Tektronix, Texas Instruments and the University of California, Berkeley established the \"EDIF Steering Committee\" in November 1983. Later Hilary Kahn, a computer science professor at the University of Manchester, joined the team and led the development from version EDIF 2 0 0 till the final version 4 0 0.\nSyntax.\nThe general format of EDIF involves using parentheses to delimit data definitions, and in this way it superficially resembles Lisp. The basic tokens of EDIF 2.0.0 were keywords (like \"library\", \"cell\", \"instance\", etc.), strings (delimited with double quotes), integer numbers, symbolic constants (e.g. \"GENERIC\", \"TIE\", \"RIPPER\" for cell types) and \"Identifiers\", which are reference labels formed from a very restricted set of characters. \nEDIF 3.0.0 and 4.0.0 dropped the symbolic constants entirely, using keywords instead.\nSo, the syntax of EDIF has a fairly simple foundation. A typical EDIF file looks like this: \n (edifLevel 0) (keywordMap (keywordLevel 0))\n (status (written (timeStamp 1995 1 1 1 1 1) (program \"xxx\" (version \"v1\"))))\n (library xxx (edifLevel 0)\n (technology (numberDefinition (scale 1 (e 1 -6) (unit distance))))\n (cell dff_4 (cellType generic)\n (view view1 (viewType netlist)\n (interface\n (port aset (direction INPUT))\n (port clok (direction INPUT))\n (cell yyy (cellType generic)\n (view schematic_ (viewType netlist)\n (interface\n (port CLEAR (direction INPUT))\n (port CLOCK (direction INPUT)) ... )\n (contents\n (instance I_36_1 (viewRef view1 (cellRef dff_4)))\n (instance (rename I_36_3 \"I$3\") (viewRef view1 (cellRef addsub_4)))\n (net CLEAR\n (joined\n (portRef CLEAR)\n (portRef aset (instanceRef I_36_1))\n (portRef aset (instanceRef I_36_3))))\nRevision history.\nEDIF Version 1 0 0 in 1985\nEDIF Version 1 1 0 in 1986\nEDIF 2 0 0.\nThe first \"real\" public release of EDIF was version 2 0 0, which was approved in March 1988 as the standard ANSI/EIA-548-1988. It is published in a single volume. This version has no formal scope statement but what it tries to capture is covered by the defined viewTypes:\nThe industry tested this release for several years, but finally only the NETLIST view was the one widely used and some EDA tools are still supporting it today for EDIF 2 0 0.\nTo overcome problems with the main 2 0 0 standard several further documents got released:\nEDIF 2 9 0.\nReleased on 15 September 1992.\nEDIF 3 0 0.\nBecause of some fundamental weaknesses in the 2 0 0 release a new not compatible release 3 0 0 was released in September 1993, given the designation of EIA standard EIA-618. It later achieved ANSI and ISO designations. It is published in 4 volumes. The main focus of this version were the viewTypes NETLIST and SCHEMATIC from 2 0 0. MASKLAYOUT, PCBLAYOUT and some other views were dropped from this release and shifted for later releases because the work for these views was not fully completed.\nEDIF 3 0 0 is available from the International Electrotechnical Commission as IEC 61690-1\nEDIF 4 0 0.\nEDIF 4 0 0 was released in late August 1996, mainly to add \"Printed Circuit Board\" extensions (the original PCBLAYOUT view) to EDIF 3 0 0. This more than doubled the size of EDIF 3 0 0, and is published in HTML format on CD.\nEDIF 4 0 0 is available from the International Electrotechnical Commission as IEC 61690-2\nEvolution.\nProblems with 2 0 0.\nTo understand the problems users and vendors encountered with EDIF 2 0 0, one first has to picture all the elements and dynamics of the electronics industry. The people who needed this standard were mainly design engineers, who worked for companies whose size ranged from a house garage to multi-billion dollar facilities with thousands of engineers. These engineers worked mainly from schematics and netlists in the late 1980s, and the big push was to generate the netlists from the schematics automatically. The first suppliers were Electronic Design Automation vendors (e.g., Daisy, Mentor, and Valid formed the earliest predominating set). These companies competed vigorously for their shares of this market.\nOne of the tactics used by these companies to \"capture\" their customers was their proprietary databases. Each had special features that the others did not. Once a decision was made to use a particular vendor's software to enter a design, the customer was ever after constrained to use no other software. To move from vendor A's to vendor B's systems usually meant a very expensive re-entry of almost all design data by hand into the new system. This expense of \"migration\" was the main factor that locked design engineers into using a single vendor.\nBut the \"customers\" had a different desire. They saw immediately that while vendor A might have a really nice analog simulation environment, vendor B had a much better PCB or silicon layout auto-router. And they wished that they could pick and choose amongst the different vendors.\nEDIF was mainly supported by the electronics design end-users, and their companies. The EDA vendors were involved also, but their motivation was more along the lines of wanting to not alienate their customers. Most of the EDA vendors produced EDIF 2 0 0 translators, but they were definitely more interested in generating high-quality EDIF readers, and they had absolutely no motivation at all to write any software that generated EDIF (an EDIF Writer), beyond threats from customers of mass migration to another vendor's software.\nThe result was rather interesting. Hardly any software vendor wrote EDIF 2 0 0 output that did not have severe violations of syntax or semantics. The semantics were just loose enough that there might be several ways to describe the same data. This began to be known as \"flavors\" of EDIF. The vendor companies did not always feel it important to allocate many resources to EDIF products, even if they sold a large number of them. There were several stories of active products with virtually no-one to maintain them for years. User complaints were merely gathered and prioritized. The harder it became to export customer data to EDIF, the more the vendors seemed to like it. Those who did write EDIF translators found they spent a huge amount of time and effort on generating sufficiently powerful, forgiving, artificially intelligent readers, that could handle and piece together the poor-quality code produced by the extant EDIF 2 0 0 writers of the day.\nIn designing EDIF 3 0 0, the committees were well aware of the faults of the language, the calumny heaped on EDIF 2 0 0 by the vendors and the frustration of the end users. So, to tighten the semantics of the language, and provide a more formal description of the standard, the revolutionary approach was taken to provide an information model for EDIF, in the information modeling language EXPRESS. This helped to better document the standard, but was done more as an afterthought, as the syntax crafting was done independently of the model, instead of being generated from the model. Also, even though the standard says that if the syntax and model disagree, the model is the standard, this is not the case in practice. The BNF description of the syntax is the foundation of the language inasmuch as the software that does the day-to-day work of producing design descriptions is based on a fixed syntax. The information model also suffered from the fact that it was not (and is not) ideally suited to describing EDIF. It does not describe such concepts as name spaces very well at all, and the differences between a definition and a reference is not clearly describable either. Also, the constructs in EXPRESS for describing constraints might be formal, but constraint description is a fairly complicated matter at times. So, most constraints ended up just being described as comments. Most of the others became elaborate formal descriptions which most readers will never be able to decipher, and therefore may not stand up to automated debugging/compiling, just as a program might look good in review, but a compiler might find some interesting errors, and actually running the program written might find even more interesting errors. (Additionally, analogous EXPRESS compilers/executors didn't exist when the standard was written, and may not still exist today!)\nSolutions to EDIF 2 0 0 problems.\nThe solution to the \"flavor\" problem of EDIF 2 0 0 was to develop a more specific semantic description in EDIF 3 0 0 (1993). Indeed, reported results of people generating EDIF 3 0 0 translators was that the writers were now \"much\" more difficult to get right, due to the great number of semantic restrictions, and the readers are comparatively trivial to develop.\nThe solution to vendor \"conflict of interest\" was neutral third-party companies, who could provide EDIF products based on vendor interfaces. This separation of the EDIF products from direct vendor control was critical to providing the end-user community with tools that worked well. It formed naturally and without comment. Engineering DataXpress was perhaps the first such company in this realm, with Electronic Tools Company seeming to have captured the market in the mid to late 1990s. Another dynamic in this industry is EDIF itself. Since they have grown to a rather large size, generating readers and writers has become a very expensive proposition. Usually the third-party companies have congregated the necessary specialists and can use this expertise to more efficiently generate the software. They are also able to leverage code sharing and other techniques an individual vendor could not. By 2000, almost no major vendor produced its own EDIF tools, choosing instead to OEM third-party tools.\nSince the release of EDIF 4 0 0, the entire EDIF standards organisation has essentially dissolved. There have been no published meetings of any of the technical subcommittees, the EDIF Experts group, etc. Most of the individuals involved have moved on to other companies or efforts. The newsletter was abandoned, and the Users' Group no longer holds yearly meetings. EDIF 3 0 0 and 4 0 0 are now ANSI, IEC and European (EN) standards. EDIF Version 3 0 0 is IEC/EN 61690-1, and EDIF Version 4 0 0 is IEC/EN 61690-2."}

Essential tremor is either an \"action\" (intention) tremor\u2014it intensifies when one tries to use the affected muscles during voluntary movements such as eating and writing\u2014or it is a \"postural\" tremor, which occurs when holding arms outstretched and against gravity. This means that it is distinct from a resting tremor, such as that caused by Parkinson's disease, which is not correlated with movement. Unlike Parkinson's disease, essential tremor may worsen with action.\nEssential tremor is a progressive neurological disorder, and the most common movement disorder. Though not life-threatening, it can certainly be debilitating. Its onset is usually between 40 and 50 years of age, but it can occur at any age. The cause is poorly understood. Diagnosis is made by observing the typical pattern of the tremor coupled with the exclusion of known causes of such a tremor. There is currently no medical test available to identify an essential tremor.\nWhile essential tremor is distinct from Parkinson's disease, which causes a resting tremor, essential tremor is nevertheless sometimes misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease. Some patients have been found to have both essential tremors and resting tremors.\nTreatments for essential tremor include medications, typically given sequentially to determine which provides the most efficacy with least side effects. \"Clostridium botulinum\" toxin (Botox) injections and ultrasound are also sometimes used for cases refractory to medications.\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe tremors linked with essential tremor are generally action tremors, which means they occur during intentional movements rather than when the body is at rest.\nIn mild cases, ET can manifest as the inability to stop the tongue or hands from shaking, the ability to sing only in vibrato, and difficulty doing small, precise tasks such as threading a needle. Even simple tasks such as cutting in a straight line or using a ruler can range from difficult to impossible, depending on the severity of the condition. In disabling cases, ET can interfere with a person's activities of daily living, including feeding, dressing, and taking care of personal hygiene. Essential tremor generally presents as a rhythmic tremor (4\u201312 Hz) that occurs only when the affected muscle is exerting effort. Any sort of physical or mental stress tends to make the tremor worse.\nThe tremor may also occur in the head (neck), jaw, and voice, as well as other body regions, with the general pattern being that the tremor begins in the arms and then spreads to these other regions in some people. Women are more likely to develop the head tremor than are men and it's also found to be more severe in women than men. In people with essential tremor (ET), the head tremor can be either vertical (\"yes-yes\") or horizontal (\"no-no\") and is typically accompanied by tremors in the hands or voice. Other types of tremor may also occur, including postural tremor of the outstretched arms, intention tremor of the arms, and rest tremor in the arms. In one study, men had more severe postural hand tremor when compared to women. Some people may have unsteadiness and problems with gait and balance. Abnormal tandem gait was more commonly observed in older ET people and those with more than 5 years of disease duration.\nET-related tremors do not occur during sleep, but people with ET sometimes complain of an especially coarse tremor upon awakening that becomes noticeably less coarse within the first few minutes of wakefulness. Tremor and disease activity can intensify in response to fatigue, strong emotions, low blood sugar, extreme cold and heat, caffeine, lithium salts, some antidepressants, stress, and other factors.\nParkinson's disease and parkinsonism can also occur simultaneously with ET. The degree of tremor, rigidity, and functional disability did not differ from patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Hand tremor predominated (as it did in Parkinson's disease), and occurred in nearly all cases, followed by head tremor, voice tremor, neck, face, leg, tongue, and trunk tremor. Most other tremors occurred in association with hand tremor. More severe tremors, a lower sleep disorder frequency, and a similar prevalence of other non-motor symptoms also can occur. A non-motor feature such as hearing impairment has been shown to have higher prevalence in those with ET compared with those that are healthy or with Parkinson's. Cochlear pathologies which affects the inner ear are proposed as the potential cause, but there is still insufficient information regarding retrocochlear pathologies (affects central or neural nerve) and central auditory processing.\nWalking difficulties in essential tremor are common. About half of patients have associated dystonia, including cervical dystonia, writer's cramp, spasmodic dysphonia, and cranial dystonia, and 20% of the patients had associated parkinsonism. Olfactory dysfunction (loss of sense of smell) is common in Parkinson's disease, and has also been reported to occur in patients with essential tremor. A number of patients with essential tremor also exhibit many of the same neuropsychiatric disturbances seen in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The similarity in characteristics between parkinsonism and essential tremor can make it difficult to distinguish between the two at times.\nEssential tremor with tremor onset after the age of 65 has been associated with mild cognitive impairment, as well as dementia, although the link between these conditions, if any, is still not understood. Familial cases of ET tend to present at younger ages, whereas older ages of onset are linked to faster progression of the disease.\nEssential tremor has two tremor components, central and peripheral. These two tremor components were identified by measuring the tremor of ET patients once with no weights on their hands and then with 1-pound weights on their hands. The addition of the weights resulted in a tremor spectrum with two peaks, one that maintained the same frequency (the central tremor) and one that decreased in frequency (the peripheral tremor). Only with the addition of the weights was the peripheral tremor distinguishable from the central tremor.\nThe frequency of essential tremor is 4 to 12\u00a0Hz, depending on which body segment is affected. Previously, it was 4 to 11\u00a0Hz according to the American Family Physician on Classification of Tremors and Treatment Update. Proximal segments are affected at lower frequencies, and distal segments are affected at higher frequencies.\nCause.\nEssential Tremor was once thought to be a single disease state, however, research shows that there are multiple factors that are associated with causing Essential Tremor. This leads to the consideration that Essential Tremor is more akin to a family of diseases, due to the presence of both genetic (familial) and sporadic Essential Tremors. Currently, there are multiple main hypotheses behind Essential Tremor, being the degeneration of the cerebellum, inheriting the tremor, ingestion of toxins, or the presence of Lewy Bodies in the brainstem. However, \"post mortem\" studies showed that only a small number of patients had Lewy Bodies, and was more common for patients not to exhibit them.\nCerebellar\nIt is unknown how the degeneration of the cerebellum leads to Essential Tremor, however, it is hypothesized that it may be due to the loss of Purkinje cells, as they release gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter meant to control the firing of neurons in the cerebellum. In certain Essential Tremor clinical studies which augment the GABA pathway, only some participants exhibited a reduction of tremor. Some patients have responded to alcohol, claiming alcohol has reduced the tremor, however the reduction is only short term. However, alcohol might only be beneficial for those with an impacted GABA pathway, and may not be benefit patients who developed the tremor via other pathways.\nGenetic.\nThe main underlying cause of essential tremor is not clear, but many cases seem to be familial. About half of the cases are due to a genetic mutation and the pattern of inheritance is most consistent with autosomal dominant transmission, meaning patients with Essential Tremor have around a 50% chance to pass it on to their children. There are multiple gene mutations and presentations on various chromosomes that lead to Essential Tremor. These include genes present on chromosomes 1\u20133, 6, 11, and 16. Each presentation or mutation of different genes were associated with families from different regions. For example, presentation of a gene associated with Essential Tremor on chromosome 6 has been noted in North American families, while a Canadian family was noted with mutations in the fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS) gene. Other mutations in genes such as the HTRA Serine Peptidase 2 (HTRA2) and the teneurin transmembrane protein 4 (TENM4), have been observed in a Turkish family and the Spanish population respectively. Recent \"post mortem\" studies have displayed alterations in the leucine-rich repeat and immunoglobulin-like domain-containing protein 1 (\"LINGO1\") gene and GABA receptors in the cerebellum of people with essential tremor. \"HAPT1 \"mutations have also been linked to ET, as well as to Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy.\nPoisons and toxins.\nSome environmental poisons, including toxins, are also under active investigation, as they may play a role in the disease's cause. Heavy metal exposure, specifically lead, has been associated with causation of ET. Lead is a heavy metal that can cross the central nervous system's (CNS) main line of defense, the blood\u2013brain barrier, even increasing its permeability, allowing other harmful substances to access the CNS. This allows lead access to the CNS allowing it to disturb processes that utilize calcium, including synaptic activity, and causes intracellular disruption, both of which may lead to irreversible damage to the CNS. This would include cerebellar damage which could cause ET. There are other poisons that work in a similar manner to lead such as other heavy metals like mercury and aluminum, as well as toxic chemicals like certain pesticides and alcohol. In particular, excessive alcohol consumption can worsen essential tremor due to damage to the cerebellum.\nPathophysiology.\nEssential tremor is one of the most prevalent and poorly-understood neurological disorders. Clinical, physiological and imaging studies point to involvement of the cerebellum and/or cerebellothalamocortical circuits. The traditional model for essential tremor, the olivary hypothesis, suggests that ET is caused by abnormal electrical activity in the inferior olivary nucleus. This activity makes neurons fire in a regular, synchronized way, which then disrupts signals to the cerebellum and leads to tremors. However, recent studies, especially those examining brain tissue, propose a new hypothesis that ET may be a neurodegenerative disease focused in the cerebellum, differing from the old theory. Changes in the cerebellum could also be mediated by alcoholic beverage consumption. Purkinje cells are especially susceptible to ethanol excitotoxicity. Impairment of Purkinje synapses is a component of cerebellar degradation that could underlie essential tremor. Some cases have Lewy bodies in the locus ceruleus. ET cases that progress to Parkinson's disease are less likely to have had cerebellar problems. Recent neuroimaging studies have suggested that the efficiency of the overall brain functional network in ET is disrupted.\nIn 2012, the National Toxicology Program concluded that sufficient evidence exists of an association between blood lead exposure at levels &gt;10 \u03bcg/dl and essential tremor in adults, and limited evidence at blood lead levels &gt;5 \u03bcg/dl.\nDiagnosis.\nUsually, the diagnosis is established on clinical grounds. Although ET was long considered a single-symptom illness, recent studies have shown that some patients also experience other additional motor symptoms and non-motor features. According to recent medical literature, besides isolated essential tremor, there are two additional classifications: 'ET plus' and 'ET-PD.' 'ET plus' is diagnosed when patients show cognitive impairments or other motor symptoms like ataxia, dystonia, or resting tremor. 'ET-PD' is used for those who meet the criteria for both ET and Parkinson's disease. The clinical features of tremor in a patient include medical history (such as age of onset, family history, progression over time, and exposure to drugs or toxins), tremor characteristics (like which parts of the body are affected, when the tremor occurs, and its frequency), and any associated signs(such as signs of systemic illness, neurological signs, and soft signs). For some types of tremors, additional tests like recording tremor frequency, imaging for lesions, receptor imaging, and biomarkers in blood or tissue may help identify the cause. Tremors can start at any age, from birth through advanced ages (senile tremor). Any voluntary muscle in the body may be affected, although the tremor is most commonly seen in the hands and arms and slightly less commonly in the neck (causing the person's head to shake), tongue, and legs. A resting tremor of the hands is sometimes present. Tremor occurring in the legs might be diagnosable as orthostatic tremor. Tremors in the lower limbs are quite rare in ET and are more likely to indicate Parkinson's disease.\nET occurs within multiple neurological disorders besides Parkinson's disease. This includes migraine disorders, where co-occurrences between ET and migraines have been examined.\nTreatment.\nTreatment approaches.\nCurrently, most treatments and therapies available for essential tremors are only treating symptoms since there is no cure available. Medical treatments for tremors are based on shared decisions between patients and their providers. The choices of treatments depended on tremor severity, affected body parts, and the impacts of tremor on the patient's physical, psychological, and quality of life. People with mild tremors that do not interfere with daily activities and psychological well-being do not require pharmacological treatments. People with persistent tremors which impact daily functions and social interactions should be treated with the appropriate pharmacological therapies.\nNon-pharmacological Treatment.\n\"Focused Ultrasound\" is a treatment that was approved for coverage in the U.S. in 2022 for those with Medicare insurance. Totally non-surgical, the treatment process is performed on a conscious patient and takes 2 to 3 hours.\nThe first approach in helping people to improve tremor symptoms is the discontinuation of triggering and exacerbating factors like medications including certain antidepressants, anti-epileptics, beta-agonists; or substances like caffeine. In addition, getting adequate sleep and utilizing relaxation techniques can also help improve and reduce tremor symptoms in individuals who reported an increase in tremors following physical activities.\nSince tremors can affect different parts of the body (like limbs, head, chin/jaw, and vocal), different non-pharmacological therapeutic techniques are available that can support patients with the management of tremors including occupational therapy, speech therapy, and psychotherapy. Occupational therapy provides support to help people manage everyday tasks more easily through different approaches and interventions. Speech therapy is helpful in people with vocal tremor to help manage and maintain the vocal changes associated with tremor symptoms. Psychological impacts like embarrassment and anxiety are also important concerns of many people with ET which can lead to social isolation and depression. Psychotherapy can be very beneficial and play a key role in helping people to improve the mental health of ET people.\nAlcohol.\nAlcohol had been known to help provide short-term relief of tremor symptoms in some people, however, the therapeutic effects of alcohol on ET had not been studied in many clinical trials. It has been proposed that alcohol can help reduce tremors through the agonism mechanism of the gamma-aminobutyric acid GABAergic. Since GABA can decrease neural activity, it is believed that alcohol can increase the activity of GABA which then can reduce involuntary muscle movements or tremors. However, the duration of action of alcohol on ET is around 3\u20134 hours, alcohol also had been associated with the rebound of tremor, not to mention the risk of development of long-term alcohol consumption and abuse. The use of alcohol as a possible treatment for ET is not recommended by healthcare providers.\nPharmacological Treatments.\nCurrently, The available pharmacological therapy options for ET are Beta-adrenergic blockers, Anticonvulsants, Benzodiazepines/GABAergic agents, Calcium channel blockers, and Atypical neuroleptic agents. The two most effective medications which had been approved by the FDA as first line agents for the treatment of ET are propranolol and primidone.\nBeta-adrenergic Blockers.\nWhen symptoms are sufficiently troublesome to warrant treatment, the first choice medication is propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, which has been shown effective in reducing tremor by 70% in 50% of patients in clinical studies. Based on the guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology and the Italian Movement Disorders Association, propranolol is most effective in limb tremors, also there is little to no effect on head tremors. The recommended doses of propranolol range from 60 to 360\u00a0mg daily, and it is based on the patient's specific factors. The commonly reported side effects of propranolol are bradycardia, bronchospasm, fatigue, and hypotension. In patients that have contraindicated comorbidities to propranolol, other beta-blockers such as Atenolol, pindolol, Sotalol, and nadolol have shown some potential efficacy, but they are not very well studied and have limited evidence in their efficacy on the treatment of ET.\nAnticonvulsants.\nPrimidone is another first line agent recommended in the treatment of ET. Primidone is an anticonvulsant which metabolized into phenobarbital and phenylethymalnonamide. This medication has shown the same beneficial effects in reducing tremors as propranolol and is recommended for use based on guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology and the MDS Task Force on Tremor. The initial dose of primidone is recommended at 25\u00a0mg per day and should be increased up to the maximum dose of 250\u00a0mg per day. This strategy was recommended to help avoid the possible side effects of nausea, vomiting, and excessive sedation of primidone. Primidone is the preferred medication for the treatment of ET in the geriatric population compared to propranolol. In addition, Combination therapy of both Propranolol and Primidone is recommended for people who do not show benefits from either propranolol or primidone as monotherapy.\nTopiramate is an antiepileptic medication which had been studied to assess the efficacy and safety in the treatment of ET. Overall, it is considered a second-line therapy alone or in combination with other medications when first-line treatments fail to show improvement or medication intolerance. Topiramate has been shown effective in reducing limb tremors at the maximum dose of 200\u00a0mg, however, there was a higher risk for the development of adverse effects including weight loss, anorexia, cognitive impairment, and kidney stones.\nOther second-line medications.\nAdditional medications that have been reported to show efficacy in treating ET are gabapentin, benzodiazepines such as alprazolam, clonazepam, and zonisamide, and pregabalin. However, most of the medications have limited evidence-based to support their clinical usage as treatments for ET. Some systematic reviews of medications for the treatment of ET have been conducted. A 2017 review of topiramate found limited data and low-quality evidence to support its efficacy and the occurrence of treatment-limiting adverse effects, a 2017 review of zonisamide found insufficient information to assess efficacy and safety, and a 2016 review of pregabalin determined the effects to be uncertain due to the low quality of evidence.\nBotulinum Toxin (BoNT).\nBotulinum toxin is a neurotoxin produced by a gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria called Clostridium botulinum. BoNT works by inhibiting acetylcholine release at the presynaptic terminal by inactivating the SNARE proteins, which interfere with muscle contraction. BoNT type A injections have shown benefits in several clinical trials for the treatments of limb, voice, and head. However, the associated side effects included muscle weakness, stiffness reported within studies of limb tremors, and neck muscle pain, weakness, and dysphagia in clinical trials of head tremors. Botulinum toxin type A has been found to be helpful in treating voice tremors.\nAdditional procedures.\nUltrasound.\nAdditionally, MRI-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound is a nonsurgical treatment option for people with essential tremor who are medication refractory. MRI-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound does not achieve healing, but can improve the quality of life by reducing the tremor manifestation. While its long-term effects are not yet established, the improvement in tremor score from baseline was durable at 1 year and 2 years following the treatment. To date, reported adverse events and side effects have been mild to moderate. Possible adverse events include gait difficulties, balance disturbances, paresthesias, headache, skin burns with ulcerations, skin retraction, scars, and blood clots. This procedure is contraindicated in pregnant women, persons who have non-MRI compatible implanted metallic devices, allergy to MR contrast agents, cerebrovascular disease, abnormal bleeding, hemorrhage and/or blood clotting disorders, advanced kidney disease or on dialysis, heart conditions, severe hypertension, and ethanol or substance abuse, among others. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Insightec's Exablate Neuro system to treat essential tremor in 2016.\nDeep Brain Stimulation (DBS).\nAnother invasive surgical treatment of essential tremor is deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS is a surgical procedure that involves the placement of a permanent electrode with 4-8 contacts within the brain with connecting wires connected to a pulse stimulator implanted near the patient's collarbone. In the treatment of tremor, the electrodes are placed in the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) of the thalamus.\nThe pulse stimulator delivers constant electrical pulses to the target area, which interfere with activity of the target area, which has been shown to improve tremor symptoms. At one year following the surgical intervention with DBS, patients showed 66% improvement and 48% improvement at 10 years. DBS is considering an effective surgical treatment of ET, but there are associated side effects and complications that have been reported with DBS in clinical trials, including imbalance or gait instability, dystonia, paresthesia, hemorrhage.\nPrognosis.\nAlthough essential tremor is often mild, people with severe tremor have difficulty performing many of their routine activities of daily living. ET is generally progressive in most cases (sometimes rapidly, sometimes very slowly), and can be disabling in severe cases.\nEpidemiology.\nEssential tremor (ET) is a common neurological disorder, affecting up to 5% of the global population, with approximately 24.91 million people affected worldwide in 2020. The prevalence of ET increases significantly with age, particularly in individuals aged 60 and above. It affects around 4% of people aged 40 and older, and the prevalence rises to 2.87% in those over 80, reaching up to 20% in individuals in their 90s and beyond. ET is more common in males than females across all age groups.\nFamily history plays a significant role in the development of ET, with around 50% of cases being hereditary and a 90% concordance rate in identical twins. While the likelihood of developing ET increases with age, it can also occur in younger individuals, especially if there is a family history of the disorder. ET is one of the most common types of tremor, aside from enhanced physiological tremor, and is among the most frequently observed movement disorders.\nSociety and culture.\nActress Katharine Hepburn (1907\u20132003) had an essential tremor, possibly inherited from her grandfather, that caused her head\u2014and sometimes her hands\u2014to shake. The tremor was noticeable by the time of her performance in the 1979 film \"The Corn Is Green\", when critics mentioned the \"palsy that kept her head trembling\". Hepburn's tremor worsened in her later life.\nCharles M. Schulz, American cartoonist and creator of the \"Peanuts\" comic strip, was affected during the last two decades of his life.\nWest Virginia Senator Robert Byrd also had essential tremor.\nIn 2010, musician Daryl Dragon of The Captain and Tennille was diagnosed with essential tremor, with the condition becoming so severe that Dragon was no longer able to play the keyboards.\nDirector-writer-producer-comedian Adam McKay was diagnosed with essential tremor.\n\"Downton Abbey\" creator Julian Fellowes has the condition, as does the show's character Charlie Carson.\nIn 2022, Matthew Caws of Nada Surf and his son made a PSA called \"Living with a Mild Essential Tremor\".\nResearch.\nHarmaline is a widely used model of essential tremor (ET) in rodents. Harmaline is thought to act primarily on neurons in the inferior olive. Olivocerebellar neurons exhibit rhythmic excitatory action when harmaline is applied locally.\nHarmane or harmaline has been implicated not only in essential tremors, but is also found in greater quantities in the brain fluid of people with Parkinson's disease and cancer. Higher levels of the neurotoxin are associated with greater severity of the tremors. Harmane is particularly abundant in meats, and certain cooking practices (e.g., long cooking times) increase its concentration, but at least one study has shown that harmane blood concentrations do not go up after meat consumption in ET patients with already elevated harmane levels, whereas the control group's harmane levels increase accordingly, suggesting that another factor, such as a metabolic defect, may be responsible for the higher harmane levels in ET patients.\nCaprylic acid is being researched as a possible treatment for essential tremor. It has currently been approved by the FDA and designated as GRAS, and is used as a food additive and has been studied as part of a ketogenic diet for treatment of epilepsy in children. Research on caprylic acid as a possible treatment for ET began because researchers recognized that ethanol was effective in reducing tremor, and because of this, they looked into longer-chain alcohols reducing tremor. They discovered that 1-octanol reduced tremor and did not have the negative side effects of ethanol. Pharmacokinetic research on 1-octanol lead to the discovery that 1-octanol metabolized into caprylic acid in the body and that caprylic acid actually was the tremor-reducing agent. Many studies of the effects of caprylic acid on essential tremor have been done, including a dose-escalation study on ET patients and a study testing the effects of caprylic acid on central and peripheral tremor. The dose-escalation study examined doses of 8\u00a0mg/kg to 128\u00a0mg/kg and determined that these concentrations were safe with mild side effects. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached in this study. The study testing the effects of caprylic acid on central and peripheral tremors determined that caprylic acid reduced both.\nTerminology.\nThis type of tremor is often referred to as \"kinetic tremor\". Essential tremor has been known as \"benign essential tremor\", but the adjective \"benign\" has been removed in recognition of the sometimes disabling nature of the disorder."}
{"id": "10529", "revid": "390477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10529", "title": "Book of Enos", "text": "The Book of Enos () is the fourth book in the Book of Mormon and is a portion of the small plates of Nephi. According to the text it was written by Enos, a Nephite prophet. Most scholars believe it to be a 19th century work by Joseph Smith.\nIdentity of Enos According to the Book of Mormon, Jacob had a son named \"Enos\" (see Jacob 7:27) and the Book of Enos follows immediately after the Book of Jacob in the manuscripts of the Book of Mormon and all printed editions. (See Jacob 7:27 to Enos 1:1.) However, in the opening verse of the Book of Enos (Enos 1:1), Enos mentions only his \"father\" and does not expressly affirm that his father was Jacob or that his uncle was Nephi. It is a reasonable assumption that Enos was the son of Jacob (of Jacob 7:27); but that relationship is not established in the text.\nGiven the issues that have been debated about how it could have been fully 179 years between the time when Lehi (and Nephi) left Jerusalem and when Enos \"began to be old\" (Enos 1:25) and was \"soon\" to \"go to the place of [his] rest\" (Enos 1:27), it is possible either that Jacob and Enos each lived to about 95 years of age, with Jacob fathering Enos late in life, or that Jacob had one son named Enos (as stated in Jacob 7:27) and yet that the Enos of the Book of Enos was another Enos altogether, perhaps, for example, a grandson or even great-grandson of Jacob. The identity of Enos of the Book of Enos is not necessarily established as the son of Jacob and grandson of Lehi and Sariah. Clearly, however, Enos's ancestry leads directly to Lehi and Sariah through Jacob.\nSummary of the Book of Enos This short book consists of a single chapter, relating Enos' conversion after praying all day and all night, following with his subsequent dialogue with the Lord. It also discusses the redemption of the Nephites and their enemies, the Lamanites, and contains prophecies of future Nephite and Lamanite generations. Additionally, it contains descriptions of the Lamanites. The style of Enos resembles that of Erich Auerbach in his \"\" and that of Nephi, Enos's ancestor and the Book of Mormon's opening narrator.\nNarrative.\nEnos hunts in the woods and remembers the gospel that his father taught him; as a result, he kneels and cries all day and during the night for the salvation of his soul. Then the voice of God tells Enos that he is forgiven of his sins. Enos believes the voice, but he wonders how the forgiveness is actually accomplished. In response, God explains that Enos is forgiven because he has faith in Jesus Christ, even though he has never seen or heard Christ.\nEnos then prays for the salvation of the Nephites, but God says they will be blessed or punished according to their obedience. Enos, fearing that the Nephites will refuse to obey the commandments of God, then prays for the Lamanites who oppress them; he asks God for the Lamanites' preservation. Additionally, he prays that God will preserve a record of the Nephites so that someday the Lamanites too might be brought to salvation. Only faith in Christ will save them, but God makes a covenant with Enos that he will bring the records of the Nephites to the Lamanites in due time.\nAfter this experience, Enos takes up the mantle of prophet and preaches among the Nephites, fearing their destruction. In the record, Enos does not say whether he is successful at converting the Nephites, but he does say the Nephites fail to convert the Lamanites. Before Enos dies he gives the records to his son Jarom.\nPortrayal of Lamanites.\nThroughout the narrative, Enos characterizes the Lamanites as possessing an unmoving hatred. According to Enos, the Lamanites become a wild, idolatrous, and bloodthirsty people, eating predatory animals. They live in tents, wander around in the wilderness, wear loincloths, shave their heads, and often eat raw meat. Enos explains that they are skilled with bows, cimeters, and axes and continually seek to destroy the Nephites.\nFatimah Salleh and Margaret Olsen Hemming noticed that Enos implies that Lamanite practices, like eating raw meat, connote corruption, even though the same behavior had no negative connotations earlier in the Book of Mormon when the Nephites and Lamanites were still one people. Thus, Enos demonstrates \"writer's bias.\" Hemming and Salleh concluded that Enos's criticism of the Lamanites is based more on prejudice and what is culturally acceptable to the Nephite rather than based on a charge from God.\nBook of Enos interpretation.\nEnos begins his account in a manner that is similar to Nephi's: he mentions parental influence, passed on through religious counsel. The narrative not only begins with this but also ends with it. A difference from the style of Nephi is that Enos does not quote scripture in his narrative. Terryl L. Givens also argues that Enos' intended literary audience leans toward the Lamanites, as the Nephites will eventually be destroyed.\nAccording to author Dennis Largey, the style of the Book of Enos implies that Enos did not narrate it over a long period of time but may have narrated it shortly before he died. On another note, literary critic Richard Rust compares the style and syntax of the Book of Enos and that of Erich Auerbach's \"\" account of when Abraham is about to sacrifice Isaac. Specifically, Rust noticed in both accounts similar uses of modifiers as well as \u201cand.\u201d Additionally, Enos fills his narrative with words such as \"wrestling\" that generally appeal to a reader's emotions, says Protestant theologian John Christopher Thomas. The familial and covenantal responsibilities that Enos feels bring a serious but personal flavor into the narrative, according to BYU English professor Sharon J. Harris."}
{"id": "10530", "revid": "5229428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10530", "title": "Environmental skepticism", "text": "Environmental skepticism is the belief that statements by environmentalists, and the environmental scientists who support them, are false or exaggerated. The term is also applied to those who are critical of environmentalism in general. It can additionally be defined as doubt about the authenticity or severity of environmental degradation. Environmental skepticism is closely linked with anti-environmentalism and climate change denial. Environmental skepticism can also be the result of cultural and lived experiences.\nAbout.\nEnvironmental skeptics have argued that the extent of harm coming from human activities is less certain than scientists and scientific bodies say, or that it is too soon to be introducing curbs in these activities on the basis of existing evidence, or that further discussion is needed regarding who should pay for such environmental initiatives. One of the themes the movement focuses on is the idea that environmentalism is a growing threat to social and economic progress and the civil liberties.\nThe popularity of the term was enhanced by Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg's 2001 book \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\". Lomborg approached environmental claims from a statistical and economic standpoint, and concluded that often the claims made by environmentalists were overstated. Lomborg argued, on the basis of cost\u2013benefit analysis, that few environmentalist claims warranted serious concern. The book came under criticism by scientists noting that Lomborg misinterpreted or misrepresented data, criticized misuse of data while committing similar mistakes himself, examined issues supporting his thesis while ignoring information contrary to it, cherry picks literature, oversimplifies, fails to discuss uncertainty or subjectivity, cites mostly media sources, and largely ignores ecology.\nMichael Shermer, who debated Lomborg on several topics from his book, notes that despite the scientific consensus many people are driven to environmental skepticism by the extremism inherent in both sides of the debate and not having been exposed to a sufficiently succinct and visual presentation of the available evidence.\nIn 2010, Lomborg refined his position and stated that he believes in the need for \"tens of billions of dollars a year to be invested in tackling climate change\" and declared global warming to be \"undoubtedly one of the chief concerns facing the world today\" and \"a challenge humanity must confront\". He summarized his position, saying \"Global warming is real - it is man-made and it is an important problem. But it is not the end of the world.\"\nA 2014 study of individuals from 32 countries found that environmental skepticism stems from insufficient education, self-assessed knowledge, religious/conservative values, lack of trust in society, mistrust of science, and other concerns trumping environmental concern.\nClimate change skepticism.\nAccording to an annual poll conducted by the Pew Research Center, global warming has been a low public priority, ranking 29 out of 30 in the top priorities for the United States President and Congress. Additionally, in a list of 20 policy priorities, it ranks 19th.\nClimate skeptics represent about a third of Americans according to national polls. This number makes it challenging for decision-makers who hesitate to implement environmental policies related to global warming and climate change. Anthony Leiserowitz, a professor from Yale, determined that the American community's attitude towards climate change fall on a scale from concerned or alarmed to disengaged or dismissive. The term climate skeptic is made up of numerous components such as dubious, doubtful, dismissive, and denial. It does not describe simply a non-believer. In a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, 61% of the public believed there was evidence of global warming. However, 35% of the public still believed there was no significant evidence for global temperature rise.\nClimate skepticism is considered to be strictly an American belief constructed of governmental fear, scientific distrust, and interests in resource extraction that support a dominant Western lifestyle. Academics argue that we need to understand Americans underlying ideologies before we denote someone as a skeptic.\nA cultural study on Maryland's Eastern Shore helped discern some of the differing beliefs of Americans about environmental change. The study included three groups of residents who are dependent on the Eastern Shore of Maryland: commercial fishermen, farmers, and recent migrants. The research conducted was determined to gain a consensus of shared knowledge between the subgroups in regard to the changing environment. Along the scale from denial to concerned, it was found that a majority of respondents noticed climate change but believed that humans were not the cause of it. About a third of the respondents were unaware of it, while the rest of the interlocutors were either dismissive of it or somewhat concerned.\nOne of the cultural models found in this research was that climate change was natural. The respondents interpreted the changes such as rising sea-levels and drought as cycles of nature. They explained them as natural processes in the Earth's evolution not affected by humans. They expressed doubt about human induced climate change but acknowledged the changing environment around them. The residents of the Eastern Shore question the legitimacy of the buildup of greenhouse gases from our use of fossil fuels, which cause sea level rise or glacial melting. Part of this hesitation comes from the knowledge passed down through their families and the stories of weather cycles from previous relatives, all who lived in the same area for generations. This concept of nature going through cycles is culturally significant to the groups living in the area.\nThe respondents also make note that climate change may have been newly identified by scientists but has been a phenomenon that has been with us from the beginning of time and not with the onset of the industrial revolution. This reinforces the belief that climate change is happening, just not because of humans. Therefore, when contemporary theories of climate change challenge respondents\u2019 longstanding traditional cultural models, the latter tends to emerge as the more likely outcome.\nThe respondents also believe that if climate change becomes apparent to politicians as a human-induced problem, that will lead to regulations being placed on them. They do not believe that climate policies will benefit them and are therefore unlikely to support such programs. They are concerned more with policies and regulations rather than climate change in the area. They see themselves as living with the climate instead of the common approach of overcoming or conquering it. Living with the climate is viewed as nature and society being connected and sharing a relationship where humans must change their activities to fit the changing climate.\nCommunicating with people who are labeled as skeptics can help create policies that may not be rejected. These beliefs are deeply rooted in longstanding traditions and not influenced by right wing think tanks or other media platforms. Therefore, communicating and working with these people may help reduce the amount of time it will take for policies to be accepted and approved by them. For policy makers to be effective, they should consider the knowledge that these people have and work with them instead of imposing a top-down approach for climate change policy.\nCriticism.\nAccording to \"The Guardian\", such widespread skeptical doubts have not developed independently, but have been \"encouraged by lobbying and PR campaigns financed by the polluting industries\". Supporters of environmentalists argue that \"skepticism\" implies a form of denialism, and that, in the US particularly, \"large donations [have been made] to Senators and Congressmen and [have] sponsored neoliberal think tanks and contrarian scientific research. ExxonMobil, the oil major, has been accused by Friends of the Earth and others of giving millions of dollars to a long list of think-tanks and lobbyists opposed to Kyoto.\"\nA study from 2008 showed that the overwhelming majority of environmentally skeptical books published since the 1970s were either written or published by authors or institutions affiliated with right-wing think tanks. It concludes that \"scepticism is a tactic of an elite-driven counter-movement designed to combat environmentalism, and that the successful use of this tactic has contributed to the weakening of US commitment to environmental protection.\"\nPeter Jacques wrote, \"The skeptical environmental counter-movement is a civic problem and in dealing with the propositions from the counter-movement we are forced to reach down to the bedrock issues of epistemology, identities, articulation and other core work for politics. To use scientism as a hammer against the screw of skepticism will split the wood of public life into splinters or it will immobilize the hammer. Scientism is a modernist tool that will haplessly reshuffle the old excursions - and we all know the 'master's tools will not dismantle the master's house\""}

{"id": "10553", "revid": "1224855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10553", "title": "Flute", "text": "The flute is a member of a family of musical instruments in the woodwind group. Like all woodwinds, flutes are aerophones, producing sound with a vibrating column of air. Flutes produce sound when the player's air flows across an opening. In the Hornbostel\u2013Sachs classification system, flutes are edge-blown aerophones. A musician who plays the flute is called a flautist or flutist.\nPaleolithic flutes with hand-bored holes are the earliest known identifiable musical instruments. A number of flutes dating to about 53,000 to 45,000 years ago have been found in the Swabian Jura region of present-day Germany, indicating a developed musical tradition from the earliest period of modern human presence in Europe. While the oldest flutes currently known were found in Europe, Asia also has a long history with the instrument. A playable bone flute discovered in China is dated to about 9,000 years ago. The Americas also had an ancient flute culture, with instruments found in Caral, Peru, dating back 5,000 years and in Labrador dating back about 7,500 years.\nThe bamboo flute has a long history, especially in China and India. Flutes have been discovered in historical records and artworks starting in the Zhou dynasty (1046\u2013256 BC). The oldest written sources reveal the Chinese were using the kuan (a reed instrument) and hsio (or xiao, an end-blown flute, often of bamboo) in the 12th\u201311th centuries BC, followed by the chi (or ch'ih) in the 9th century BC and the y\u00fceh in the 8th century BC. Of these, the bamboo chi is the oldest documented transverse flute.\nMusicologist Curt Sachs called the cross flute (Sanskrit: v\u0101\u1e43\u015b\u012b) \"the outstanding wind instrument of ancient India\", and said that religious artwork depicting \"celestial music\" instruments was linked to music with an \"aristocratic character\". The Indian bamboo cross flute, Bansuri, was sacred to Krishna, who is depicted with the instrument in Hindu art. In India, the cross flute appeared in reliefs from the 1st century AD at Sanchi and Amaravati from the 2nd\u20134th centuries AD.\nAccording to historian Alexander Buchner, there were flutes in Europe in prehistoric times, but they disappeared from the continent until flutes arrived from Asia by way of \"North Africa, Hungary, and Bohemia\". The end-blown flute began to be seen in illustration in the 11th century. Transverse flutes entered Europe through Byzantium and were depicted in Greek art about 800 AD. The transverse flute had spread into Europe by way of Germany, and was known as the German flute.\nEtymology and terminology.\nThe word \"flute\" first appeared in the English language during the Middle English period, as \"floute\", \"flowte\", or \"flo(y)te\", possibly from Old French \"flaute\" and Old Proven\u00e7al \"fla\u00fct\", or possibly from Old French \"fle\u00fcte\", \"fla\u00fcte\", \"flahute\" via Middle High German \"floite\" or Dutch \"fluit\". The English verb \"flout\" has the same linguistic root, and the modern Dutch verb \"fluiten\" still shares the two meanings. Attempts to trace the word back to the Latin \"flare\" (to blow, inflate) have been called \"phonologically impossible\" or \"inadmissable\". The first known use of the word \"flute\" was in the 14th century. According to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", this was in Geoffrey Chaucer's \"The Hous of Fame\", .\nA musician who plays any instrument in the flute family can be called a flutist, flautist, or flute player. \"Flutist\" dates back to at least 1603, the earliest quotation cited by the \"Oxford English Dictionary\". \"Flautist\" was used in 1860 by Nathaniel Hawthorne in \"The Marble Faun\", after being adopted during the 18th century from Italy (\"flautista\", itself from \"flauto\"), like many musical terms in England since the Italian Renaissance. Other English terms, now virtually obsolete, are \"fluter\" (15th\u201319th centuries) and \"flutenist\" (17th and 18th centuries).\nHistory.\nA fragment of a juvenile cave bear's femur, with two to four holes, was found at Divje Babe in Slovenia and dated to about 43,000 years ago. It may be the oldest flute discovered, but this has been disputed. In 2008, a flute dated to at least 35,000 years ago was discovered in Hohle Fels cave near Ulm, Germany. It is a five-holed flute with a V-shaped mouthpiece and was made from a vulture wing bone. The discovery was published in the journal \"Nature\", in August 2009. This was the oldest confirmed musical instrument ever found, until a redating of flutes found in Gei\u00dfenkl\u00f6sterle cave revealed them to be older, at 42,000 to 43,000 years.\nThe Hohle Fels flute is one of several found in the Hohle Fels cavern next to the Venus of Hohle Fels and a short distance from the oldest known human carving. On announcing the discovery, scientists suggested that the \"finds demonstrate the presence of a well-established musical tradition at the time when modern humans colonized Europe\". Scientists have also suggested that this flute's discovery may help to explain \"the probable behavioural and cognitive gulf between\" Neanderthals and early modern human.\nAn 18.7\u00a0cm flute with three holes, made from a mammoth tusk and dated to 30,000\u201337,000 years ago, was found in 2004 in the Gei\u00dfenkl\u00f6sterle cave near Ulm, in the southern German Swabian Alb. Two flutes made from swan bones were excavated a decade earlier from the same cave and dated to about 36,000 years ago.\nA playable 9,000-year-old Chinese Gudi (literally, \"bone flute\") was excavated from a tomb in Jiahu along with 29 similar specimens. They were made from the wing bones of red-crowned cranes and each has five to eight holes.\nThe earliest extant Chinese transverse flute is a \"chi\" (\u7bea) flute discovered in the Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng at the Suizhou site, Hubei province, China, dating from 433 BC, during the later Zhou dynasty. It is fashioned of lacquered bamboo with closed ends and has five stops on the flute's side instead of the top. \"Shi Jing\", traditionally said to have been compiled and edited by Confucius, mentions chi flutes. \nThe earliest written reference to a flute is from a Sumerian-language cuneiform tablet dated to c. 2600\u20132700 BC.\nFlutes are mentioned in a recently translated tablet of the Epic of Gilgamesh, an epic poem whose development spanned the period from about 2100\u2013600 BC. A set of cuneiform tablets knows as the \"\"musical texts\" provide precise tuning instructions for seven scales of a stringed instrument (assumed to be a Babylonian lyre). One of those scales is named \"emb\u016bbum\"\", which is an Akkadian word for \"flute\".\nThe Bible, in Genesis 4:21, cites Jubal as being the \"father of all those who play the \"ugab\" and the \"kinnor\"\". The former Hebrew term is believed by some to refer to a wind instrument, or wind instruments in general, the latter to a stringed instrument, or stringed instruments in general. As such, Jubal is regarded in the Judeo-Christian tradition as the inventor of the flute (a word used in some translations of this biblical passage). In other sections of the Bible (1 Samuel 10:5, 1 Kings 1:40, Isaiah 5:12 and 30:29, and Jeremiah 48:36) the flute is referred to as \"chalil\", from the root word for \"hollow\". Archeological digs in the Holy Land have discovered flutes from the Bronze Age ( 4000\u20131200 BC) and the Iron Age (1200\u2013586 BC), the latter era \"witness[ing] the creation of the Israelite kingdom and its separation into the two kingdoms of Israel and Judea.\"\nSome early flutes were made out of tibias (shin bones). The flute has also always been an essential part of Indian culture, and the cross flute believed by several accounts to originate in India as Indian literature from 1500 BC has made vague references to the cross flute.\nAcoustics.\nA flute produces sound when a stream of air directed across a hole in the instrument creates a vibration of air at the hole. The airstream creates a Bernoulli or siphon. This excites the air contained in the resonant cavity (usually cylindrical) within the flute. The flutist changes the pitch of the sound produced by opening and closing holes in the body of the instrument, thus changing the effective length of the resonator and its corresponding resonant frequency. By varying the air pressure, a flutist can also change the pitch by causing the air in the flute to resonate at a harmonic rather than the fundamental frequency without opening or closing any of the holes.\nHead joint geometry appears particularly critical to acoustic performance and tone, but there is no clear consensus among manufacturers on a particular shape. Acoustic impedance of the embouchure hole appears the most critical parameter. Critical variables affecting this acoustic impedance include: the length of the chimney (the hole between the lip-plate and the head tube), chimney diameter, and radii or curvature of the ends of the chimney and any designed restriction in the \"throat\" of the instrument, such as that in the Japanese Nohkan flute.\nA study in which professional flutists were blindfolded could find no significant differences between flutes made from a variety of metals. In two different sets of blind listening, no flute was correctly identified in a first listening, and in a second, only the silver flute was identified. The study concluded that there was \"no evidence that the wall material has any appreciable effect on the sound color or dynamic range\".\nMaterials.\nHistorically, flutes were most commonly made of reed, bamboo, wood, or other organic materials. They were also made of glass, bone, and nephrite. Most modern flutes are made of metal, primarily silver and nickel. Silver is less common than silver alloys. Other materials used for flutes include gold, platinum, grenadilla and copper.\nTypes.\nIn its most basic form, a flute is an open tube which is blown into. After focused study and training, players use controlled air-direction to create an airstream in which the air is aimed downward into the tone hole of the flute's headjoint. There are several broad classes of flutes. With most flutes, the musician blows directly across the edge of the mouthpiece, with 1/4 of their bottom lip covering the embouchure hole. However, some flutes, such as the whistle, gemshorn, flageolet, recorder, tin whistle, tonette, fujara, and ocarina have a duct that directs the air onto the edge (an arrangement that is termed a \"fipple\"). These are known as fipple flutes. The fipple gives the instrument a distinct timbre which is different from non-fipple flutes and makes the instrument easier to play, but takes a degree of control away from the musician.\nAnother division is between side-blown (or transverse) flutes, such as the Western concert flute, piccolo, fife, dizi and bansuri; and end-blown flutes, such as the ney, xiao, kaval, danso, shakuhachi, Anasazi flute and quena. The player of a side-blown flute uses a hole on the side of the tube to produce a tone, instead of blowing on an end of the tube. End-blown flutes should not be confused with fipple flutes such as the recorder, which are also played vertically but have an internal duct to direct the air flow across the edge of the tone hole.\nFlutes may be open at one or both ends. The ocarina, xun, pan pipes, police whistle, and bosun's whistle are closed-ended. Open-ended flutes such as the concert flute and the recorder have more harmonics, and thus more flexibility for the player, and brighter timbres. An organ pipe may be either open or closed, depending on the sound desired.\nFlutes may have any number of pipes or tubes, though one is the most common number. Flutes with multiple resonators may be played one resonator at a time (as is typical with pan pipes) or more than one at a time (as is typical with double flutes).\nFlutes can be played with several different air sources. Conventional flutes are blown with the mouth, although some cultures use nose flutes. The flue pipes of organs, which are acoustically similar to duct flutes, are blown by bellows or fans.\nWestern transverse.\nWooden one-keyed.\nUsually in D, wooden transverse flutes were played in European classical music mainly in the period from the early 18th century to the early 19th century. As such, the instrument is often indicated as baroque flute. Gradually marginalized by the Western concert flute in the 19th century, baroque flutes were again played from the late 20th century as part of the historically informed performance practice.\nConcert.\nThe Western concert flute, a descendant of the medieval German flute, is a transverse treble flute that is closed at the top. An \"embouchure hole\" is positioned near the top, and the flutist blows across it. The flute has circular tone holes larger than the finger holes of its baroque predecessors. The size and placement of tone holes, key mechanism, and fingering system used to produce the notes in the flute's range were evolved from 1832 to 1847 by Theobald Boehm, who helped greatly improve the instrument's dynamic range and intonation over its predecessors. With some refinements (and the rare exception of the Kingma system and other custom adapted fingering systems), Western concert flutes typically conform to Boehm's design, known as the Boehm system. Beginner's flutes are made of nickel, silver, or brass that is silver-plated, while professionals use solid silver, gold, and sometimes even platinum flutes. There are also modern wooden-bodied flutes usually with silver or gold keywork. The wood is usually African Blackwood.\nThe standard concert flute is pitched in C and has a range of three octaves starting from middle C or one half step lower when a B foot is attached. This means that the concert flute is one of the highest-pitched common orchestra and concert band instruments.\nConcert variants.\nThe piccolo plays an octave higher than the regular treble flute. Lower members of the flute family include the G alto and C bass flutes that are used occasionally, and are pitched a perfect fourth and an octave below the concert flute, respectively. The contra-alto, contrabass, subcontrabass, double contrabass, and hyperbass flutes are other rare forms of the flute pitched up to four octaves below middle C.\nOther sizes of flutes and piccolos are used from time to time. A rarer instrument of the modern pitching system is the G treble flute. Instruments made according to an older pitch standard, used principally in wind-band music, include D piccolo, E soprano flute (Keyed a minor 3rd above the standard C flute), F alto flute, and B bass flute.\nIndian.\nThe bamboo flute is an important instrument in Indian classical music, and developed independently of the Western flute. The Hindu God Lord Krishna is traditionally considered a master of the bamboo flute. The Indian flutes are very simple compared to the Western counterparts; they are made of bamboo and are keyless.\nTwo main varieties of Indian flutes are currently used. The first, the Bansuri (\u092c\u093e\u0902\u0938\u0941\u0930\u0940), has six finger holes and one embouchure hole, and is used predominantly in the Hindustani music of Northern India. The second, the Venu or Pullanguzhal, has eight finger holes, and is played predominantly in the Carnatic music of Southern India. Presently, the eight-holed flute with cross-fingering technique is common among many Carnatic flutists. Prior to this, the South Indian flute had only seven finger holes, with the fingering standard developed by Sharaba Shastri, of the Palladam school, at the beginning of the 20th century.\nThe quality of the flute's sound depends somewhat on the specific bamboo used to make it, and it is generally agreed that the best bamboo grows in the Nagercoil area of South India.\nIn 1998 Bharata Natya Shastra Sarana Chatushtai, Avinash Balkrishna Patwardhan developed a methodology to produce perfectly tuned flutes for the ten 'thatas' currently present in Indian Classical Music.\nIn a regional dialect of Gujarati, a flute is also called Pavo. Some people can also play pair of flutes (Jodiyo Pavo) simultaneously.\nChinese.\nIn China there are many varieties of dizi (\u7b1b\u5b50), or Chinese flute, with different sizes, structures (with or without a resonance membrane) and number of holes (from 6 to 11) and intonations (different keys). Most are made of bamboo, but can come in wood, jade, bone, and iron. One peculiar feature of the Chinese flute is the use of a resonance membrane mounted on one of the holes that vibrates with the air column inside the tube. This membrane is called a \"di mo\", which is usually a thin tissue paper. It gives the flute a bright sound.\nCommonly seen flutes in the modern Chinese orchestra are the bangdi (\u6886\u7b1b), qudi (\u66f2\u7b1b), xindi (\u65b0\u7b1b), and dadi (\u5927\u7b1b). The bamboo flute played vertically is called the xiao (\u7c2b), which is a different category of wind instrument in China.\nKorean.\nThe Korean flute, called the daegeum, \ub300\uae08, is a large bamboo transverse flute used in traditional Korean music. It has a buzzing membrane that gives it a unique timbre.\nJapanese.\nThe Japanese flute, called the fue, (hiragana: ), encompasses a large number of musical flutes from Japan, include the end-blown shakuhachi and hotchiku, as well as the transverse gakubue, komabue, ry\u016bteki, n\u014dkan, shinobue, kagurabue and minteki.\nSodina and suling.\nThe sodina is an end-blown flute found throughout the island state of Madagascar, located in the Indian Ocean off southeastern Africa. One of the oldest instruments on the island, it bears close resemblance to end-blown flutes found in Southeast Asia and particularly Indonesia, where it is known as the \"suling\", suggesting the predecessor to the sodina was carried to Madagascar in outrigger canoes by the island's original settlers emigrating from Borneo. An image of the most celebrated contemporary sodina flutist, Rakoto Frah (d. 2001), was featured on the local currency.\nSring.\nThe sring (also called \"blul\") is a relatively small, end-blown flute with a nasal tone quality found in the Caucasus region of Eastern Armenia. It is made of wood or cane, usually with seven finger holes and one thumb hole, producing a diatonic scale. One Armenian musicologist believes the sring to be the most characteristic of national Armenian instruments.\n\u1eccj\u00e0.\nThe \u1eccj\u00e0 is a traditional musical instrument utilized by the Igbo people, who are indigenous to Nigeria. The \u1ecdj\u00e0 (flute) is used during cultural activities or events where Igbo music is played. It is skillfully carved from wood/bamboo or metal and is played by blowing air into one end while covering and uncovering holes along the body to create different notes.\nBreathing techniques.\nThere are several means by which flautists breathe to blow air through the instrument and produce sound. They include diaphragmatic breathing and circular breathing. Diaphragmatic breathing optimizes inhalation, minimizing the number of breaths. Circular breathing brings air in through the nose and out through the mouth, enabling a continuous sound."}

Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport.\nThe game of association football is played in accordance with the Laws of the Game, a set of rules that has been in effect since 1863 and maintained by the IFAB since 1886. The game is played with a football that is in circumference. The two teams compete to score goals by getting the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts, under the bar, and fully across the goal line). When the ball is in play, the players mainly use their feet, but may also use any other part of their body, such as their head, chest, and thighs, except for their hands or arms, to control, strike, or pass the ball. Only the goalkeepers may use their hands and arms, and that only within the penalty area. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner. There are situations where a goal can be disallowed, such as an offside call or a foul in the build-up to the goal. Depending on the format of the competition, an equal number of goals scored may result in a draw being declared with 1 point awarded to each team, or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shoot-out.\nInternationally, association football is governed by FIFA. Under FIFA, there are six continental confederations: AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, OFC, and UEFA. Of these confederations, CONMEBOL is the oldest one, being founded in 1916. National associations (e.g. The FA in England) are responsible for managing the game in their own countries both professionally and at an amateur level, and coordinating competitions in accordance with the Laws of the Game. \nThe most prestigious senior international competition is the FIFA World Cup. The men's World Cup is the most-viewed sporting event in the world, surpassing the Olympic Games. The two most prestigious competitions in club football are the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Women's Champions League, which attract an extensive television audience worldwide. The final of the men's tournament is the most-watched annual sporting event in the world.\nName.\nAssociation football is one of a family of football codes that emerged from various ball games played worldwide since antiquity. Within the English-speaking world, the sport is now usually called \"football\" in Great Britain and most of Ulster in the north of Ireland, whereas people usually call it \"soccer\" in regions and countries where other codes of football are prevalent, such as Australia, Canada, South Africa, most of Ireland (excluding Ulster), and the United States. A notable exception is New Zealand, where in the first two decades of the 21st century, under the influence of international television, \"football\" has been gaining prevalence, despite the dominance of other codes of football, namely rugby union and rugby league.\nThe term \"soccer\" comes from Oxford \"-er\" slang, which was prevalent at the University of Oxford in England from about 1875, and is thought to have been borrowed from the slang of Rugby School. Initially spelt \"assoccer\" (a shortening of \"association\"), it was later reduced to the modern spelling. This form of slang also gave rise to \"rugger\" for rugby football, \"fiver\" and \"tenner\" for five pound and ten pound notes, and the now-archaic \"footer\" that was also a name for association football. The word \"soccer\" arrived at its current form in 1895 and was first recorded in 1889 in the earlier form of \"socca\".\nHistory.\nKicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple cultures. The Chinese competitive game \"\" (, literally \"kickball\"; also known as \"tsu chu\") resembles modern association football as well as a mix of basketball, and volleyball.\n This is the earliest form of a kicking game for which there is historical evidence. The game was first recorded as in exercise in the Zhan Guo Ce, a military history from the Han dynasty. ' players would pass the ball around, having to avoid it touching the ground at any point. It was then passed to a designated player, who attempted to kick it through the \"fengliu yan\", a circular goal atop 10\u201311 meter poles. During the Han dynasty (206 BCE \u2013 220 CE), ' games were standardised and rules were established. The Silk Road facilitated the transmission of \"cuju\" outside of China, especially the form of the game popular in the Tang dynasty, the period when the inflatable ball was invented and replaced the stuffed ball. Other East Asian games include ' in Japan and ' in Korea, both influenced by \"cuju\". \"\" originated after the year 600 during the Asuka period. It was a ceremonial rather than a competitive game, and involved the kicking of a \"mari\", a ball made of animal skin. In North America, was a ball game played by the Algonquians; it was described as \"almost identical to the kind of folk football being played in Europe at the same time, in which the ball was kicked through goals\".\n' and ' were Greek ball games. An image of an ' player depicted in low relief on a stele of in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens appears on the UEFA European Championship trophy. Athenaeus, writing in 228 CE, mentions the Roman ball game '. ' and ' were played involving hands and violence. They all appear to have resembled rugby football, wrestling, and volleyball more than what is recognisable as modern football. As with pre-codified mob football, the antecedent of all modern football codes, these three games involved more handling the ball than kicking it.\nAssociation football in itself does not have a classical history. Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world, FIFA has described that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe. The history of football in England dates back to at least the eighth century. The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of England.\nThe Cambridge rules, first drawn up at the University of Cambridge in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football. The Cambridge rules were written at Trinity College, Cambridge, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club, formed by former public school pupils in 1857, which led to the formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867. In 1862, John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules.\nThese ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of The Football Association (The FA) in 1863, which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the Freemasons' Tavern in Great Queen Street, London. The only school to be represented on this occasion was Charterhouse. The Freemasons' Tavern was the setting for five more meetings of The FA between October and December 1863; the English FA eventually issued the first comprehensive set of rules named , forming modern football. The laws included bans on running with the ball in hand and hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Eleven clubs, under the charge of FA secretary Ebenezer Cobb Morley, ratified the original thirteen laws of the game. The sticking point was hacking, which a twelfth club at the meeting, Blackheath FC, had wanted to keep, resulting in them withdrawing from the FA. Other English rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA, and instead in 1871, along with Blackheath, formed the Rugby Football Union. The FA rules included handling of the ball by \"marks\" and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to Victorian rules football being developed at that time in Australia. The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s, with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games.\nThe world's oldest football competition is the FA Cup, which was founded by the footballer and cricketer Charles W. Alcock, and has been contested by English teams since 1872. The first official international football match also took place in 1872, between Scotland and England in Glasgow, again at the instigation of Alcock. England is also home to the world's first football league, which was founded in Birmingham in 1888 by Aston Villa director William McGregor. The original format contained 12 clubs from the Midlands and Northern England.\nLaws of the Game are determined by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). The board was formed in 1886 after a meeting in Manchester of the Football Association, the Scottish Football Association, the Football Association of Wales, and the Irish Football Association. FIFA, the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to the Laws of the Game of the Football Association. The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the IFAB in 1913. The board consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations.\nFor most of the 20th century, Europe and South America were the dominant regions in association football. The FIFA World Cup, inaugurated in 1930, became the main stage for players of both continents to show their worth and the strength of their national teams. In the second half of the century, the European Cup and the Copa Libertadores were created, and the champions of these two club competitions would contest the Intercontinental Cup to prove which team was the best in the world.\nIn the 21st century, South America has continued to produce some of the best footballers in the world, but its clubs have fallen behind the still dominant European clubs, which often sign the best players from Latin America and elsewhere. Meanwhile, football has improved in Africa, Asia and North America, and nowadays, these regions are at least on equal grounds with South America in club football, although countries in the Caribbean and Oceania regions (except Australia) have yet to make a mark in international football. When it comes to men's national teams, Europeans and South Americans continue to dominate the FIFA World Cup, as no team from any other region has managed to even reach the final. These regional trends do not hold true for the women's game, as the United States women's national team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup four times, more than any other women's team.\nFootball is played at a professional level all over the world. Millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favourite teams, while billions more watch the game on television or on the internet. A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level. According to a survey conducted by FIFA published in 2001, over 240 million people from more than 200 countries regularly play football. Football has the highest global television audience in sport.\nIn many parts of the world, football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans, local communities, and even nations. Ryszard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski says that Europeans who are polite, modest, or humble fall easily into rage when playing or watching football games. The Ivory Coast national football team helped secure a truce to the nation's civil war in 2006 and it helped further reduce tensions between government and rebel forces in 2007 by playing a match in the rebel capital of Bouak\u00e9, an occasion that brought both armies together peacefully for the first time. By contrast, football is widely considered to have been the final proximate cause for the Football War in June 1969 between El Salvador and Honduras. The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the Croatian War of Independence of the 1990s, when a match between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade degenerated into rioting in May 1990.\nWomen's association football.\nWomen's association football has historically seen opposition, with national associations severely curbing its development and several outlawing it completely. Women may have been playing football for as long as the game has existed. Evidence shows that a similar ancient game (\"cuju\", or \"tsu chu\") was played by women during the Han dynasty (25\u2013220 CE), as female figures are depicted in frescoes of the period playing \"tsu chu\". There are also reports of annual football matches played by women in Midlothian, Scotland, during the 1790s.\nAssociation football, the modern game, has documented early involvement of women. In 1863, football governing bodies introduced standardised rules to prohibit violence on the pitch, making it more socially acceptable for women to play. The first match recorded by the Scottish Football Association took place in 1892 in Glasgow. In England, the first recorded game of football between women took place in 1895. Women's football has traditionally been associated with charity games and physical exercise, particularly in the United Kingdom.\nAssociation football continued to be played by women since the time of the first recorded women's games in the late 19th century. The best-documented early European team was founded by activist Nettie Honeyball in England in 1894. It was named the British Ladies' Football Club. Honeyball is quoted as, \"I founded the association late last year [1894], with the fixed resolve of proving to the world that women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured. I must confess, my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of emancipation, and I look forward to the time when ladies may sit in Parliament and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most.\" Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football. However, the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations and continued without their support. It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the \"masculinity\" of the game.\nWomen's football became popular on a large scale at the time of the First World War, when female employment in heavy industry spurred the growth of the game, much as it had done for men 50 years earlier. The most successful team of the era was Dick, Kerr Ladies F.C. of Preston, England. The team played in one of the first women's international matches against a French XI team in 1920, and also made up most of the England team against a Scottish Ladies XI in the same year, winning 22\u20130.\nDespite being more popular than some men's football events, with one match seeing a 53,000 strong crowd in 1920, women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on association members' pitches, stating that \"the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and should not be encouraged.\" Players and football writers have argued that this ban was, in fact, due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted, and because the FA had no control over the money made from the women's game. The FA ban led to the formation of the short-lived English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds. Women's football also faced bans in several other countries, notably in Brazil from 1941 to 1979, in France from 1941 to 1970, and in Germany from 1955 to 1970.\nRestrictions began to be reduced in the 1960s and 1970s. The Italian women's football league was established in 1968. In December 1969, the Women's Football Association was formed in England, with the sport eventually becoming the most prominent team sport for women in the United Kingdom. Two unofficial women's World Cups were organised by the FIEFF in 1970 and in 1971. Also in 1971, UEFA members voted to officially recognise women's football, while The Football Association rescinded the ban that prohibited women from playing on association members' pitches in England.\nWomen's football still faces many struggles, but its worldwide growth has seen major competitions being launched at both the national and international levels, mirroring the men's competitions. The FIFA Women's World Cup was inaugurated in 1991: the first tournament was held in China, featuring 12 teams from the respective six confederations. The World Cup has been held every four years since; by 2019, it had expanded to 24 national teams, and 1.12 billion viewers watched the competition. Four years later, FIFA targeted the 32-team 2023 Women's World Cup at an audience of 2 billion, while about 1.4 million tickets were sold, setting a Women's World Cup record. Women's football has been an Olympic event since 1996.\nNorth America is the dominant region in women's football, with the United States winning the most FIFA Women's World Cups and Olympic tournaments. Europe and Asia come second and third in terms of international success, and the women's game has been improving in South America.\nGameplay.\nAssociation football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the . The game is played using a spherical ball of circumference, known as the \"football\" (or \"soccer ball\"). Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent their team in the coin toss before kick-off or penalty kicks.\nThe primary law is that players other than goalkeepers may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play, though they must use both their hands during a throw-in restart. Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around, they may use any part of their body (notably, \"heading\" with the forehead) other than their hands or arms. Within normal play, all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch, though players may not pass to teammates who are in an offside position.\nDuring gameplay, players attempt to create goal-scoring opportunities through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.\nAt a professional level, most matches produce only a few goals. For example, the 2022\u201323 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.85 goals per match. The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper, but a number of specialised roles have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: strikers, or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper.\nThese positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends the most time. For example, there are central defenders and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time. The layout of a team's players is known as a \"formation\". Defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager.\nLaws.\nThere are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulations and guidelines. The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football for both sexes, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors and people with physical disabilities are permitted. The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the IFAB. In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of association football. Within the United States, Major League Soccer used a distinct ruleset during the 1990s and the National Federation of State High School Associations and NCAA still use rulesets that are comparable to, but different from, the IFAB Laws.\nPlayers, equipment, and officials.\nEach team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal. Though there are a variety of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.\nThe basic equipment or \"kit\" players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate shin guards. An athletic supporter and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals. Headgear is not a required piece of basic equipment, but players today may choose to wear it to protect themselves from head injury. Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches. The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.\nA number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is five in 90 minutes, with each team being allowed one more if the game should go into extra-time; the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in friendly matches. Common reasons for a substitution include injury, tiredness, ineffectiveness, a tactical switch, or timewasting at the end of a finely poised game. In standard adult matches, a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match. IFAB recommends \"that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team\". Any decision regarding points awarded for abandoned games is left to the individual football associations.\nA game is officiated by a referee, who has \"full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed\" (Law 5), and whose decisions are final. The referee is assisted by two assistant referees. In many high-level games there is also a fourth official who assists the referee and may replace another official should the need arise.\nGoal line technology is used to measure if the whole ball has crossed the goal-line thereby determining whether a goal has been scored or not; this was brought in to prevent controversy. Video assistant referees (VAR) have also been increasingly introduced in high-level matches to assist officials through video replays to correct clear and obvious mistakes. There are four types of calls that can be reviewed: mistaken identity in awarding a red or yellow card, goals and whether there was a violation during the buildup, direct red card decisions, and penalty decisions.\nBall.\nThe ball is spherical with a circumference of between , a weight in the range of , and a pressure between at sea level. In the past the ball was made up of leather panels sewn together, with a latex bladder for pressurisation, but modern balls at all levels of the game are now synthetic.\nPitch.\nAs the Laws were formulated in England, and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within IFAB, the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though use of imperial units remains popular in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of metrication (or only partial metrication), such as Britain.\nThe length of the pitch, or field, for international adult matches is in the range of and the width is in the range of . Fields for non-international matches may be in length and in width, provided the pitch does not become square. In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of long and wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches; however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.\nThe longer boundary lines are \"touchlines\", while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are \"goal lines\". A rectangular goal is positioned on each goal line, midway between the two touchlines. The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be above the ground. Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws.\nIn front of the goal is the penalty area. This area is marked by the goal line, two lines starting on the goal line from the goalposts and extending into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick-offs, goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.\nDuration and tie-breaking methods.\n90-minute ordinary time.\nA standard adult football match consists of two halves of 45 minutes each. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called \"additional time\" in FIFA documents, but is most commonly referred to as \"stoppage time\" or \"injury time\", while \"lost time\" can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. Stoppage time does not fully compensate for the time in which the ball is out of play, and a 90-minute game typically involves about an hour of \"effective playing time\". The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, towards the end of the half, the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time they intend to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee. Added time was introduced because of an incident in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1\u20130 with two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty kick. Villa's goalkeeper deliberately kicked the ball far out of play; by the time it was recovered, the clock had run out and the game was over, leaving Stoke unable to attempt the penalty. The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until a penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed; thus, no game can end with an uncompleted penalty.\nTie-breaking.\nIn league competitions, games may end in a draw. In knockout competitions where a winner is required, various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock; some competitions may invoke replays. A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of penalty shoot-outs (known officially in the Laws of the Game as \"kicks from the penalty mark\") to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament or be the champion. Goals scored during extra time periods count towards the final score of the game, but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament, with goals scored in a penalty shoot-out not making up part of the final score.\nIn competitions using two-legged matches, each team competes at home once, with an aggregate score from the two matches deciding which team progresses. Where aggregates are equal, the away goals rule may be used to determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home. If the result is still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shoot-out are required.\nBall in and out of play.\nUnder the Laws, the two basic states of play during a game are \"ball in play\" and \"ball out of play\". From the beginning of each playing period with a kick-off until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of eight restart methods depending on how it went out of play:\nMisconduct.\nOn-field.\nA foul occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the Laws of the Game while the ball is in play. The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12. Handling the ball deliberately, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent, are examples of \"penal fouls\", punishable by a direct free kick or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred. Other fouls are punishable by an indirect free kick.\nThe referee may punish a player's or substitute's misconduct by a caution (yellow card) or dismissal (red card). A second yellow card in the same game leads to a red card, which results in a dismissal. A player given a yellow card is said to have been \"booked\", the referee writing the player's name in their official notebook. If a player has been dismissed, no substitute can be brought on in their place and the player may not participate in further play. Misconduct may occur at any time, and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad. In particular, the offence of \"unsporting behaviour\" may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences. A referee can show a yellow or red card to a player, substitute, substituted player, and to non-players such as managers and support staff.\nRather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as \"playing an advantage\". The referee may \"call back\" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within \"a few seconds\". Even if an offence is not penalised due to advantage being played, the offender may still be sanctioned for misconduct at the next stoppage of play.\nThe referee's decision in all on-pitch matters is considered final. The score of a match cannot be altered after the game, even if later evidence shows that decisions (including awards/non-awards of goals) were incorrect.\nOff-field.\nAlong with the general administration of the sport, football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as comments to the press, clubs' financial management, doping, age fraud and match fixing. Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game. Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card. Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.\nSanctions for such infractions may be levied on individuals or on clubs as a whole. Penalties may include fines, point deductions (in league competitions) or even expulsion from competitions. For example, the English Football League deduct 12 points from any team that enters financial administration. Among other administrative sanctions are penalties against game forfeiture. Teams that had forfeited a game or had been forfeited against would be awarded a technical loss or win.\nGoverning bodies.\nThe recognised international governing body of football (and associated games, such as futsal and beach soccer) is FIFA. The FIFA headquarters are located in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. Six regional confederations are associated with FIFA; these are:\nNational associations (or national federations) oversee football within individual countries. These are generally synonymous with sovereign states (for example, the Cameroonian Football Federation in Cameroon), but also include a smaller number of associations responsible for sub-national entities or autonomous regions (for example, the Scottish Football Association in Scotland). 211 national associations are affiliated both with FIFA and with their respective continental confederations. Other national associations may be members of continental confederations but otherwise not participate in FIFA competitions.\nWhile FIFA is responsible for arranging competitions and most rules related to international competition, the actual Laws of the Game are set by the IFAB, where each of the UK Associations has one vote, while FIFA collectively has four votes.\nInternational competitions.\nInternational competitions in association football principally consist of two varieties: competitions involving representative national teams or those involving clubs based in multiple nations and national leagues. \"International football\", without qualification, most often refers to the former. In the case of international club competition, it is the country of origin of the clubs involved, not the nationalities of their players, that renders the competition international in nature.\nThe major international competition in football and the most prestigious is the World Cup, organised by FIFA. This competition has taken place every four years since 1930, with the exception of the 1942 and 1946 tournaments, which were cancelled because of World War II. As of 2022, over 200 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals. The finals tournament involved 32 national teams (expanding to 48 teams for the 2026 tournament) competing over a four-week period. The World Cup is the world's most widely viewed and most followed sporting event, with the 2022 tournament estimated to be watched by 5 billion people, more than 60% of the global population. The 1958 World Cup saw the emergence of Pel\u00e9 as a global sporting star, a period that coincided with \"the explosive spread of television, which massively amplified his presence everywhere\". The current champions are Argentina, who won their third title at the 2022 tournament in Qatar. The FIFA Women's World Cup has been held every four years since 1991. Under the tournament's current format that was expanded in 2023, national teams vie for 31 slots in a three-year qualification phase, while the host nation's team enters automatically as the 32nd slot. The current champions are Spain, after winning their first title in the 2023 tournament.\nThere has been a football tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900, except at the 1932 games in Los Angeles when FIFA and the International Olympic Committee had disagreed over the status of amateur players. Before the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) were the most prestigious international event. Originally, the tournament was for amateurs only. As professionalism spread around the world, the gap in quality between the World Cup and the Olympics widened. The countries that benefited most were the Soviet Bloc countries of Eastern Europe, where top athletes were state-sponsored while retaining their status as amateurs. Between 1948 and 1980, 23 out of 27 Olympic medals were won by Eastern Europe, with only Sweden (gold in 1948 and bronze in 1952), Denmark (bronze in 1948 and silver in 1960) and Japan (bronze in 1968) breaking their dominance. For the 1984 Los Angeles Games, the IOC allowed professional players to compete. Since 1992, male competitors must be under 23 years old, although since 1996, three players over the age of 23 have been allowed per squad. A women's tournament was added in 1996; in contrast to the men's event, full international sides without age restrictions play the women's Olympic tournament.\nAfter the World Cup, the most important international football competitions are the continental championships, which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams. These are the European Championship (UEFA), the Copa Am\u00e9rica (CONMEBOL), the Africa Cup of Nations (CAF), the Asian Cup (AFC), the Gold Cup (CONCACAF) and the Nations Cup (OFC). These competitions are not strictly limited to members of the continental confederations, with guest teams from other continents sometimes invited to compete. The FIFA Confederations Cup was contested by the winners of all six continental championships, the current FIFA World Cup champions, and the country which was hosting the next World Cup. This was generally regarded as a warm-up tournament for the upcoming FIFA World Cup and did not carry the same prestige as the World Cup itself. The tournament was discontinued following the 2017 edition with its calendar slot replaced by an expanded FIFA Club World Cup. The UEFA Nations League and the CONCACAF Nations League were introduced in the late 2010s to replace international friendlies during the two-year cycle between major tournaments.\nThe most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective continental championships, which are generally contested between national champions, for example, the UEFA Champions League in Europe and the Copa Libertadores in South America. The winners of each continental competition contest the FIFA Intercontinental Cup, held annually, and the FIFA Club World Cup, held once every four years.\nDomestic competitions.\nThe governing bodies in each country operate league systems in a domestic season, normally comprising several divisions, in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results. Teams are placed into tables, placing them in order according to points accrued. Most commonly, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a round-robin tournament. At the end of a season, the top team is declared the champion. The top few teams may be promoted to a higher division, and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are relegated to a lower division.\nThe teams finishing at the top of a country's league may also be eligible to play in international club competitions in the following season. The main exceptions to this system occur in some Latin American leagues, which divide football championships into two sections named Apertura and Clausura (Spanish for \"Opening\" and \"Closing\"), awarding a champion for each. Most countries supplement the league system with one or more \"cup\" competitions organised on a knock-out basis. These include the domestic cup, which may be open to all eligible teams in a country's league system\u2014both professional and amateur\u2014and is organised by the national federation.\nSome countries' top divisions feature highly-paid star players; in smaller countries, lower divisions, and many women's clubs, players may be part-timers with a second job, or amateurs. The five top European leagues \u2013 Premier League (England), Bundesliga (Germany), La Liga (Spain), Serie A (Italy), and Ligue 1 (France) \u2013 attract most of the world's best players and, during the 2006\u201307 season, each of these leagues had a total wage cost in excess of \u20ac600 million. These leagues also generated a combined \u20ac17.2\u00a0billion in revenue in the 2021\u201322 season from television contracts, matchday tickets, sponsorships, and other sources.\nVariants and casual play.\nVariants of football have been codified for reduced-sized teams (i.e. five-a-side football) play in non-field environments (i.e. beach soccer, indoor soccer, and futsal) and for teams with disabilities (i.e. paralympic association football).\nStreet football can be played with only minimal equipment \u2013 a basic game can be played on almost any open area of reasonable size with just a ball and items to mark the positions of two sets of goalposts. Such games can have team sizes that vary from eleven-a-side, can use a limited or modified subset of the official rules, and can be self-officiated by the players."}

It was the corporate successor to his earlier Greater New York Film Rental Company and Box Office Attraction Company (founded 1913).\nThe company's first film studios were set up in Fort Lee, New Jersey, but in 1917, William Fox sent Sol M. Wurtzel to Hollywood, California to oversee the studio's new West Coast production facilities, where the climate was more hospitable for filmmaking. On July 23, 1926, Fox Studios bought the patents of the Movietone sound system for recording sound onto film.\nAfter the Wall Street Crash of 1929, William Fox lost control of the company in 1930, during a hostile takeover. Under new president Sidney R. Kent, the new owners merged the company with Twentieth Century Pictures to form 20th Century-Fox in 1935.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nWilliam Fox entered the film industry in 1904 when he purchased a one-third share of a Brooklyn nickelodeon for $1,667. He reinvested his profits from that initial location, expanding to fifteen similar venues in the city, and purchasing prints from the major studios of the time: Biograph, Essanay, Kalem, Lubin, Path\u00e9, Selig, and Vitagraph. After experiencing further success presenting live vaudeville routines along with motion pictures, he expanded into larger venues beginning with his purchase of the disused Gaiety theater, and continuing with acquisitions throughout New York City and New Jersey, including the Academy of Music.\nFox invested further in the film industry by founding the Greater New York Film Rental Company as a film distributor. The major film studios responded by forming the Motion Picture Patents Company in 1908 and the General Film Company in 1910, in an effort to create a monopoly on the creation and distribution of motion pictures. Fox refused to sell out to the monopoly, and sued under the Sherman Antitrust Act, eventually receiving a $370,000 settlement, and ending restrictions on the length of films and the prices that could be paid for screenplays.\nIn 1914, reflecting the broader scope of his business, he renamed it the Box Office Attraction Company He entered into a contract with the Balboa Amusement Producing Company film studio, purchasing all of their films for showing in his New York area theaters and renting the prints to other exhibitors nationwide. He also continued to distribute material from other sources, such as Winsor McCay's early animated film \"Gertie the Dinosaur\". Later that year, Fox concluded that it was unwise to be so dependent on other companies, so he purchased the \u00c9clair studio facilities in Fort Lee, New Jersey, along with property in Staten Island, and arranged for actors and crew. The company became a film studio, using the name Box Office Attraction Company; its first release was \"Life's Shop Window\".\nFox Film Corporation.\nAlways more of an entrepreneur than a showman, Fox concentrated on acquiring and building theaters; pictures were secondary. The company's first film studios were set up in Fort Lee where it and many other early film studios in America's first motion picture industry were based at the beginning of the 20th century.\nThat same year, in 1914, Fox Film began making motion pictures in California, and in 1915 decided to build its own permanent studio. The company leased the Los Angeles Edendale studio of the Selig Polyscope Company until its own studio, located at Western Avenue and Sunset Boulevard, was completed in 1916. In 1917, William Fox sent Sol M. Wurtzel to Hollywood to oversee the studio's West Coast production facilities where a more hospitable and cost-effective climate existed for filmmaking. Between 1915 and 1919, Fox Films earned millions of dollars through films featuring Theda Bara, known as \"The Vamp\" due to her unique ability to display exoticism.\nWith the introduction of sound technology, Fox moved to acquire the rights to a sound-on-film process. In the years 1925\u201326, Fox purchased the rights to the work of Freeman Harrison Owens, the U.S. rights to the Tri-Ergon system invented by three German inventors, and the work of Theodore Case. This resulted in the Movietone sound system later known as \"Fox Movietone\" developed at the Movietone Studio. Later that year, the company began offering films with a music-and-effects track, and the following year Fox began the weekly \"Fox Movietone News\" feature, that ran until 1963. The growing company needed space, and in 1926 Fox acquired 300\u00a0acres\u00a0(1.2\u00a0km2) in the open country west of Beverly Hills and built \"Movietone City\", the best-equipped studio of its time.\nBecause William Fox opted to remain in New York, much of the Hollywood filmmaking at the Fox Film Corporation was instead managed by Fox's movie makers. Janet Gaynor would also become one of the company's most prominent stars by the late 1920s.\nDecline.\nWhen rival Marcus Loew died in 1927, Fox offered to buy the Loew family's holdings. Loew's Inc. controlled more than 200 theaters, as well as the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio. The Loew family agreed to the sale, and the merger of Fox and Loew's Inc. was announced in 1929; MGM studio bosses Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg were not included in the deal, and fought back. Using powerful political connections, Mayer called upon the Justice Department's antitrust unit to delay giving final approval to the merger. William Fox was badly injured in a car crash in the summer of 1929, and by the time he recovered, he had lost most of his fortune in the stock market crash of 1929, ending any chance of the Fox/Loew's merger being approved, even without the Justice Department's objections.\nOverextended and close to bankruptcy, Fox was stripped of his empire in 1930 and later ended up in jail on bribery and perjury charges. Fox Film, with more than 500 theatres, was placed in receivership. A bank-mandated reorganization propped the company up for a time, but it soon became apparent that despite its size, Fox could not stand on its own. William Fox resented the way he was forced out of his company and portrayed it as an active conspiracy against him in the 1933 book \"Upton Sinclair Presents William Fox\".\nMerger.\nUnder new president Sidney Kent, the new owners began negotiating with the upstart, but powerful independent Twentieth Century Pictures in the early spring of 1935. Twentieth Century had begun in the Samuel Goldwyn Studios in 1932 under founders Joseph Schenck and Darryl F. Zanuck. \nThe two companies merged that spring of 1935 and became 20th Century-Fox. The company was purchased by News Corporation in 1985, becoming \"20th Century Fox\" without the hyphen, and in 2020 was purchased by The Walt Disney Company and renamed 20th Century Studios. For many years, 20th Century-Fox claimed to have been founded in 1915; for instance, it marked 1945 as its 30th anniversary. However, in recent years it has claimed the 1935 merger as its founding, marking its 75th rather than 95th anniversary in 2010.\nProducts.\nFeature films.\nA 1937 fire in a Fox film storage facility destroyed over 40,000 reels of negatives and prints, including the best-quality copies of every Fox feature produced prior to 1932; although copies located elsewhere allowed many to survive in some form, over 75% of Fox's feature films from before 1930 are completely lost.\nNewsreels.\nIn 1919, Fox began a series of silent newsreels, competing with existing series such as \"Hearst Metrotone News\", \"International Newsreel\", and \"Path\u00e9 News\". \"Fox News\" premiered on October 11, 1919, with subsequent issues released on the Wednesday and Sunday of each week. \"Fox News\" gained an advantage over its more established competitors when President Woodrow Wilson endorsed the newsreel in a letter, in what may have been the first time an American president commented on a film. In subsequent years, \"Fox News\" remained one of the major names in the newsreel industry by providing often-exclusive coverage of major international events, including reporting on Pancho Villa, the airship \"Roma\", the Ku Klux Klan, and a 1922 eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The silent newsreel series continued until 1930.\nIn 1926, a subsidiary, Fox Movietone Corporation, was created, tasked with producing newsreels using Fox's recently acquired sound-on-film technology. The first of these newsreels debuted on January 21, 1927. Four months later, the May 25 release of a sound recording of Charles Lindbergh's departure on his transatlantic flight was described by film historian Raymond Fielding as the \"first sound news film of consequence\". \"Movietone News\" was launched as a regular newsreel feature December 3 of that year. Production of the series continued after the merger with Twentieth Century Pictures, until 1963, and continued to serve 20th Century Fox after that, as a source for film industry stock footage.\nUnlike Fox's early feature films, the \"Fox News\" and \"Fox Movietone News\" libraries have largely survived. The earlier series and some parts of its sound successor are now held by the University of South Carolina, with the remaining \"Fox Movietone News\" still held by the company.\nSerials.\nFox Film briefly experimented with serial films, releasing the 15-episode \"Bride 13\" and the 20-episode \"Fant\u00f4mas\" in 1920. William Fox was unwilling to compromise on production quality in order to make serials profitable, however, and none were produced subsequently.\nShort films.\nHundreds of one- and two-reel short films of various types were also produced by Fox. Beginning in 1916, the Sunshine Comedy division created two-reel comedy shorts. Many of these, beginning with 1917's \"Roaring Lions and Wedding Bliss\", starring Lloyd Hamilton, were slapstick, intended to compete with Mack Sennett's popular offerings. Sunshine releases continued until the introduction of sound. Other short film series included \"Imperial Comedies\", \"Van Bibber Comedies\" (with Earle Foxe), \"O'Henry\", \"Married Life of Helen and Warren\", and \"Fox Varieties\". Fox's expansion into Spanish-language films in the early 1930s also included shorts."}
{"id": "10574", "revid": "29750937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10574", "title": "First National Pictures", "text": "First National Pictures was an American motion picture production and distribution company. It was founded in 1917 as First National Exhibitors' Circuit, Inc., an association of independent theatre owners in the United States, and became the country's largest theater chain. Expanding from exhibiting movies to distributing them, the company reincorporated in 1919 as \"Associated First National Theatres, Inc.\" and \"Associated First National Pictures, Inc.\" In 1924 it expanded to become a motion picture production company as \"First National Pictures, Inc.\", and became an important studio in the film industry. In September 1928, control of First National passed to Warner Bros., into which it was completely absorbed on November 4, 1929. A number of Warner Bros. films were thereafter branded First National Pictures until July 1936, when First National Pictures, Inc., was dissolved.\nEarly history.\nThe First National Exhibitors' Circuit was founded in 1917 by the merger of 26 of the biggest first-run cinema chains in the United States. It eventually controlled over 600 cinemas, more than 200 of them first-run houses (as opposed to the less lucrative second-run or neighbourhood theatres to which films moved when their initial box office receipts dwindled).\nFirst National was the brainchild of Thomas L. Tally, who was reacting to the overwhelming influence of Paramount Pictures, which dominated the market. In 1912, he thought that a conglomerate of theatres throughout the nation could buy or produce and distribute its own films. In 1917 Tally and J. D. Williams formed First National Exhibitors' Circuit.\nThe first film released through First National was the 1916 British film \"The Mother of Dartmoor\". Between 1917 and 1918, the company made contracts with Mary Pickford and Charlie Chaplin, the first million-dollar deals in the history of film.\nChaplin's contract allowed him to produce his films without a set release schedule. However, the production of the feature film \"The Kid\" ran so long that the company started to complain.\nTo address their concerns, Chaplin invited the exhibitors to the studio, and they were so impressed by the project and charmed by the players, especially co-star Jackie Coogan, that they agreed to be patient. That patience was ultimately rewarded when \"The Kid\" became a major critical and box office success.\nFirst National's distribution of films by independent producers is credited with launching careers including that of Louis B. Mayer.\nFirst National Exhibitors' Circuit was reincorporated in 1919 as Associated First National Pictures, Inc., and its subsidiary, Associated First National Theatres, Inc., with 5,000 independent theater owners as members.\nAssociated First National Pictures expanded from only distributing films to producing them in 1924 and changed its corporate name to First National Pictures, Inc. It built its studio lot in Burbank in 1926. The Motion Picture Theatre Owners of America and the Independent Producers' Association declared war in 1925 on what they termed a common enemy\u2014the \"film trust\" of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount, and First National, which they claimed dominated the industry not only by producing and distributing motion pictures but also by entering into exhibition as well.\nAcquisition by Warner Bros..\nThe financial success of \"The Jazz Singer\" and \"The Singing Fool\" enabled Warner Bros. to purchase a majority interest in First National in September 1928. Warner Bros. held 42,000 shares of common stock out of 72,000 outstanding shares while Fox Pictures held 21,000 shares; 12,000 shares were publicly held. Warner Bros. acquired access to First National's affiliated chain of theatres, while First National acquired access to Vitaphone sound equipment. Warner Bros. and First National continued to operate as separate entities.\nOn November 4, 1929, Fox sold its interest in First National to Warner Bros. for $10 million. The First National studio in Burbank became the official home of Warner Bros.\u2013First National Pictures. Thereafter, First National Pictures became a trade name for the distribution of a designated segment of Warner Bros. product. 45 of the 86 Warner Bros. feature films released in 1929 were branded as First National Pictures. Half of the 60 feature films Warner Bros. announced for release in 1933\u20131934 were to be First National Pictures.\nAlthough both studios produced \"A\" and \"B\" budget pictures, generally the prestige productions, costume dramas, and musicals were made by Warner Bros., while First National specialized in modern comedies, dramas, and crime stories. Short subjects were made by yet another affiliated company, The Vitaphone Corporation (which took its name from the sound process).\nIn July 1936, stockholders of First National Pictures, Inc. (primarily Warner Bros.) voted to dissolve the corporation and distribute its assets among the stockholders in line with a new tax law which provided for tax-free consolidations between corporations. Although the 1939 release, \"Confessions of a Nazi Spy,\" was released as a First National Picture.\nFrom 1929 to 1958, most Warner Bros. films and promotional posters bore the trademark and copyright credits \"A Warner Bros.\u2013First National Picture\" in their opening and closing sequences."}

He is considered one of the leading figures of the New Hollywood and one of the greatest directors of all time. Coppola is the recipient of five Academy Awards, six Golden Globe Awards, two Palmes d'Or and a BAFTA Award.\nAfter directing \"The Rain People\" (1969), Coppola co-wrote \"Patton\" (1970), which earned him the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay along with Edmund H. North. Coppola's reputation as a filmmaker was cemented with the release of \"The Godfather\" (1972), which won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay and revolutionized the gangster genre. He directed \"The Godfather Part II\" (1974), which also won Best Picture and earned Coppola Best Director. Also in 1974, Coppola released the thriller \"The Conversation\", which received the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. \nHis next film, the Vietnam War epic \"Apocalypse Now\" (1979), had and also won the Palme d'Or, making Coppola one of only ten filmmakers to have won the award twice. Coppola later directed notable films such as \"The Outsiders\" and \"Rumble Fish\" (both 1983), \"The Cotton Club\" (1984), \"Peggy Sue Got Married\" (1986), \"The Godfather Part III\" (1990), \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" (1992) and \"The Rainmaker\" (1997). Coppola has acted as producer on such diverse films as \"American Graffiti\" (1973), \"The Black Stallion\" (1979), \"The Escape Artist\" and \"Hammett\" (both 1982), and \"The Secret Garden\" (1993).\nCoppola's father Carmine was a composer whose music featured in his son's films. Many of his relatives have found success in film: his sister Talia Shire is an actress, his daughter Sofia is a director, his son Roman is a screenwriter and his nephews Jason Schwartzman and Nicolas Cage are actors. In 1997, he cofounded the literary magazine \"\" with Adrienne Brodeur. Coppola resides in Napa, California, and since the 2010s has been a vintner, owning a family-branded winery of his own. In 2024, Coppola was feted at the Kennedy Center Honors. Introducing him, his friend George Lucas said: \u201cWhat Francis does creatively is jump off cliffs. When you spend enough time with Francis, you begin to believe you can jump off cliffs, too.\u201d\nEarly life and education.\nFrancis Ford Coppola was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1939, to father Carmine Coppola (1910\u20131991), a flautist with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra and mother Italia Coppola (n\u00e9e Pennino; 1912\u20132004), a family of second-generation Italian immigrants. His paternal grandparents came to the United States from Bernalda, Basilicata. His maternal grandfather, popular Italian composer Francesco Pennino, emigrated from Naples, Italy. At the time of Coppola's birth, his father was an arranger and assistant orchestra director for \"The Ford Sunday Evening Hour\", an hour-long concert music radio series sponsored by the Ford Motor Company. Coppola was born at Henry Ford Hospital, and those two connections to Henry Ford inspired the Coppolas to choose the middle name \"Ford\" for their son.\nFrancis is the middle of three children: his older brother was August Coppola, and his younger sister is actress Talia Shire.\nTwo years after Coppola's birth, his father was named principal flutist for the NBC Symphony Orchestra, under the baton of Arturo Toscanini, and the family moved to New York. They settled in Woodside, Queens, where Coppola spent the remainder of his childhood.\nHaving contracted polio as a boy, Coppola was bedridden for large periods of his childhood, during which he did homemade puppet theater productions. He developed an interest in theater after reading \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1947) at age 15. He created 8\u00a0mm feature films edited from home movies with titles such as \"The Rich Millionaire\" and \"The Lost Wallet\". Although Coppola was a mediocre student, his interest in technology and engineering earned him the childhood nickname \"Science\". He trained initially for a career in music and became proficient in the tuba, eventually earning a music scholarship to the New York Military Academy. In all, Coppola attended 23 schools before he eventually graduated from Great Neck North High School.\nHe entered Hofstra University in 1955 as a theater arts major. There, he was awarded a scholarship in playwriting. This furthered his interest in directing theater, though his father disapproved and wanted him to study engineering. Coppola was profoundly impressed by Sergei Eisenstein's film \"\" (1928), especially the quality of its editing, and decided to pursue cinema rather than theater. He said he was influenced to become a writer by his brother August. Coppola also credits the work of Elia Kazan for influencing him as a writer and director. Coppola's classmates at Hofstra included James Caan, Lainie Kazan and radio artist Joe Frank. He later cast Kazan and Caan in his films.\nWhile pursuing his bachelor's degree, Coppola was elected president of the university's drama group, The Green Wig, and its musical comedy club, the Kaleidoscopians. He merged the two groups into The Spectrum Players, and under his leadership, the group staged a new production each week. Coppola also founded the cinema workshop at Hofstra and contributed prolifically to the campus literary magazine. He won three D. H. Lawrence Awards for theatrical production and direction and received a Beckerman Award for his outstanding contributions to the school's theater arts division. While a graduate student, Coppola studied under professor Dorothy Arzner, whose encouragement was later acknowledged as pivotal to Coppola's career.\nCareer.\n1960\u20131969: Early works.\nAfter earning his theater arts degree from Hofstra in 1960, Coppola enrolled in UCLA Film School. There, he directed a short horror film, \"The Two Christophers\", inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's \"William Wilson\" and \"Ayamonn the Terrible\", a film about a sculptor's nightmares coming to life. He also met undergraduate film major Jim Morrison, future frontman of The Doors.\nIn the early 1960s, Coppola made $10 per week (roughly equivalent to $ per week today). Looking for a way to earn some extra money, he found that many colleagues from film school made money filming erotic productions known as \"nudie-cuties\" or \"skin flicks\", which showed nudity without implying any sexual act. At 21, Coppola wrote the script for \"The Peeper\", a short comedy film about a voyeur who tries to spy on a sensual photo shoot in the studio next to his apartment. Coppola found an interested producer, who gave him $3,000 to shoot the film. He hired Playboy Bunny Marli Renfro to play the model and had his friend Karl Schanzer play the voyeur. With \"The Peeper\" finished, Coppola found that the cartoonish aspects of the film alienated potential buyers, who did not find the 12-minute short exciting enough to screen in adult theaters.\nAfter much rejection, Coppola received an opportunity from Premier Pictures Company, a small production company that invested in \"The Wide Open Spaces\", an erotic western written and directed by Jerry Schafer, which had been shelved for more than a year. Both Schafer's film and \"The Peeper\" featured Renfro, so the producers paid Coppola $500 to combine the two films. After Coppola re-edited the picture, it was released as the softcore comedy \"Tonight for Sure\" (1962). Another production company, Screen Rite Pictures, hired Coppola to do a similar job: re-cutting the German film \"\" (\"Sin Began with Eve\"), directed by Fritz Umgelter. Coppola added new color footage with British model June Wilkinson and other nude starlets. The re-edited film was released as \"The Bellboy and the Playgirls\". That same year, producer/director Roger Corman hired Coppola as an assistant. Corman first tasked Coppola with dubbing and re-editing the Soviet science fiction film \"Nebo Zovyot\" (1959), which Coppola turned into the sex-and-violence monster movie \"Battle Beyond the Sun\" (1962). Impressed by Coppola's perseverance and dedication, Corman hired him as a dialogue director for \"Tower of London\" (1962), sound man for \"The Young Racers\" (1963) and associate producer and one of many uncredited directors for \"The Terror\" (1963).\nCoppola's first feature film was \"Dementia 13\" (1963). While on location in Ireland for \"The Young Racers\", Corman persuaded Coppola to use that film's leftover funds to make a low-budget horror movie. Coppola wrote a brief draft in one night, incorporating elements from Hitchcock's \"Psycho\", and the result impressed Corman enough to give the go-ahead. On a budget of $40,000 ($20,000 from Corman and $20,000 from another producer who wanted to buy the movie's English rights), Coppola directed \"Dementia 13\" over the course of nine days. The film recouped its expenses and later became a cult film among horror buffs. It was on the set of \"Dementia 13\" that Coppola met the woman he would marry, Eleanor Jessie Neil.\nIn 1965, Coppola won the annual Samuel Goldwyn Award for best screenplay written by a UCLA student for \"Pilma, Pilma\". The honor secured him a job as a scriptwriter with Seven Arts. During this time, Coppola also co-wrote the scripts for \"This Property Is Condemned\" (1966) and \"Is Paris Burning?\" (1966). Coppola bought the rights to David Benedictus's novel \"You're a Big Boy Now\" (1963) and merged it with a story idea of his own, resulting in his UCLA thesis project \"You're a Big Boy Now\" (1966), which earned him his Master of Fine Arts Degree from UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television in 1967. The film also received a theatrical release via Warner Bros. and earned critical acclaim.\nFollowing the success of \"You're a Big Boy Now\", Coppola was offered to work on an adaptation of the musical \"Finian's Rainbow\" starring dance legend Fred Astaire and Petula Clark in her first American film. Producer Jack L. Warner was not impressed by Coppola's shaggy-haired, bearded, \"hippie\" appearance and generally left him to his own devices. Coppola took the cast to the Napa Valley for much of the outdoor shooting, but those scenes were in sharp contrast to those filmed on a Hollywood soundstage, resulting in a disjointed look. None the less, \"Finian's Rainbow\" (1968) was a critical and commercial success. Clark received a Golden Globe Best Actress nomination. The film introduced Coppola to George Lucas, who became a lifelong friend and a production assistant on his next film.\n\"The Rain People\" (1969) was written, directed, and initially produced by Coppola himself, though as the movie advanced, he exceeded his budget and the studio had to underwrite the remainder of the movie. It won the Golden Shell at the 1969 San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival. Coppola wanted to subvert the studio system, which he felt had stifled his visions, intending to produce mainstream pictures to finance off-beat projects and give first-time directors a chance. While touring Europe, Coppola was introduced to alternative filmmaking equipment and, inspired by the bohemian spirit of Lanterna Film, decided he would build a deviant studio that would conceive and implement unconventional approaches to filmmaking. He decided to name his future studio \"Zoetrope\" after receiving a gift of zoetropes from Mogens Scot-Hansen, founder of Lanterna Film. Upon his return home, Coppola and Lucas searched for a mansion in Marin County to house the studio. However, in 1969, with equipment flowing in and no mansion found yet, the first home for Zoetrope Studio was a warehouse in San Francisco on Folsom Street. Andrew Sarris, in \"The American Cinema\" (1968), wrote: \"[Coppola] is probably the first reasonably talented and sensibly adaptable directorial talent to emerge from a university curriculum in film-making\u00a0... [He] may be heard from more decisively in the future.\"\n1970\u20131979: \"The Godfather\" and acclaim.\n\"Patton\" (1970).\nCoppola co-wrote the script for \"Patton\" starting in 1963 along with Edmund H. North. This earned him his first Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. However, it was not easy for Coppola to convince Franklin J. Schaffner that the opening scene would work. Coppola later revealed in an interview,\nWhen the title role was offered to George C. Scott, he remembered having read Coppola's screenplay earlier. He stated flatly that he would accept the part only if they used Coppola's script. \"Scott is the one who resurrected my version,\" said Coppola.\nThe movie opens with Scott's rendering of Patton's famous military \"Pep Talk\" to members of the Third Army, set against a huge American flag. Coppola and North had to tone down Patton's actual language to avoid an R rating; in the opening monologue, the word \"fornicating\" replaced \"fucking\" when criticizing \"The Saturday Evening Post\". Over the years, this opening monologue has become an iconic scene and has spawned parodies in numerous films, political cartoons, and television shows.\n\"The Godfather\" (1972).\n\"The Godfather\" (1972) was a turning point in Coppola's career. However, he faced several difficulties while filming. Paramount had owned the rights to Mario Puzo's novel, about an American mafia family, for several years. Coppola was not Paramount's first choice to direct; Sergio Leone was initially offered the job but declined in order to direct his own gangster opus, \"Once Upon a Time in America\". Robert Evans wanted the picture to be directed by an Italian American to make it \"ethnic to the core\". Evans' chief assistant Peter Bart suggested Coppola, as a director of Italian ancestry who would work for a low sum and budget after the poor reception of \"The Rain People\". Coppola initially turned down the job because he found Puzo's novel sleazy and sensationalist, describing it as \"pretty cheap stuff\". At the time, Coppola's studio American Zoetrope owed over $400,000 to Warner Bros. for budget overruns on \"THX 1138\" and, when coupled with his poor financial standing, along with advice from friends and family, Coppola reversed his initial decision and took the job. \nCoppola was officially announced as director of the film on September 28, 1970. He agreed to receive $125,000 and six percent of the gross rentals. Coppola later found a deeper theme for the material and decided it should be not just be a film about organized crime, but also a family saga and a metaphor for capitalism in America. The story follows the Corleone family as patriarch Vito Corleone passes the reins of power to his son Michael. There was disagreement between Paramount and Coppola on casting; Coppola wanted to cast Marlon Brando as Vito, though Paramount wanted either Ernest Borgnine or Danny Thomas. Orson Welles was also considered. At one point, Coppola was told by the then-president of Paramount that \"Marlon Brando will never appear in this motion picture.\" After pleading with the executives, Coppola was allowed to cast Brando only if he appeared in the film for much less money than his previous films, would perform a screen test, and put up a bond saying that he would not cause a delay in the production (as he had done on previous film sets). Coppola chose Brando over Borgnine on the basis of Brando's screen test, which also won over the Paramount leadership. Coppola would later recall:\nThe film was a critical and commercial success, setting the box office record. Pauline Kael wrote: Coppola, a young director who has never had a big hit, may have done the movie for money, as he claims\u2014in order to make the pictures he really wants to make, he says\u2014but this picture was made at peak capacity. He has salvaged Puzo\u2019s energy and lent the narrative dignity. Given the circumstances and the rush to complete the film and bring it to market, Coppola has not only done his best but pushed himself farther than he may realize. The movie is on the heroic scale of earlier pictures on broad themes, such as \"On the Waterfront\", \"From Here to Eternity\", and \"The Nun\u2019s Story\". It offers a wide, startlingly vivid view of a Mafia dynasty. The abundance is from the book; the quality of feeling is Coppola\u2019s ... The direction is tenaciously intelligent. Coppola holds on and pulls it all together. The trash novel is there underneath, but he attempts to draw the patterns out of the particulars. It\u2019s amazing how encompassing the view seems to be\u2014what a sense you get of a broad historical perspective, considering that the span is only from 1945 to the mid-fifties, at which time the Corleone family, already forced by competitive pressures into dealing in narcotics, is moving its base of operations to Las Vegas.\nIn addition to Brando, the film starred Al Pacino, James Caan, John Cazale and Robert Duvall. It featured Richard Castellano, Sterling Hayden, Diane Keaton and Coppola's sister Talia Shire. Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor, which he refused to accept. The film won Best Picture and the Best Adapted Screenplay. Coppola was nominated for Best Director but lost to Bob Fosse for \"Cabaret\". For the score, Coppola commissioned Nino Rota, who had scored many Fellini films. Gordon Willis's chiaroscuro cinematography was acclaimed, as was Dean Tavoularis's period production design.\nThe film routinely ranks near the top of polls for the greatest movies ever. It was ranked third, behind \"Citizen Kane\" (1941) and \"Casablanca\" (1942), on the American Film Institute's inaugural AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies list in 1997. In 2007, it had moved to second place, ahead of \"Casablanca\" and behind \"Kane\". David Thomson writes that \"\"The Godfather\" deserved all its success because it had the nerve to take its 175 minutes slowly ... It has a calm faith in narrative control that had not been current in Hollywood for twenty years. It was like a film of the forties in its nostalgic decor; its command of great supporting actors; in Gordon Willis's bold exploration of a film noir in color; and in its fascination with evil.\"\n\"The Conversation\" (1974).\n\"The Conversation\" (1974) further cemented Coppola's reputation. It was influenced by Michelangelo Antonioni's \"Blowup\" (1966) and generated much interest when news leaked that it featured the same surveillance and wire-tapping equipment that members of the Nixon administration used to spy on political opponents in the Watergate scandal. Coppola claimed that this was purely coincidental, as the script for \"The Conversation\" was completed in the mid-1960s. However, audiences interpreted the film as a reaction to Watergate and its fallout. It stars Gene Hackman as Harry Caul, \"the best bugger on the West Coast\", hired to spy on a young couple played by Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest. It features Cazale as his partner, Stan. The movie was a critical success and won Coppola his first Palme d'Or at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival. Coppola's brother-in-law David Shire wrote the score and Walter Murch edited the picture, as Coppola started work on his next project.\n\"The Godfather Part II\" (1974).\n\"The Godfather Part II\" is both prequel and sequel to the first film, telling parallel stories of the rise of young Vito Corleone and the fall of his son Michael. After its five-hour-long preview, George Lucas told Coppola, \"You have two films. Take one away, it doesn't work.\" Coppola claims it was the first major motion picture to use \"Part II\" in its title; he was influenced by Sergei Eisenstein's two-part \"Ivan the Terrible\". Paramount was initially opposed to his decision to name the movie \"The Godfather Part II\". According to Coppola, the studio's objection stemmed from the belief that audiences would be reluctant to see a film with such a title, as the audience would supposedly believe that, having already seen \"The Godfather\", there was little reason to see an addition to the original film. However, the success of \"The Godfather Part II\" began the Hollywood tradition of numbered sequels.\nThe movie received tremendous critical acclaim, with many deeming it superior to its predecessor. Kael wrote: Coppola has plunged us back into the sensuality and terror of the first film. And, with the relentlessness of a master, he goes farther and farther. The daring of Part II is that it enlarges the scope and deepens the meaning of the first film ... The first film covered the period from 1945 to the mid-fifties. Part II, contrasting the early manhood of Vito (played by Robert De Niro) with the life of Michael, his inheritor (AI Pacino), spans almost seventy years. We saw only the middle of the story in the first film; now we have the beginning and the end. Structurally, the completed work is nothing less than the rise and decay of an American dynasty of unofficial rulers ... Part II has the same mythic and operatic visual scheme as the first; once again the cinematographer is Gordon Willis. Visually the film is, however, far more complexly beautiful than the first, just as it\u2019s thematically richer, more shadowed, more full. Willis\u2019s workmanship has developed, like Coppola\u2019s; even the sequences in the sunlight have deep tones \u2014 elegiac yet lyrical, as in \"The Conformist\", and always serving the narrative, as the Nino Rota score also does. \nIn addition to Pacino, Cazale, Duvall, Keaton and Shire reprised their roles from the first film. Newcomers included Michael V. Gazzo and Pacino's mentor Lee Strasberg. \"The Godfather Part II\" was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and won six, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Director. De Niro won Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Vito, making him and Brando the first actors to win Oscars for playing the same character. The film ranked at No. 32 on AFI's inaugural 100 Years...100 Movies list, maintaining its position ten years later. It is ranked No. 1 on \"TV Guide\" \"50 Best Movies of All Time\" and at No. 7 on \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s list of the \"100 Greatest Movies of All Time\". Together, the two \"Godfather\"s placed at No. 4 on \"Sight &amp; Sound\" 2002 list of the ten greatest films of all time. Thomson writes that \"it exhibited a mastery of so many periods and locations as to be entrancing.\" It was one of the last major American motion pictures to be filmed in Technicolor.\n\"Apocalypse Now\" (1979).\nFollowing the success of \"The Godfather\", \"The Conversation\" and \"The Godfather Part II\", Coppola began filming \"Apocalypse Now\", an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness\" (1899) set in Cambodia during the Vietnam War. It follows Willard (Martin Sheen) as he journeys upriver to find and assassinate the rogue Kurtz (Brando). The production in the Philippines was plagued by numerous problems, including typhoons, nervous breakdowns, the firing of Harvey Keitel, Sheen's heart attack, Brando arriving overweight and unprepared and extras from the Philippine military and half of the supplied helicopters leaving in the middle of scenes to fight rebels. It was delayed so often it was nicknamed \"Apocalypse When?\" \n\"Apocalypse Now\" premiered at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival, where Coppola made grandiose claims, among them: \"My film is not about Vietnam, it \"is\" Vietnam.\" Despite such pronouncements, and complaints from critics that the film's message was confused, it shared the Palme d'Or with Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff's \"The Tin Drum\" and won Oscars for Best Cinematography (Vittorio Storaro) and Best Sound (Murch, Mark Berger, Richard Beggs and Nat Boxer.) Roger Ebert wrote: \nThe film's reputation has grown and it is now regarded by many as a masterpiece of the New Hollywood and is frequently cited as one of the greatest movies ever made, ranking at Number 19 on the 2022 \"Sight and Sound\" poll. For the film, Murch was the first person to receive a credit as a Sound Designer. \nThe documentary \"\" (1991), directed by George Hickenlooper, Fax Bahr and Francis's wife, Eleanor Coppola, who was present through the production, chronicles the difficulties the crew went through making \"Apocalypse Now\" and features behind-the-scenes footage filmed by Eleanor. Coppola famously stated, \"We were in the jungle, there were too many of us, we had access to too much money, too much equipment and little by little, we went insane.\"\n1980\u20131989: Hard Times.\n\"Apocalypse Now\" marked the end of the 'golden phase' of Coppola's career. His Las Vegas-set musical fantasy \"One from the Heart\" (1982), while pioneering in its use of video-editing techniques, ended with a disastrous box-office gross of US$636,796 against a $26-million budget, and he was forced to sell the 23-acre Zoetrope Studio in 1983. He would spend the rest of the decade working to pay off his debts. Ebert wrote that the film was \"a ballet of graceful and complex camera movements occupying magnificent sets, and somehow the characters get lost in the process ... The storyteller of \"The Godfather\" has become a technician here. There are chilling parallels between Coppola\u2019s obsessive control of this film and the character of Harry Caul, the wiretapper in Coppola\u2019s \"The Conversation\" (1974), who cared only about technical results and refused to let himself think about human consequences.\" Later critical evaluation has been more positive; Thomson calls the film \"enchanting and touching\". \"One From the Heart\" starred Forrest, Teri Garr, Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1, Nastassja Kinski and was scored by Tom Waits. \nIn 1983, he directed \"The Outsiders\", an adaptation of the novel of the same name by S. E. Hinton. Coppola credited his inspiration for making the film to a suggestion from middle school students who had read the novel. \"The Outsiders\" is notable for being the breakout film for a number of young actors who would go on to become major stars, including Matt Dillon, Ralph Macchio and C. Thomas Howell. Also in the cast were Patrick Swayze, Emilio Estevez, Diane Lane, Tom Cruise and Rob Lowe (in his film debut). Carmine Coppola wrote and edited the score, including the title song \"Stay Gold\", which was based on Robert Frost's \"Nothing Gold Can Stay\" and performed by Stevie Wonder. He directed \"Rumble Fish\", filmed at the same time as \"The Outsiders\" on-location in Tulsa, Oklahoma and based on the novel of the same name by Hinton, who co-wrote the screenplay. Shot in black-and-white as an homage to German expressionism, \"Rumble Fish\" centers on the relationship between a revered former gang leader (Mickey Rourke) and his younger brother, Rusty James (Dillon). The film bombed at the box office, earning a meager $2.5\u00a0million against a $10\u00a0million budget. \nIn 1984, Coppola directed the Robert Evans-produced \"The Cotton Club\", based on the novel by James Haskins and centered on the eponymous Harlem jazz club. The film was nominated for several awards, including the Golden Globes for Best Director and Best Picture (Drama) and Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Art-Direction. However, the film failed at the box-office, earning only $25.9\u00a0million of the $47.9\u00a0million privately invested by brothers Fred and Ed Doumani. The same year, he directed \"Rip Van Winkle\", an adaptation of Washington Irving's short story starring Harry Dean Stanton for Shelley Duvall's \"Faerie Tale Theatre\". \nIn 1986, Coppola directed \"Captain EO\", a 17-minute space fantasy for Disney theme parks executive produced by George Lucas and starring Michael Jackson. Coppola, formerly a member of Writers Guild of America West, left and maintained financial core status in 1986. Also in 1986, Coppola released the comedy \"Peggy Sue Got Married\" starring Kathleen Turner, Jim Carrey and Coppola's nephew Nicolas Cage. The film earned Coppola positive reviews and Turner her first and only Oscar nomination. It was Coppola's first box-office success since \"The Outsiders\" and ranked number 17 on \"Entertainment Weekly\"s list of \"50 Best High School Movies\".\nThe following year, Coppola re-teamed with James Caan for \"Gardens of Stone\", but the film was overshadowed by the death of Coppola's eldest son Gian-Carlo during the film's production. The movie was not a critical success and underperformed commercially, earning only $5.6\u00a0million against a $13\u00a0million budget. Coppola directed \"\" the year after that. The film is a biopic based on the life of Preston Tucker and his attempt to produce and market the Tucker '48; Coppola had originally conceived the project as a musical with Brando leading. Ultimately, it was Jeff Bridges who played the role of Tucker. Budgeted at $24\u00a0million, the film received positive reviews and earned three nominations at the 62nd Academy Awards, but grossed a disappointing $19.65\u00a0million at the box office. It garnered two awards: Martin Landau won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor and Dean Tavoularis took BAFTA's honors for Best Production Design.\nIn 1989, Coppola teamed up with fellow Oscar-winners Martin Scorsese and Woody Allen for the anthology film \"New York Stories\". Coppola directed the \"Life Without Zo\u00eb\" segment, starring Shire and co-written with his daughter Sofia. \"Life Without Zo\u00eb\" was mostly panned by critics and was generally considered to be the segment that brought the film's overall quality down. Hal Hinson of \"The Washington Post\" wrote a particularly scathing review, stating: \"It's impossible to know what Francis Coppola's \"Life Without Zo\u00eb\" is. Co-written with his daughter Sofia, the film is a mystifying embarrassment; it's by far the director's worst work yet.\" Zoetrope Studios finally filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1990, after which its name was changed to American Zoetrope.\n1990\u20131999: Continued work.\n\"The Godfather Part III\" (1990).\nIn 1990, he released the third and final chapter of \"The Godfather\" series: \"The Godfather Part III\". Coppola felt that the first two films had told the complete Corleone saga. Coppola intended \"Part III\" to be an epilogue to the first two films. In his audio commentary for \"Part II\", he stated that only a dire financial situation caused by the failure of \"One from the Heart\" (1982) compelled him to take up Paramount's long-standing offer to make a third installment. Coppola and Puzo preferred the title \"The Death of Michael Corleone\", but Paramount Pictures found that unacceptable. While not as critically acclaimed as the first two films, it was still commercially successful, earning $136\u00a0million against a $54\u00a0million budget. Some reviewers criticized the casting of Coppola's daughter Sofia, who stepped into the leading role of Mary Corleone, which was abandoned by Winona Ryder just as filming began. Despite this, \"The Godfather Part III\" went on to gather seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Director and Best Picture. The film failed to win any of these awards, which made it the only film in the trilogy to do so.\nIn September 2020, for the film's 30th anniversary, it was announced that a new cut of the film titled \"Mario Puzo's The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone\" would have a limited theatrical release in December 2020 followed by digital and Blu-ray. Coppola said the film is the version he and Puzo had originally envisioned, and it \"vindicates\" its status among the trilogy and his daughter Sofia's performance.\n\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" (1992).\nIn 1992, Coppola directed and produced \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\". Adapted from Bram Stoker's novel, it was intended to follow the book more closely than previous film adaptations. Coppola cast Gary Oldman as the titular role, with Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder, and Anthony Hopkins in supporting roles. The movie became a box-office hit, grossing $82,522,790 domestically, making it the 15th highest-grossing film of the year. It fared even better out of the country, grossing $133,339,902 for a total worldwide gross of $215,862,692 against a budget of $40\u00a0million, making it the ninth highest-grossing film of the year worldwide. The film won Academy Awards for Costume Design, Makeup and Sound Editing.\n\"Jack\" (1996).\nCoppola's next project was \"Jack\", which was released on August 9, 1996. It starred Robin Williams as Jack Powell, a ten-year-old boy whose cells are growing at four times the normal rate due to Werner syndrome, which makes him look like a 40-year-old man at the age of ten. With Diane Lane, Brian Kerwin, and Bill Cosby, \"Jack\" also featured Jennifer Lopez, Fran Drescher and Michael McKean in supporting roles. Although a moderate box-office success, grossing $58\u00a0million domestically on an estimated $45\u00a0million budget, it was panned by critics, many of whom disliked the film's abrupt contrast between actual comedy and tragic melodrama. It was also unfavorably compared with the 1988 film \"Big\", in which Tom Hanks also played a child in a grown man's body. Most critics felt that the screenplay was poorly written, not funny, and had unconvincing and unbelievable drama. Other critics felt that Coppola was too talented to be making this type of film. Although ridiculed for making the film, Coppola has defended it, saying he is not ashamed of the final cut of the movie. He had been friends with Robin Williams for many years and had always wanted to work with him as an actor. When Williams was offered the screenplay for \"Jack\", he said he would only agree to do it if Coppola agreed to sign on as director.\n\"The Rainmaker\" (1997).\nThe last film Coppola directed in the 1990s, \"The Rainmaker\", was based on the 1995 novel of the same name by John Grisham. An ensemble courtroom drama, the film was well received by critics. Roger Ebert gave \"The Rainmaker\" three stars out of four, remarking: \"I have enjoyed several of the movies based on Grisham novels\u00a0... but I've usually seen the storyteller's craft rather than the novelist's art being reflected. By keeping all of the little people in focus, Coppola shows the variety of a young lawyer's life, where every client is necessary and most of them need a lot more than a lawyer.\" James Berardinelli also gave the film three stars out of four, saying that \"the intelligence and subtlety of \"The Rainmaker\" took me by surprise\" and that the film \"stands above any other filmed Grisham adaptation.\" Grisham said of the film: \"To me it's the best adaptation of any of [my books]\u00a0... I love the movie. It's so well done.\" The film grossed about $45\u00a0million domestically, more than the estimated production budget of $40\u00a0million, but a disappointment compared to previous films adapted from Grisham novels.\nAccording to Coppola, starting from this film onwards, he stopped working as a \"professional director\", preferring to act more like a student who tried to understand what meant making a film, choosing to self-finance some \"very small, low-budget\" movies. Thus, those films weren't meant to be successful but instead teach him what making films really mean, learning a lout about acting to the point of carrying out unusual rehearsals.\n2000\u20132018: Career fluctuations.\n\"Supernova\" re-edit.\nIn the late 90's Coppola was a board member of MGM, and in discussion of films they already had which could not be released, \"Supernova\" was among the most expensive. He was approached to supervise several of these, including \"The Fantastiks\" and\u00a0\"Supernova\", which he used his American Zoetrope facility in Northern California. This work included digitally placing Angela Bassett's and James Spader's faces on the bodies of (a computer-tinted) Robin Tunney and Peter Facinelli so that their characters could have a love scene. However, Coppola's re-edited version had negative test screening and didn't get the PG-13 rating by the MPAA that the studio wanted. Creature designer Patrick Tatopoulos, whose special effects were mostly cut out from the film, said that Walter Hill wanted the film to be much more grotesque, strange, and disturbing, while MGM wanted to make it more of a hip, sexy film in space, and not with full-blown makeup effects. \"I hope that my experience in the film industry has helped improve the picture and rectified some of the problems that losing a director caused\", said Coppola. By October 1999, MGM decided to sell the film. The film was eventually released on January 17, 2000, almost two years later than planned.\nCoppola was the jury president at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival and he also took part as a special guest at the 17th Midnight Sun Film Festival in Sodankyl\u00e4, Finland, and the 46th International Thessaloniki Film Festival in Thessaloniki, Greece.\n\"Apocalypse Now Redux\".\nIn the late '90s, Coppola began revisiting his films and creating new director's cuts for release on home video. The first movie to receive this treatment was \"Apocalypse Now\". The new version, \"Apocalypse Now Redux\", restored 49 minutes that had been cut from the film before its original release in 1979, notably a visit to a French plantation. A number of actors came in to rerecord their lines for the deleted scenes, which were of inconsistent audio quality, and new music was composed. This version was released in cinemas in 2001 and later released on DVD. In 2006, it was collected with the theatrical cut on a deluxe DVD; subsequent home video releases have included both versions.\nA. O. Scott wrote: \"\"Apocalypse Now Redux\" arrives in this slack season to remind us of a lost era of visionary cinema, a time of creative self-confidence that frequently flirted with hubris, but also a time of risk taking and high seriousness. The artistic vision on display in \"Apocalypse Now\" -- the divine madness that inspired Mr. Coppola to risk his health, his sanity, his fortune and the well-being of his cast, crew and family -- is ultimately less impressive, and less important to the film's durable power, than the art itself.\"\nIn 2005, Coppola created a new cut of \"The Outsiders\" for home video. This version, titled \"The Outsiders: The Complete Novel\", added more than 20 minutes of footage and removed three scenes, bringing the film's runtime from 91 minutes to 114 minutes. It also added new music by Michael Seifert and Dave Pruitt and several period songs to Carmine Coppola's score. Coppola included both the theatrical cut and \"The Complete Novel\" on all subsequent home video releases.\nReturn.\nAfter a ten-year hiatus, Coppola returned to directing with \"Youth Without Youth\" in 2007, based on the novella of the same name by Romanian author Mircea Eliade. The film received generally negative reviews from critics. It was made for about $19\u00a0million and had a limited release, only managing $2,624,759 at the box-office. As a result, Coppola announced his plans to produce his own films in order to avoid the marketing input that goes into most films, which are intended to appeal to too wide an audience.\nIn 2009, Coppola released \"Tetro\". It was set in Argentina, with the reunion of two brothers. The story follows the rivalries born out of creative differences passed down through generations of an artistic Italian immigrant family. The film received generally positive reviews from critics. The Rotten Tomatoes site's consensus was: \"A complex meditation on family dynamics, \"Tetro\" arresting visuals and emotional core compensate for its uneven narrative.\" Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film three stars, praising it for being \"boldly operatic, involving family drama, secrets, generations at war, melodrama, romance and violence\", Ebert also praised Vincent Gallo's performance and claimed that Alden Ehrenreich is \"the new Leonardo DiCaprio\". Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" gave the film a B+, judging that \"when Coppola finds creative nirvana, he frequently has trouble delivering the full goods\". Richard Corliss of \"Time\" gave the film a mixed review, praising Ehrenreich's performance, but claiming Coppola \"has made a movie in which plenty happens, but nothing rings true\". The film made $2,636,774 worldwide, against a budget of $5,000,000.\n\"Twixt\", starring Val Kilmer, Elle Fanning, Joanne Whalley, and Bruce Dern, and narrated by Tom Waits, was released to film festivals in late 2011 and was released theatrically in early 2012. It received critical acclaim in France, but mostly negative reviews elsewhere.\nIn 2015, Coppola stated\"Distant Vision\" is a semi-autobiographical unfinished live broadcast project created in real-time. Proof of concepts were tested before limited audiences at Oklahoma City Community College in June 2015 and UCLA School of Theater in July 2016.\nFurther director's cuts.\nIn 2015, Coppola found an old Betamax tape with his original cut of \"The Cotton Club\" and decided to restore it. He had cut about a half hour out of the film before its original release at the insistence of the film's European financial backers. Due to a combination of music rights, the loss of the original negative, audio issues, and MGM's lack of interest in the project, Coppola wound up spending 500,000 dollars of his own money restoring the film. It was finally finished in 2017 and premiered at the Telluride Film Festival in 2019 as \"The Cotton Club Encore\".\nAfter finishing work on \"The Cotton Club\", Coppola began work on a director's cut of his first movie, \"Dementia 13\". For this film, Coppola removed several minutes of footage that had been added by the film's producer, Roger Corman. In 2019, he followed it up with another director's cut of \"Apocalypse Now\", this time called \"The Final Cut\". It removed 20 minutes of footage that had been included in \"Apocalypse Now Redux\" and restored the film from the original negative for the first time.\nIn December 2020, a re-edit of \"Godfather III\", \"The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone\" had a limited theatrical release, followed by digital and Blu-ray release in 2021. Coppola stated that \"The Godfather: Part IV\" was never made because Mario Puzo died before they had a chance to write the film. Andy Garc\u00eda has since claimed the film's script was nearly produced.\nCoppola's most recent director's cut to date was \"B'Twixt Now and Sunrise\", a shortened version of his film \"Twixt\". It was given a select re-release in 2022.\nAt the 94th Academy Awards, they celebrated the 50th anniversary of \"The Godfather\". Coppola attended alongside Robert De Niro and Al Pacino who were greeted with a standing ovation.\n2019\u2013present.\n\"Megalopolis\" (2024).\nIn April 2019, Coppola announced that he planned to direct \"Megalopolis\", which he had been developing for many years prior. Speaking to \"Deadline\", he said: \"I plan this year to begin my longstanding ambition to make a major work utilizing all I have learned during my long career, beginning at age 16 doing theater, and that will be an epic on a grand scale, which I've titled \"Megalopolis\".\" He had planned to direct the movie, a story about the aftermath and reconstruction of New York City after a mega-disaster, many years earlier, but after the real-life disaster of the September 11 attacks, the project was seen as being too sensitive.\nIn August 2021, it was announced that Coppola had begun discussions with actors for the project and that he was aiming to begin principal photography in the fall of 2022. In April 2022, it was reported that filming was to take place from September 6, 2022, to February 2, 2023. In May 2022, the star cast was revealed: Adam Driver, Forest Whitaker, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jon Voight, and Laurence Fishburne. In July, it was reported that filming would instead begin in November 2022 at Trilith Studios in Fayetteville, Georgia. In August, it was revealed that Aubrey Plaza, Talia Shire, Shia LaBeouf, Jason Schwartzman, Kathryn Hunter, James Remar, and Grace VanderWaal joined the cast. In early October, it was announced that Chloe Fineman, Dustin Hoffman, Bailey Ives, Isabelle Kusman, and D.B. Sweeney would also be joining the cast.\nOn February 29, 2024, \"Deadline\" reported that \"Megalopolis\" will be released in IMAX in Fall 2024. On April 9, 2024, it was revealed that \"Megalopolis\" would be premiering in competition at the 77th Cannes Film Festival.\nFuture projects.\nIn August 2024, one month ahead of the release of \"Megalopolis\", Coppola told \"Rolling Stone\" that he is not going to retire after his longtime passion project's release, intending to work on two projects: an adaptation of \"The Glimpses of the Moon\" with \"strong dance and musical elements\" he plans to produce in England and \"Distant Vision\", a \"live cinema\" project he's been working on since 2015 that tells the fictionalized story of three generations within an Italian American family during the phenomenon of television's invention.\nCommercial ventures.\nAmerican Zoetrope.\nIn 1971, Coppola produced George Lucas' first feature film, \"THX 1138\". Shortly after completion of production they brought the finished film to Warner Bros., along with several other scripts for potential projects at their newly founded company, American Zoetrope. However, studio executives strongly disliked all of the scripts, including \"THX\", and demanded that Coppola repay the $300,000 they had loaned him for the Zoetrope studio, as well as insisting on cutting five minutes from the film. The debt nearly closed Zoetrope and forced Coppola to reluctantly focus on \"The Godfather\".\nAmerican Zoetrope produced the film \"Clownhouse\", the director of which, Victor Salva, was convicted of child sexual abuse and child pornography offences occurring during the making of that film. In 2006, Coppola said, \"You have to remember, while this was a tragedy, that the difference in age between Victor and the boy was very small -- Victor was practically a child himself.\" Salva was 29 at the time while the boy was 12.\nZoetrope Virtual Studio.\nAmerican Zoetrope also administers the Zoetrope Virtual Studio, a complete motion picture production studio for members only. Launched in June 2000 as the culmination of more than four years of work, it brings together departments for screenwriters, directors, producers and other filmmaker artists, as well as new departments for other creative endeavors such as the short story vending machine project.\n\"Pinocchio\" dispute with Warner Bros..\nIn the late 1980s, Coppola started considering concepts for a motion picture based upon the 19th-century Carlo Collodi novel \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\", and in 1991, Coppola and Warner Bros. began discussing the project as well as two others, one involving the life of J. Edgar Hoover and the other based on the children's novel \"The Secret Garden\". These discussions led to negotiations for Coppola to both produce and direct the \"Pinocchio\" project for Warner Bros. as well as \"The Secret Garden\" (which was made in 1993 and produced by American Zoetrope, but directed by Agnieszka Holland) and \"Hoover\", which never came to fruition. A film was eventually made by Clint Eastwood in 2011 titled \"J. Edgar\", which was distributed by Warner Bros.\nHowever, in mid-1991, Coppola and Warner Bros. came to a disagreement over the compensation to Coppola for his directing services on \"Pinocchio\". In 1994, Coppola later approached another studio, Columbia Pictures, to produce the film. Warner Brothers then wrote to Columbia, stating it had held the rights to Coppola's project, which led to Columbia later dropping the project. Coppola filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros, alleging they had wrongfully prevented Columbia Pictures from making the film.\nThe parties deferred this issue and a settlement was finally reached on July 3, 1998, when the jurors in the resultant court case awarded Coppola $20\u00a0million as compensation for losing the \"Pinocchio\" film project. On that same day, Warner Bros. stated it would appeal the decision. A week later, Coppola was awarded a further $60\u00a0million in punitive damages on top, stemming from his charges that Warner Bros. sabotaged his intended version. However, in October 1998, then-Superior Court Judge Madeleine Flier reversed the jury's $60\u00a0million award to Coppola. Warner Bros. and Coppola then appealed each other's ruling, in which Coppola sought to have his $60\u00a0million award restored. In March 2001, the California Court of Appeals decided against Coppola on both counts. In July 2001, the California Supreme Court refused to hear the appellate decision, bringing the litigation battle to a conclusive end.\n\"Contact\" dispute with Carl Sagan/Warner Bros..\nDuring the filming of \"Contact\" on December 28, 1996, Coppola filed a lawsuit against Carl Sagan and Warner Bros. Sagan had died a week earlier, and Coppola claimed that Sagan's novel \"Contact\" was based on a story the pair had developed for a television special back in 1975 titled \"First Contact\". Under their development agreement, Coppola and Sagan were to split proceeds from the project as well as any novel Sagan would write with American Zoetrope and Children's Television Workshop Productions. The television program was never produced, but in 1985, Simon &amp; Schuster published Sagan's \"Contact\" and Warner Bros. moved forward with development of a film adaptation. Coppola sought at least $250,000 in compensatory damages and an injunction against production or distribution of the film. Even though Sagan was shown to have violated some of the terms of the agreement, the case was dismissed in February 1998 because Coppola had waited too long to file suit.\nUptown Theater.\nGeorge Altamura, a real estate developer, announced in 2003 that he had partnered with several people, including Coppola, in a project to restore the Uptown Theater in downtown Napa, California, in order to create a live entertainment venue.\nFrancis Ford Coppola Presents.\nCoppola is the owner of Francis Ford Coppola Presents, a lifestyle brand under which he markets goods from companies he owns or controls.

His winery produced its first vintage in 1977 with the help of his father, wife, and children stomping the grapes barefoot. Every year, the family has a harvest party to continue the tradition.\nAfter purchasing the property, he produced wine under the Niebaum-Coppola label. He purchased the former Inglenook Winery chateau in 1995, and renamed it to Rubicon Estate Winery in 2006. On April 11, 2011, Coppola acquired the Inglenook trademark paying more, he said, for the trademark than he did for the entire estate and announced that the estate would once again be known by its historic original name, Inglenook. Its grapes are entirely organically grown.\nDomaine de Broglie.\nIn October 2018, Coppola and family purchased the Vista Hills winery in Dayton, Oregon, and in 2019 renamed it to Domaine de Broglie.\nResorts.\nIncluded in the Francis Ford Coppola Presents lifestyle brand are several hotels and resorts, part of Coppola's Hideaway company.

Rubicon closed in August 2008.\nLiterary publications.\nCoppola bought into the San Francisco-based magazine \"City of San Francisco\" in 1973,&lt;ref name=\"time/magazine/CitizenCoppola\"&gt;\n&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"theava/4034\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with the intent of publishing&lt;ref name=\"truthdig/godfather-gonzo\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"encyclopedia.com/francis-ford-coppola\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"thenation/authors/warren-hinckle\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"altaonline/a3503\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a \"service magazine\" that informed readers about sights and activities in selected cities. The magazine was unsuccessful,&lt;ref name=\"deseret/19237060\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and he lost $1.5\u00a0million on this venture.\nIn 1997, Coppola founded \"\", a literary magazine devoted to short stories and design. The magazine publishes fiction by emerging writers alongside more recognizable names, such as Woody Allen, Margaret Atwood, Haruki Murakami, Alice Munro, Don DeLillo, Mary Gaitskill, and Edward Albee; as well as essays, including ones from Mario Vargas Llosa, David Mamet, Steven Spielberg, and Salman Rushdie. Each issue is designed, in its entirety, by a prominent artist, one usually working outside his / her expected field. Previous guest designers include Gus Van Sant, Tom Waits, Laurie Anderson, Marjane Satrapi, Guillermo del Toro, David Bowie, David Byrne, and Dennis Hopper. Coppola serves as founding editor and publisher of \"All-Story\".\nCannabis brand.\nIn 2018, Coppola launched Sana Company LLC and released a cannabis brand known as The Grower's Series. The collection was created in partnership with the Humboldt Brothers, a Humboldt County cannabis farm. Coppola debuted the brand in San Francisco, California in October 2018 at the private cannabis dining club series known as Thursday Infused, organized by The Herb Somm, Jamie Evans. Coppola packaged The Grower's Series in a mock black tin wine bottle resembling his wine brand. The Grower's Series showcases three cannabis strains: a sativa, indica and hybrid.\nWhisky advertisement.\nCoppola appeared in a commercial for Suntory Reserve in 1980 alongside Akira Kurosawa; the commercial was filmed while Kurosawa was making \"Kagemusha\", which Coppola produced with George Lucas.\nPersonal life.\nFamily.\nIn 1963, Coppola married writer and documentary filmmaker Eleanor Jessie Neil.

The rally failed in its goal to draw attention away from the other Democratic primary candidates Jimmy Carter and Ted Kennedy, forcing Brown to drop out of the race. Over the years, Coppola has worked with several Democratic political candidates, including Mike Thompson and Nancy Pelosi for the U.S. House of Representatives, and Barbara Boxer and Alan Cranston for the U.S. Senate.\nFavorite films.\nIn 2012, Coppola participated in the \"Sight &amp; Sound\" film polls of that year. It is held every ten years to select the greatest films of all time, by asking contemporary directors to select ten films of their choice.\nCoppola's selections were:\nAwards and honors.\nFor \"The Godfather Part II\" and \"The Conversation\", Coppola was the third director to have two nominations for Best Picture in the same year. Victor Fleming was the first, with \"Gone with the Wind\" and \"The Wizard of Oz\" in 1939; Alfred Hitchcock repeated the feat the next year with \"Foreign Correspondent\" and \"Rebecca\". Since Coppola, two other directors have done the same: Herbert Ross with \"The Goodbye Girl\" and \"The Turning Point\" in 1977 and Steven Soderbergh with \"Erin Brockovich\" and \"Traffic\" in 2000. He is one of ten directors to receive the Palme d'Or twice, for \"The Conversation\" and \"Apocalypse Now\".\nOn October 15, 2024, after having received the statue of the Capitoline Wolf, Rome's highest honor, a street in the same capital city was named after him as a further sign of the connection between the filmmaker and the city.
