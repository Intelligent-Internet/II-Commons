Generate visual descriptions strictly following these rules:

=== Output Format ===
Pure YAML containing ONLY:
```yaml
caption.long: "Comprehensive description (256 chars maximum) MUST include:
   - [TEXT BLOCK] if present: Exact content, position, font style, color
   - Living subjects (details, actions, position)
   - Artistic style/medium characteristics
   - Photography terms (for photos)"

caption.short: "Essential phrase (77 chars maximum ) summarizing key elements"

=== Text Analysis Protocol ===

    Priority Detection:
        - Always check for text elements first
        - Use OCR-level precision for content extraction

    Mandatory Text Fields:
        - Content: "Exact verbatim text enclosed in quotes"
        - Position: "Coordinates (e.g. 'top 20%', 'bottom-right corner')"
        - Style: "Font type/size/color + background contrast"

    Integration Example:
        - GOOD: "The neon-red bold 48pt text 'OPEN 24/7' dominates the upper-left quadrant against dark asphalt"
        - BAD: "There's some text visible in the image"

=== Content Requirements ===

   1. Text Analysis (if present):
        - Describe text content, font characteristics, and layout position
        - Example: "The bold sans-serif slogan 'JUST DO IT' diagonally spans the top third"

   2. Subject Details (if applicable):
        - 3+ distinctive features for humans/animals
        - Position in frame and activities
        - Example: "A Siamese cat with azure eyes peers from behind left-aligned curtains"

   3. Style Characterization:
        - Artistic movement for paintings
        - Technical terms for photos
        - Example: "Impressionist oil brushstrokes" or "shallow depth-of-field bokeh"

   4. Unified Narrative:
        - Seamlessly integrate all elements into natural prose
        - Maintain technical accuracy without list formatting

=== Validation Examples ===

Valid Case 1 (Photo):

caption.long: "A street photography shot captures an elderly man reading 'Le Monde' at a Parisian café, his round glasses reflecting morning light. Captured with a 35mm lens at f/2.8, the shallow depth-of-field blurs bustling pedestrians behind the centrally framed subject."
caption.short: "Elderly man reading newspaper in Paris café with bokeh background"

Valid Case 2 (Artwork):

caption.long: "This surreal digital painting features a floating iceberg housing an ancient library, illuminated by bioluminescent algae. Bold Art Deco lettering 'ATLANTIS ARCHIVES' curves along the structure's base, contrasting cobalt blue tones with golden window light."
caption.short: "Surreal iceberg library with glowing algae and Art Deco text"

Valid Case 3 (Text Dominant):
caption.long: "A product poster features 'SALE 50% OFF' in giant yellow Impact font (center-top 15%) over red background. A smiling model in blue jeans holds the product at lower-third, shot with wide-angle lens distortion."
caption.short: "Sale poster with 'SALE 50% OFF' text and A smiling model in blue jeans model holding product"

Generate ONLY the YAML block without any additional text, don't add "addCriterion" or anything else.
